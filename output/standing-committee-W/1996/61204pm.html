	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Hague.</i>]</p></q></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to local government, its expenditure, priorities and the quality of services that it provides and enables to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are critical of my right hon. Friend's proposals for total standard spending in Wales, even though he has not yet published any details. It is surely axiomatic that any organisation or body in the public sector bids for more resources than it has previously received or, indeed, expects to receive. It is self evident that, in the public sector, everyone could spend more than has been allocated. Spending commitments and priorities can always be expanded and increased with additional resources. It does not follow, however, that the quality of services would necessarily be improved. The task of local authorities and, indeed, the art of spending taxpayers' money is to ensure value for money within the set budget, not to complain and make excuses for low-quality services by alleging that central Government have not allocated sufficient resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents, who live in the new unitary authority, Conwy county borough, are becoming disillusioned, concerned and alarmed by the new authority's policies and the prospect of deteriorating services in the Colwyn Bay area and beyond. As a local council taxpayer myself, both I and local authority-elected members share their concerns. My constituents say that they were generally content with the level and quality of services provided and enabled by the former Colwyn borough council. I reaffirm that which I have repeated many times: Colwyn borough council was an exemplary local authority. Its elected members acted responsibly in the interests of electors. Party politics were generally relegated in favour of quality, value for money and the greater good of the people of the borough. In this, they were well supported by consciencious and able officers, well lead and well motivated to enhance the quality of life in the borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to cite one or two examples to illustrate my point. Colwyn Contracts, a thoroughly professional body, not only fulfilled its commitments to general satisfaction, but recorded a surplus of £200,000 in the last financial year. The environmental health department not only met its statutory duties satisfactorily, but pressed outside bodies, including
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Welsh Water and the Welsh Office, to expedite its programmes to enhance the environment. I recall, in particular, the pressure on Welsh Water—no pun intended—to clean up the beaches and bathing water in the region. That programme is now well advanced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how his remarks are relevant to the implications of the Budget for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Hughes. While my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can allocate resources to local authorities, the onus for the quality of services rests with the local authorities. There is a limit to my right hon. Friend's powers in relation to the spending of those resources, especially on education. I wish to draw a distinction between a well-run local authority and an authority that does not spend the resources that it has received—and those that it will receive under the Budget—on the provision of quality services and ensuring value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents reflect longingly on times past, but now increasingly realise that the new authority, Conwy county borough, reflects the standards, culture and ethos of the discredited Aberconwy borough council. This April, Aberconwy borough and Colwyn borough were joined together to form Conwy county borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aberconwy borough council, unlike Colwyn borough council, is widely regarded as having been something of a disgrace. Indeed, my right hon. Friend's predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member of for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), would have capped it, had not the disaster of severe flooding in Llandudno in the summer of 1993 rescued it. Its environmental health department was almost criminally negligent. It did not fulfill its statutory duties of inspection and enforcement, and such inaction led to several incidents of food poisoning. Indeed, when those matters were drawn to my attention during my time in office, I considered asking the Secretary of State to invoke his powers to take control of environmental health matters from Aberconwy borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because time is short, and I know that you, Mr. Hughes, want to call many other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason that the suggested action was not executed was the imminence of local government reform, which necessitated the disbanding of the errant environmental health department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarity, but unlike Colwyn Contracts, Grwp Aberconwy, which still exists, was inefficient, wasteful and reportedly corrupt. It recorded a loss of more than £500,000 in the last financial year. The new authority, Conwy county borough, has sought to cover up that loss with creative accounting—a transfer of money from a capital account which would leave Grwp Aberconwy's account broadly neutral this financial year. Of course, that is to the disadvantage of my constituents, who are having to bail out the indiscretions of their former neighbours. I understand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is already conducting an inquiry into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
the management of Grwp Aberconwy and I urge him to press ahead with vigour so that the full extent of the mismanagement can be made public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my constituents had reservations about the reform of local government as it affected them. The principles underlying the reform were well understood and generally accepted. Indeed, the reforms have worked well throughout Wales—with the notable exception of Conwy county borough. They have not worked as well as was hoped because of the unique circumstances of the region. The preserved county boundary between Clwyd and Gwynedd, which remains for the time being, continues to remind us of those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of sadness to me and to local authority members that our high hopes for Conwy county borough have already been dashed and that there is no sign that the fundamental differences between the nature of Aberconwy from Gwynedd, and Colwyn from Clwyd, can be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aberconwy, with the exception of Llandudno, looks to and identifies with its neighbouring authorities in Gwynedd. Indeed, its culture, ethos and way of life are those of the former county of Gwynedd. [Hon. Members: "Come on!"] This is crucial to the point that I am about to make on the Budget and its implications for my constituents. It is important that hon. Members understand that there is a distinction between the two parts of the county borough which will lead to unfairness in the allocation of the resources that my right hon. Friend will provide to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have stated, members of Conwy borough council from the west bank of the River Conwy behave, act and vote as an Aberconwy group. Local members from the three opposition parties and independents belong to that group, but two Conservative members from that region do not. This is central to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The east bank of the River Conwy—the former Colwyn borough—identifies with and looks towards the east. Its culture, ethos and way of life are not those of the former Gwynedd. Its elected members form groups along party political lines, although the Labour group is inevitably subjected to the party whip and supports the Labour leader of the council, who happens to be a Gwynedd man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has meant, and will continue to mean unless changes are brought about, that the authority's resources are being diverted unfairly to Aberconwy—to the great disadvantage of my constituents and the Colwyn Bay region. That is causing increasing concern to my constituents and their local representatives. There are already many examples of how Conwy county borough council discriminates against the people of Colwyn as a consequence of historical and cultural differences between the two sides of the River Conwy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened to the hon. Gentleman with great patience for the past 10 minutes. He will be aware that the Budget was delivered only eight days ago I cannot for the life of me see what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
relevance his remarks have to that Budget. I hope that he will now come to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Hughes, one responsibility of local authorities is education. While my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no power to dictate to local authorities how money should be spent—for example, in local management of schools schemes—nevertheless, if the resources put into local government are not being distributed in a way of which electors and others approve, that is a matter of concern for my right hon. Friend and, indeed, for me and local authority representatives. I shall now turn to education, Mr. Hughes, and perhaps my point will become clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In education, the loading of the local management of schools scheme in favour of Welsh-medium schools deprives Colwyn Bay schools of funds to which they are entitled. Schools on the west bank are predominantly Welsh-medium schools; schools to the east of the river are predominantly not Welsh-medium. That loading cannot be better exemplified than by Conwy LEA' s proposed implementation of the nursery voucher scheme—a scheme that the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) mentioned in his remarks. Conwy proposes 50 per cent. funding for Welsh-medium provision and 25 per cent. funding for the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In secondary education, the discrimination is even more blatant. The three schools in my constituency that fall within Conwy county borough council are all grant maintained. The common funding formula is determined by the LMS scheme of the local education authority. It is clear that the weighting applied within the formula—in addition to Welsh-medium weighting—with regard to total pupil numbers and the size of sixth forms is to the disadvantage of the popular GM schools in my constituency. The criteria for free school meals and transport are similarly discriminatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude of the new unitary authority, Conwy county borough council, is illustrated by its cavalier approach to expenditure on the west bank. A proposal for a mussel purification plant in Conwy will go ahead, even though the lowest tender of £206,000 was £56,000 above budget. The director of property services was handed delegated powers to complete the contract without any budgetary limit. The Labour leader of Conwy county borough council said:
	<br><q><p>"We should let the director get on with it, and if it is a few grand over, so what?"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is being fair to the Committee. He has not addressed the subject of the debate at all. If he cannot do so in the next few moments, I shall ask him to resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making, Mr. Hughes, is that my right hon. Friend, with the best will in the world, allocates resources to local government to enable services to be provided. A moment ago, I quoted a leader of a council, who said:
	<br><q><p>"if it is a few grand over, so what?"</p></q>
If local authorities do not spend money on a value-for-money basis, and therefore waste money, my right hon. Friend must bear that in mind when he considers total
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
spending and allocation of resources to those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief; I want to make just one or two more points. I have a proposal to put to my right hon. Friend for his consideration. Under section 56 of the Local Government Act 1972, my right hon. Friend, if he is so minded, can ask the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales to conduct a review of the area that is currently the responsibility of Conwy county borough council, and of surrounding areas. The commission could make any of several recommendations, including constituting a new local government area—effectively creating a new unitary authority. There are many possibilities, but the option favoured by many of my constituents is a new unitary authority made up of the former Colwyn borough council plus Llandudno—the east bank of the River Conwy. The west bank, consisting of Aberconwy minus Llandudno, could be joined with Gwynedd, where many believe it would be more at home. Under section 58 of the 1972 Act, my right hon. Friend may, by order, give effect to proposals made by the commission with or without modification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be prescriptive or to pre-empt any deliberation that my right hon. Friend might command; I merely ask that he considers the matter. I emphasise that primary legislation would not be required. I emphasise also that the divorce advocated by my constituents and their locally elected representatives on the ground of incompatibility has no bearing whatever on the reform of local government elsewhere in Wales, where it has been relatively harmonious and successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is with serious intent that I put those matters before my right hon. Friend. Were there another way to ensure the effectiveness of the resources that he allocates through the public sector, in particular to local government, I would have explored it. My constituents feel that it is time to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is probably my last Welsh Grand Committee, Mr. Hughes. I had thought that there would not be another before I retired from the House. It is great to have this forum today. My predecessor in Gower, Mr. Ifor Davies, chaired the Welsh Grand Committee with distinction for many years. When he told me about this forum, I did not sleep for many nights before my first Grand Committee. He would have saved me many sleepless nights if his description of the results that came out of this forum had been nearer the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are kind to call me, Mr. Hughes. I wish to make just three points. First, whichever Government—including this Government—introduces a Budget, one test that must be applied is to see how far it departs from the difference between the monetary economy and the real economy. No matter what attempts the Government make to get the unemployment figures down; no matter what attempts they make to ensure that people who sign on the dole state that they do no work; no matter how much the state hounds individuals who might, for example, paint and decorate a friend's house—they are grilled on why they signed the form stating that they had no work; no matter what the trade-off between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
unemployment and inflation; no matter what the tradeoff between the balance of payments surplus and every other indicator—for me, there is one fundamental point, and it is the obscenity that people are now sleeping rough on the streets of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen people sleeping rough on the streets of London for a long time. Thirty years ago, when I lived in the city of Istanbul, I never thought that in this country, and especially in Wales, the real economy would mean so many people having to sleep rough. No matter what camouflage, no matter what window dressing is attempted in the Budget, one thing is clear—the obscenity of poverty diminishes us all. It is a slur on all of us, including the Government, that an underclass is growing in Wales. That underclass is dangerous to our well being. I shall not go into the problems of hepatitis A, B, C and, now, D, as that virus mutates uncontrollably, but in ignoring the growth of that underclass we pose enormous risks to ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is directly related to the Budget. The Chancellor of the Exchequer issued a Treasury press release, HMT3, on 26 November. I found it deeply offensive. It mentioned the Department of Social Security and the right hon. and learned Gentleman seemed to be proud of the fact that the Benefits Agency had set up a national benefit fraud hotline in August this year which had received more than 100,000 calls in its first three months. I call it the spy line. There is a charter in Wales, introduced by the Benefits Agency, encouraging people to make anonymous calls, which could be malicious in the first order. They could be made against neighbours, which is an intrusion into their privacy. Agents of the state respond to those anonymous calls, many of which are malicious. People are being encouraged to spy on their neighbours and to report what they are doing. Most of those anonymous calls have no basis in fact, so I hope that the Minister will tell us that he will ensure that the police will trace those callers and prosecute them for malicious calls if there is no truth in them. It is dangerous in the extreme for the government to go down that path. I know that there are neighbourhood watch schemes, but for the Government to set up a pernicious, spying, snooping line is wholly distasteful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Grand Committee is an interesting body. It is a unique—y pwyllgor uchaf—upper Committee. That is a fascinating description of what we engage in among ourselves, with friends, colleagues, political opponents or whoever. There would be merit in reconsidering the format and perhaps changing it along the lines of European Standing Committees. We could have Question Time for the first hour, in which all hon. Members could participate, and then have an all-around debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued many times for debates on the reports of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, but they have never materialised. They would be useful, even if they happened only occasionally. It is 13 years this month since I had the honour of chairing the Welsh Affairs Committee. It has been a great privilege both to be Chairman of that Committee and to be here to serve under you, Mr. Hughes. You have chaired this Committee wonderfully, as did your predecessors, the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
former Member of Parliament for Neath and the great Ifor Davies, who represented Gower for 22 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank you again, Mr. Hughes. I hope that the Minister will address himself to the camouflage and to the spy line to see whether there is a possibility for Wales to be treated differently from England. Perhaps they need spies in England, but we do not need them in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning the Secretary of State for Wales presented a rosy picture and claimed that there was a booming economy in Wales. No one on the Opposition Benches recognised that picture. We know from our surgeries what is going on and the problems that our constitutents face. If the Secretary of State had a Welsh constituency, perhaps he would understand that his picture was not accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth examining what the right hon. Gentleman said, especially about public expenditure. We should look at the Red Book and the press release that he issued. The front page of the press release states:
	<br><q><p>"Following the Chancellor's Budget statement, Mr. Hague said: 'The need for a higher level of spending in Wales compared to England has once again been recognised' ".</p></q>
Those of us who represent Welsh constituencies know why that has been recognised year after year. Levels of deprivation are far higher in Wales than in England. Wages are about 10 per cent. lower in Wales than they are in England. In some areas, especially the peripheral parts—west, north-west and south-west Wales—levels are way below the Welsh, United Kingdom and European averages. The Sea Empress economic impact inquiry identified south-west Wales as having the same per capita income as parts of rural Portugal. That is the reality of parts of the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is deprived in terms of health and social services. Through no fault of our own, the mere fact that we are in the western part of Europe means that we have some of the most severely disadvantaged areas for agriculture. All those factors justify a per capita expenditure for Wales higher than that for England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know whether the level of public expenditure that the Secretary of State announced in the press release will answer the needs of Wales. I argue that it will not. it certainly will not meet the needs in this financial year—witness the problems in local government where there have been council tax rises in excess of 20 per cent., but local authorities have still had to cut services. People who need care in the community and those who need home helps are having to dig into their benefits to pay for those services. There are further problems in our education service. That, rather than the rosy picture that the Secretary of State painted, is the reality in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the reality as shown in the Red Book and the Secretary of State's press release—not on the front page, but on the second page. Despite all the problems in the services that are directly funded through public expenditure, the Secretary of State proposes to cut £60 million from the budget for this financial year. He intends to cut a further £60 million
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
from public expenditure in 1997–98, £150 million in 1998–99, and £110 million in 1999–2000. Over five years, there will be a total of £380 million reduction in public expenditure in Wales for our health service, our education, our roads, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the Secretary of State and some of his hon. Friends kept asking my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) what the Labour Party would do. We are debating the Government's Budget, however, so we need to ask from where that £380 million will be cut—I will gladly give way to enable the Secretary of State to explain that. Will it be taken from the health service? The Secretary of State assured us that if the Conservatives are re-elected, there will be year-on-year growth in real terms in the health budget. We can debate that. I am willing to accept, for the sake of the argument, that he can meet his promise. If he does, however, there will have to be even worse cuts in all the other services, because the health budget forms such a significant part of public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the money be taken from agriculture, which has taken the hammering of BSE? Will it be taken from social services, which are under enormous pressure because so many more elderly people are living longer and needing support in the community? Will it be taken from our education service? Even the Secretary of State recognises that more needs to be spent on education, but the only way in which he can honour his promise of year-on-year growth in the health service is by cutting social services, education and every other service funded by the Welsh Office. Otherwise, the equation does not add up and is nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities are to take that hammering, one of the problems that it will cause my—and many other—constituents is that education will not be improved in the way that those in industry, the political class and parents who want their children to have the best opportunities desire. If those cuts go ahead, the Welsh economy will be even more disadvantaged in the long term. The only way in which Wales can climb up the prosperity league table, in relation to not only England, but the rest of Europe—and it must do so, because it is languishing virtually at the bottom—is by investing in its people, especially its young people, and by having a highly educated and skilled work force. The Budget sends a clear message that those who want increased expenditure on education and training will have to wait for a different Government. The Red Book shows that in England, and presumably in Wales, there will be year-on-year cuts in education and employment. That is the reality of the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales also has severe infrastructure problems, nowhere more so than in my constituency and that of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis). Way back in August 1992, a report by Conran Roche Planning, funded at considerable cost by the Welsh Office, analysed infrastructure problems and suggested solutions; it reported to the task force which had the then Secretary of State as its chairman. One of the main objectives it listed in regard to infrastructure in west Wales was the identification of priority road schemes; it also suggested improvement in rail facilities and the attraction of new investment in telecommunications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
The A40 Whitland bypass, the A47 Sageston-Redberth bypass, the A40 Trefgarn Rocks improvement and additional trunk road improvements on the A477, as part of improving the Pembrokeshire connection, were all identified as priority projects. Those objectives were set out in August 1992. Four years later, only one of the infrastructure projects has been opened—by one of the Secretary of State's colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be partnership with local government to improve the infrastructure of west Wales, the Welsh Office and local authorities must have a Budget that enables them to invest. At a time when everyone is scrambling for a Millennium Commission project, one of the main problems has been the lack of matching funding for some wonderful, imaginative projects—large and small. The same problem exists for projects that could be funded by the European Union. Such important projects—which are, sadly, discretionary, as opposed to the statutory responsibilities that local authorities always try to honour—are not given the resources in the Budget to go ahead, even though the Millennium Fund or the lottery, for example, may be willing to come in as partners. The same goes for projects that could be funded by the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take up a point that my hon. Friend the Member of Gower (Mr. Wardell) made, two nasty and mean proposals constitute a distressing and disturbing aspect of the Budget. They are not simply proposals—as we all know, they will go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is the change in housing benefit rules. Several middle-aged men, including a constituent who wrote to me this week, have expressed grave anxieties. They are unemployed. They used to live with their elderly parents, who died, and they now occupy the family home. Under current rules, they receive housing benefit that covers the full amount of rent. Under the Chancellor's proposals, if they are fortunate enough to find a job, but are subsequently made redundant, they are not guaranteed the same level of housing benefit. Instead, they will receive the area average. For many people, that will mean a significant reduction in housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also applies to single parents. We are not simply considering the allegedly feckless individuals whom the right hon. Member for Wokingham was so fond of identifying when he was Secretary of State. The provision applies to widows, divorced women and, in some cases, widowers and divorced men. Again, the Government penalise the victims by cutting the single parent allowance. That is mean and miserable—it reflects the Government's ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency and the whole of south-west Wales have huge structural and economic problems. They can be tackled only by significant investment by the Welsh Office in partnership with other organisations and the European Union. The Budget gives no hope of structural improvements to tackle the huge problems, which are no fault of the people of Pembrokeshire or south Carmarthenshire. Whatever nice noises and promises the Secretary of State makes, the Budget has failed Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly in support of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Gower said that he would apply several key tests to the Budget. I shall add a couple of tests that the Budget also fails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider whether, in the light of current economic circumstances, the Budget is fair, just and honest and whether it provides proper choices. A rational assessment of what the Government have said in the Welsh Grand Committee shows that they have failed to achieve those aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let us consider fairness. Several policy objectives and options are open to the Government. Yet all their chosen objectives and policy decisions have compounded unfairness. Let us assume that the Government have a pot of money that they can use to cut taxes. The Budget has increased indirect taxes, but let us assume that the Government have a pot of money. What have they chosen to do? They have cut direct income tax at a time when the Opposition suggested value added tax on fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government opted for an income tax cut that benefits only those people in work and disproportionately affects those people who earn the highest incomes in Wales. If they wished, the Government could have promoted the idea of tax cuts on fairness alone, but, as my hon. Friends have shown, they are not a tax-cutting party. Tax cuts could have been made in a much fairer and more equitable way. I am sorry that Conservative Members last night voted against the Labour party's proposals to cut value added tax on fuel and persisted in pursuing their decision to cut income tax, which will compound unfairness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Labour party's pledge on VAT on fuel, which he said would be so much fairer. Perhaps he would share with the Committee the weekly benefit to the average household in Wales from the proposed reduction in VAT on fuel. Does he agree with me that it would be 10p a week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures available on families in Wales. But many of my constituents would much rather there was a cut in indirect taxation—value added tax—than the cut in direct taxation proposed by the Government. The Government purport to be a tax-cutting Government, but direct taxation, coupled with additional indirect taxation such as insurance tax, airport tax, council tax, cuts in profit-related pay and higher charges for families throughout Wales, hits those ofmy constituents who are on fixed incomes. Pensioners, people who are unemployed, and those on a lower income, as many people in Wales are, do not benefit from tax cuts and they are hit hard by indirect tax cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not be surprised by that; the Conservative Government have shifted taxation from the poor to the rich throughout their 17 years in government. In 1979, when my party left office, the poorest fifth of the population paid 31 per cent. of their income in tax, compared with 38 per cent. of the richest fifth. Now,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
taxes for the poorest people in Wales and the United Kingdom as a whole have risen dramatically to 40 per cent. of their income, while taxes for the richest fifth have dropped to 36 per cent. of their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's shift from direct to indirect taxation is unfair and unjust because it hits people on fixed incomes hardest. The Budget also fails people dramatically in terms of their choices. As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) said very eloquently, the biggest issue facing my constituents as a result of the Budget is its impact on council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to press the Secretary of State on the Welsh Office's expenditure plans for council tax spending. There are cuts in real terms in the total Welsh Office spending in the next three to four years in the Budget proposals. A 2.3 per cent. cut is proposed in 1998–99, a 1.6 per cent. cut in 1999–2000 and a 0.9 per cent. in the next two years. There is a cut in real terms in the amount of money provided by the Welsh Office for public services, of which local government is a major factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales must state where he expects those real-terms cuts to fall, because they are being made when the impact of the BSE crisis will hit Welsh Office expenditure heavily, and when the Government are committed to increasing unfairness in education by pumping money into the assisted places scheme. The Government are committed to additional resources for the health service. That policy implication, coupled with a real-terms cut in the amount spent by the Welsh Office overall means that my constituents face dramatic public expenditure cuts in many public services in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I want to press the Minister on the public spending settlement for local government. My county, Flintshire, and my partial county of Denbighshire—I shall lose my part of it at the general election to a new constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may lose all of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be losing the lot, as the Minister suggests. Boundary changes make my seat even safer than it was at the last election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to mention the personal vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to mention my personal vote, which is flowing in daily and even as we speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flintshire faces real difficulties and the Minister must answer on those. If the money given to local government is to be cut—and it is—and if housing investment and real-terms education spending are to be cut by the Welsh Office, I hope that the Minister will have the honesty to say that the Conservatives are taking with one hand and taking with the other, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will put up council tax in my part of the world by considerable amounts because of the considerable reduction in central grant to Flintshire. When my constituents have to pay bigger council tax
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
bills in April and have to complain about the poorer level of services, I hope that the Minister will say that those decisions were not the result of Labour or independent councils mismanaging services but the direct result of stand-still and real-term cuts proposed in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flintshire does not want to increase the tax burden that the Government are imposing on my constituents, but will be faced with doing so if the real-term cuts proposed for Welsh Office spending go ahead. Will the Minister be honest and say what rise he expects in council tax, what the cuts in public service will be and that both are a direct result of his Government's policies, not the decisions of local councils that are battling hard to protect public services?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have failed on all the issues before us. They have raised indirect taxation; they have reduced the money spent on decent public services; they have added to the ordinary family's tax burden; they have done nothing for pensioners, nothing for the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have failed to tackle the real structural problems of constituencies such as mine in north Wales, which needs investment and infrastructure, support for public transport, action to help replace jobs lost at Point of Ayr colliery and the steelworks. My constituency needs help to ensure real wage increases and the introduction of the minimum wage. It needs action from Government to stimulate growth and tackle the economic pressure we face from Merseyside and Manchester over the English border. We need proper, hands-on Government investment. We need a Government committed to improve public services, relieve the tax burden and make sure that fairness and justice are the hallmarks of the Budget. The Budget has failed on all those counts. I hope that my hon. Friends reject it, as they did last night and will at the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by taking up the argument made by Conservative Members against my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly. They asked him to specify budgetary commitments for Labour in government. What I have to say is something that seems to rouse Conservative Members to a juvenile frenzy, the only thing that has in this Session. Simply, no serious Opposition have ever been seriously expected to put forward detailed budgetary commitments while still in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I caution the Secretary of State and his hon. Friends that we will remind them, when they are in opposition, of what they said. We will challenge them to produce detailed budgetary commitments and exact spending plans on health and education in Wales. They will be unable to do so for the simple reasons that Oppositions are not in any position to present detailed commitments of the kind that the Conservatives expect of my hon. Friend. It would not have been responsible of him to give such commitments beyond a general policy specification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that he will be putting forward the Labour party's taxation proposals before the general election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The shadow Chancellor has made it absolutely clear that we shall put forward our broad tax policies before the next general election, giving the electorate a clear signal as to our intentions. I am glad that the Secretary of State has intervened on that matter because I can explain to him that, when we outline our tax policies, we will have the opportunity to nail the many lies that are coming from Conservative Members—including, I regret to say, lies from him—on what Labour's tax plans are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a few weeks ago, the Secretary of State said that Labour would load another £1,200—an enormous fantasy figure—on the average family in Wales in extra taxation. It is the Conservatives who have piled hundreds and hundreds of pounds of extra taxation on ordinary families in Wales—to the tune of £2,120 since the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we make our tax plans clear, we shall be able to nail that lie easily. We will show that Labour stands for fair taxation and, in particular, for getting rid of the whole philosphy underpinning this Budget—that those at the bottom of the pile suffer most from Conservative tax policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the impact of the Budget on local council taxes because I know that it is to be the subject of a statement next week. Last year, council taxes in Wales went up by 19 per cent. compared with the United Kingdom average of 6 per cent. The Secretary of State suggested that the increase would be much lower this year. All of us would welcome that. He said that there would be no excuse for local authorities to raise council taxes to the level that they were forced to do—by his punitive cuts—last year. In my constituency, for example, the council of Neath and Port Talbot was forced to make cuts of £10 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Savage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, they were savage. We appealed to the Secretary of State on numerous occasions that, as a result of the share-out following the abolition of county councils and district authorities last year, we were saddled with a discriminatory settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.02 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that Neath and Port Talbot council was previously the subject of a discriminatory settlement. I hope that, before the Secretary of State's statement next week, extra consideration will be given to at least compensating the county borough council for that punitive settlement, which involved £10 million cuts and a huge council tax rise after damping at 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said in his speech—it was a theme of his Budget contribution—that unemployment in Wales had been falling. The official claimant count
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
has been falling, but unemployment remains stubbornly high, especially in valley communities and areas such as that represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke. Alternative ways of measuring unemployment give a different figure from the official one. I have obtained from the House of Commons Library the latest comparisons with respect to the Government's economic inactivity figures. They show that economic inactivity in Wales increased by about 16.4 per cent. between spring 1991 and spring 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That increase represents, largely, people who have been smuggled off the official claimant count figures, and who languish either on income support or in the jobless wilderness. Most of them—almost all of them, apart from a tiny minority who are disabled or sick—would want to work. Total unemployment is still stubbornly high. Incidentally, the 16.4 per cent. increase over the past five years related to men, but the proportion has increased for women and for all persons of working age as well. Now, 20 per cent. of men of working age in Wales are economically inactive. When that is added to the official unemployment figure for men in Wales, which is 10 per cent., the total is 30 per cent. The Secretary of State argued that the Budget improved the employment situation, but he should take it into account that it does nothing of the sort and that real unemployment in Wales remains very high, especially for men. Nothing in the Budget addressed that intractable problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I welcome the Secretary of State's statement that inward investment in future will be located further west down the M4 corridor—as far as it is possible to go. I particularly welcome his commitment to encourage suppliers to LG and other inward investors to locate up the valleys. I know that he has shown a great deal of sympathy with some of our ideas in Neath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I acknowledge that the Secretary of State, compared with his predecessor, attempts to do a serious job on behalf of Wales, but I make a plea for an intelligent debate in the run-up to the general election, for example, on taxation. It is simply no good enough for someone in his position to pick a figure out of thin air—for example, that Labour will impose a £1,200 tax hike on the average household—when that is pure fantasy and a pure lie. We should have a serious argument about levels of public provision and taxation, and not close our eyes, pick figures and indulge in fantasy. That does not encourage mature and intelligent political debate and, frankly, he should know better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate comes after 12 months of farce—the farce of this Committee not meeting. I understand very well that the Welsh Office is happy not to have Welsh Grand Committee meetings and would willingly give the Opposition a veto on the matter. That would allow Ministers to avoid being answerable to Welsh Members of Parliament and I have no doubt that that is part of the Government's strategy. The planting of questions at Welsh Question Time on Monday was an example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
The planting of questions and the avoidance of answerability in the Committee are two reasons why we need an elected Parliament for Wales instead of a Welsh Grand Committee talking shop. The argument will be better understood at home after what has happened in the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now debating the effects of the Budget in Wales without having the Welsh Office detailed papers available. That is different from the pattern in Scotland where, next week, the Scottish Office papers will be made available two days before the Scottish Grand Committee sits. Here, we must depend on the UK Red Book with a massive difference of opinion on the interpretation of the tables that it contains. That is not good enough. If we are to have a meaningful debate on the effects of the Budget in Wales, we need the figures on which to make a judgment. I hope that in future years, if the Committee is still in existence, that will be taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives of any Budget strategy for Wales should be, first, to tackle the persistent high unemployment in Wales. Some 100,000 people are officially acknowledged as unemployed, but the real figure is substantially higher. Unemployment has fallen in some areas, but there are still bad pockets and we need a strategy to tackle them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second strategic objective should be to raise the level of income per head. Wales has the lowest income per head of any country or region in Britain. During the past 12 months, since the Committee last sat, gross domestic product in Wales has been overtaken by that of the Republic of Ireland for the first time. That shows the failure of successive Government policies in ensuring that we have an appropriate and adequate economy, following the rundown of the old heavy industries on which our income per head and our gross national product was predicated until the past couple of decades. We must maximise ways of developing the potential of existing companies in Wales, attracting new ones and triggering indigenous enterprise, to which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third objective should be to have a strategy to provide for equitable distribution of wealth and income in Wales. The Budget certainly did not do that. The analysis in 	<i>The Independent</i> on the day after the Budget showed that the top 30 per cent. of income earners would be almost £7 a week better off and the bottom 30 per cent. 50p a week worse off. In other words, the poverty gap gets worse as a direct result of the Budget. That is unacceptable in Wales. We need to ensure fairer distributions between social groups, especially pensioners, because of their needs and the abominably low increase given to them. They have had no more than a couple of quid. I am reminded of the way in which they have lost out in the past 16 years since pensions were uncoupled from average earnings. They are now more than £20 a week worse off than they would have been had that link been maintained. If a new Government are returned I hope that they can find some way of committing themselves to giving pensioners
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
what they deserve—a much fairer deal. The Labour party and many Welsh people want that for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth objective is a framework of policies that are environmentally sustainable. The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned this, but I suspect that it was lip service as opposed to a genuine intention to tackle some of the more difficult policies, including the policy on urban pollution. That agenda should cross political boundaries. I am thinking of Cardiff and other cities whose pollution level, especially in summer, will make that a necessary objective in coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth objective in Budget strategy should be to maintain or improve basic public services—health, housing, education, transport, social services and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to some of the Budget's effects on Wales. We are seeing an inevitable reduction in public spending. I heard the arguments this morning and the quoting of various tables from the Red Book. But table 5A.5, headed Control total by departments in real terms, shows a reduction in real terms. The reduction from the current year to next year and for the subsequent year is illustrated graphically. The figures may be an increase on previous figures for Government plans, but previous plans are not what matters. What matters is how we shall do and whether we shall be worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comparable figure for the United Kingdom as a whole is an increase of £3 billion from the current year to 1999. In other words, Wales's share in the control total is going down while the overall control total is increasing. However the Secretary of State juggles the figures and tries to justify them in monetary terms, that is the reality of his policy. He must justify it because consequences will flow from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned housing this morning. I am extremely worried about the 30 per cent. reduction in the Welsh housing budget from £89 million to £60 million. That cannot be acknowledged by the Committee's Welsh Office team because we do not have the official figures. But when they are published next week it will be seen as part of the cuts that will be made, side by side with cuts in education and training, which Opposition Members mentioned this morning, making a total reduction of £100 million in real terms, which tallies with the figure given in the Red Book. That figure happens to be more or less the product of a 1p reduction in income tax in Wales. What a small coincidence!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I voted again this year, as we did last year, against a reduction in income tax. We believe in public spending on public services. Anyone who does must also believe in finding the means of financing them. Of all the means available, income tax is the fairest. With all sincerity I ask all Opposition Members to vote against a reduction in income tax because that, surely, is an agenda that is common to all of us. We need the income that comes from income tax to maintain services that are so greatly needed in Wales. It would be much more honourable to admit that we want higher public spending, accept that some taxes will have to be increased again, and state the limit that we could live with so as to meet what we regard as necessary social priorities in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the standard rate of income tax should be 25p in the pound. There is a need for a significant increase in the tax threshold. My hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn mentioned this morning that we had advocated a £500 increase in the personal tax level. That would take 830,000 people out of tax. If it was applied to the over-65 tax threshold as well, a further 300,000 people in the United Kingdom would be taken out of tax. The figures are 50,000 and 20,000 for Wales. That, and more, could be paid for by doing away with the upper limit on the employee's national insurance contribution.

It is ridiculous that there should be a cut-off at £455 a week. That means that a person on £30,000 a year has a lower marginal tax rate than a person on £10,000 a year. A person on £10,000 a year paying the standard rate of income tax together with national insurance, will have a marginal tax rate of 33p in the pound when the Budget has gone through, compared with 23p in the pound for someone who is earning £30,000 a year. That cannot possibly make any sense in social or economic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By removing that ceiling, we could pay for the increase tax thresholds. An increase in income tax is needed in order to ensure that we bring people back into work who are currently out of work, and pay people a fair wage—£160 a week—to do the work that is needed in all our communities. They should be paid £160 a week to do the work rather than £80 a week to rot on the dole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question of social priorities. We believe that we should advocate those priorities because that is what is needed in Wales. If we can get that action here, all well and good. My fear is that Westminster will never do that. That is why we need our own Parliament in Cardiff to do the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priorities that have been established in the Budget are continuing to improve the national health service and education and to provide extra resources for combating crime. I believe that those are the right priorities. It is also right that we should seek to reduce public spending where we can. We should target social security payments and try to get maximum value for money from public finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also right that the Government have introduced improved tax incentives for families. The more families stay together, the less pressure there is on housing. Much of the demand for public housing is produced by marriage breakdown and by young people leaving home when in a more stable family environment they would stay with their parents. Families on average income will be significantly better off than they were at the time of the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been criticised for changes that are likely to lead to higher council taxes. It is fair to say that the setting of the level of council tax is a matter for local authorities. It is also fair to say that 88 per cent. of the cost of local government comes from the rate support grant. The Welsh people do better under their council tax than do their English counterparts. It is right that a significant proportion of the cost of local government should be borne locally in order to increase accountability but it is up to the electorate to tell their councillors—particularly their Labour councillors because so many local authorities are under Labour control—that they will not stand huge increases in council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when United Kingdom growth is stronger than that in any other major European Union country and when, instead of being the sick man of Europe as we were the last time we had a Labour Government, we now lead Europe on growth, employment, inward investment and low social costs, it seems strange that the hon. Member for Caerphilly castigates the Government for our alleged mismanagement of the economy. He does not seem to be familiar with the expression, "the pot calling the kettle black". The situation has changed beyong recognition for the better under the Conservatives and it would be gratifying if we could receive just a little of the credit that we deserve from the Opposition for the considerable achievements under our Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caerphilly repeatedly ducked the question of what he would advocate in terms of public spending. By implication he criticised the Conservatives for spending too little in the public sector, yet he was careful, presumably under strict instructions from on high, not to let the cat out of the bag as to how much he would spend, were he to swap places with the Secretary of State. We know that nationally we could expect £30 billion per annum of additional spending under Labour. We know that either taxes or borrowing would go up, or both. I should have

liked to have heard in this debate—I hope that we may still hear it when the Opposition wind up—how much Labour intends to raise taxes or, alternatively, how much they intend to increase borrowing, and what would be the effect on the Welsh economy of either or both those measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national debt burden has been lower every year under the Conservatives than it was in any year under the previous Labour Government. We are tightening borrowing by £1.75 billion next year. Labour would, presumably, let borrowing run out of control. Our basic rate of income tax is now the lowest for 60 years. That helps every single income tax payer in Wales. I look forward to further steady growth in the Welsh economy under this Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney) but, given the time, I would like to direct a few remarks to the Secretary of State and to my hon. Friends on Front Bench. I believe that an incoming Labour Government will face a unique situation. I cannot think of a comparable situation in any previous Labour Government's inheritancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem is that there is a curious disconnection now between the public finances and the economy itself. I admit to the Secretary of State that bits of the British economy are working and growing, and parts of the Welsh economy are growing. In my community, Halla and US Can have improved all the location and environmental obstacles to development and they are being progressively removed. That is admitted, but alongside those improvements the so-called competitive economy has created a huge number of victims in our communities and speech after speech has been identifying who those big names are. Even those in work are victims as a result of low wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed some amazing figures—in 1976, 5,000 people in Wales were collecting family income supplement. In 1995, 38,000 were collecting it. It is a major transfer of cost from employer to the state. The Government have had to change the rules to include part-time workers. They have had to top up part-time income. It is a reflection of the low-wage economy and both figures illustrate that. The point that I am making is that we have seen a significant transfer of cost from employers to the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In column after column, we find the same thing—the cost of long-term unemployment is a debt that has accumulated. The amazing increase in the number of people having to receive benefits in one form or another is a sign of the transfer of costs. The cost of training, once borne by the employer, is increasingly having to be borne by the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reason. This competitive economy had to be a low-wage, low-tax economy, so that we could attract inward investment and it has partially worked. The trouble is that the gamble has worked only partially and we now have an economy that is not growing sufficiently to finance the victims of that competitive economy. We have a large number of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
victims in our communities. That is shown by the large number of long-term unemployed, the levels of economic inactivity that my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) identified and every indicator that we can collect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me most is that, of course, I could see what the Thatcher Government was all about—the economy was restructured to become this new competitive economy on a low-tax, low-wage basis in the hope that it would grow sufficiently so that one could eventually take away the props of benefit. It is a rich irony that the state has intervened in the lives of more people under this Government that it ever did before. It is actually the most intrusive state in modern Welsh and British history, in terms of the impact it has upon individuals in our community. The Government have rolled back the state corporations. They have not rolled back the role of the state in the lives of individuals, who are now more dependent on the state than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real worry is that the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) is the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security and therefore knows the figures very well. It is now beginning to dawn on the Government that the economy is not growing fast enough, but the props that were there to pay for the victims of this competitive economy are having to be removed because public expenditure has been rising. The Government realise that they have to raise taxes or cut public expenditure. So who are they going for? They are going for the prematurely retired, like those in receipt of reduced earnings allowance, and taking away the equivalent of £30 a week. That is a modest amount in the great social security budget, but a huge amount in terms of the lives and budgets of individuals in our community. The Government have, of course, gone for all those who were in receipt of incapacity benefit. They are now going for variety, in terms of housing benefit and the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the very things that cushion the impact of the cost of the competitive economy on so many thousands of individuals are themselves becoming the target of Government cuts. It is extremely worrying and a sad state of affairs. I hate the dependency economy that the Government have created. Most of the people in Rhymney would like to be much more free of the state. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members may laugh, but we would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capricious changes by Ministers affect the lives of our constituents disproportionately. Perhaps none are affected in the Vale of Glamorgan but dozens and dozens are affected in my community. One stroke of a pen from the Social Security Minister means the loss of £30 a week to people in our communities and that is a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The saddest comment that I could make on the Budget and the developments of the past few years is that Lilley is rather more important in our lives at the moment than Hague. Although the Secretary of State for Cymru can show that he has set part of our economy working, alongside that there is now an increasing attack on those who have become the victims of the new competitive economy. Not only will my hon. Friend the

Member for Caerphilly have to cope with that, but so will the whole of the next Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two great puzzles about the proceedings that we have gone through today in the Welsh Grand Committee. The first is about the state of the Welsh economy and the other is about the meaning of the projections for Welsh Office expenditure that are contained within the Red Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's most telling phrase this morning, when he was describing the Welsh economy, was his claim that it was "incredibly successful". If he were to put the emphasis on "incredibly", all members of the Welsh Grand Committee would accept it. The Secretary of State has a new girlfriend: she is called Miss Rosy Scenario. He was out with her last night before he wrote his speech. We have heard a lot about the Secretary of State's girlfriends. I read in the press recently that he is the most eligible bachelor in Wales. His girlfriend, Miss Rosy Scenario, is a rather naughty girl to be going out with; she can lead him into all kinds of wrong paths, straying from the straight and narrow, which he ought not to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Gentleman describes the Welsh economy, Labour Members do not recognise it. We recognise the inward investment successes and the high-profile, big names that arrived many years ago in Wales and are now expanding. We are pleased about that, because they will help to employ our constituents, if they are lucky enough to live nearby and have the right skills. The overall picture of the Welsh economy is nothing like that; neither is the overall picture of the British economy that he painted. He missed out the fact that the public debt has doubled since the Prime Minister came to office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me mention some significant facts that Rosy Scenario told him not to mention today. Between 1990 and 1995, real GDP in Wales rose by 3.3 per cent., compared to 5.4 per cent. in the United Kingdom. He made great play of the fact that Britain has a higher proportion of people in work than any other major economy in Europe, but he ignored the fact that in Wales that is probably not true, in that there are 77 per cent. of people of working age in work in the United Kingdom, but only 72 per cent. in Wales. We are lagging well behind the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State makes great play of the high proportion of people in work, but Wales is lagging 5 per cent. behind. That is highly significant and tends to give the lie to the claim that there is now only a couple of per cent. difference in unemployment between Wales and the United Kingdom average. In terms of the proportion of people in work, we are miles behind, which is why GDP per head is so low in Wales. We have 5.1 per cent. of the United Kingdom population, but only 4 per cent. of the GDP that we generate, which is why tax receipts are relatively low in Wales. That is why I do not agree with the point made by the President of Plaid Cymru a few moments ago. That is the problem: we are not generating sufficient tax receipts because our GDP per head is so low and the gap between us and the United Kingdom is widening, not reducing, in spite of the inward investment successes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
The inward investment successes are very relevant to this description of the Welsh economy. We are pleased about LG arriving in Wales. We hope that construction will start in Newport within the next month or two. We are pleased, too, that on the LG front the announcement was made last night that Dr. Jones, who personally almost managed to stop LG coming to Wales by leaking it prematurely to the BBC, has been terminated. I welcome the efforts made by the Secretary of State for Wales to veto his reappointment because of that irresponsible act. I commend him for his guts in standing up to other Cabinet Ministers who appeared to want to reappoint Dr. Jones. He might have lost the LG investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the LG investment has considerable consequences for the Red Book—the Welsh Office spend—because it is £180 million in grants from different sources; from the Welsh Development Agency, which will have to spend £70 million, and the Welsh Office which, through the regional selective assistance, will also have to spend £70 million. The training and enterprise councils will also have to spend. It is a significant sum in terms of the Red Book and the Welsh Office's cash flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the President of Plaid Cymru on one point. The lack of information with which we are being asked to debate the state of the Red Book, the Welsh economy and NHS expenditure in Wales today is very sad. We do not have the papers in front of us that would enable us to have a full debate on the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me mention two significant factors. We were told by the Welsh Development Agency that it understood that all the expenditure on LG by the WDA and the Welsh Office would be coming out of a special Treasury allocation which would be additional to previously expressed spending plans. That is what it understood—that there was to be extra money for the WDA. It was not going to affect the rest of the WDA budget. Presumably the same would apply to any Welsh Office direct departmental expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be clear to us today that when there is big, lumpy expenditure like that—£78 million or whatever it will be in the next financial year—the details should be available to us today so that we know whether that is some extra expenditure. We could then work out whether the other expenditure is being sacrificed because of the large sum of money that we have to spend to help LG to get its two factories going. Otherwise, something else may have to give because LG is coming in. It will be of such enormous benefit to the UK in terms of exports that the Treasury is willing to pay for it in effect. That is very significant, and I wish that the Secretary of State had provided us with the papers on that sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same difficulty applies to the proceedings of this Committee in relation to the BSE crisis. The Red Book figures for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are perfectly clear. There is a separate line given in the control totals for this year's out-turn for next year's plans, and even for 1998. The BSE expenditure is being treated as a separate item—in fact, it is about one-third of the budget of the Ministry. We do not know whether the BSE expenditure in Wales is covered by that Ministry line or whether it is Welsh Office
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
expenditure. If it is Welsh Office expenditure, is that the increase above plans that the Secretary of State was talking about earlier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis that we have 10 per cent. of the cattle, perhaps, at a very rough approximation, we will have 10 per cent. of the BSE outbreak. If Government are to spend money next year out of a special allocation, given the separate line in the Red Book for England of £770 million, is there a special allocation for BSE taken out of the contingency reserve of £70 million for Wales, or is that part of the total sum which is all hidden within the block?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the trouble which we are faced with and when we have a territorial Minister or Secretary of State like the present Secretary of State. He can hide a great deal within the departmental block. He does not necessarily have to tell those of us who have to discuss the contents of the Budget what his spending plans are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the health service. We know what the spending plans in England are for the Department of Health for both this year and next year, but we do not know what the Welsh Office spending plans are for 1997–98. The Secretary of State says to us that he will tell us next week, but, of course, in England they have known this for a week, since the Budget. We are a bit late, therefore, with the figures. I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman chooses to part the curtain a little bit today and is then going to part it a little bit more tomorrow. But he is always parting it behind his opposite numbers in England rather than ahead of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, would we not say that great flexibility is given to a Secretary of State for Wales? He has the block. He can change money round from one category to another. We can get our arms round the country of Wales because it is only a small country. Great. In that case, he should be able to provide more information not less information than the Department of Health or the Ministry, as is actually happening. That is the difficulty which we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then have the business of the consequence of what is in the Red Book for council tax levels next year. The Secretary of State skirted round that and said that he thought that local authorities would be able to manage with a rise in council tax next year that might be, if I understood him correctly, above retail price index inflation, but should not be as high as last year and should be no higher than in England. Well, I do not know what that is supposed to mean to the ordinary band D council tax payer in consequence. Is he talking about an average of 10 per cent. or 5 per cent. or 15 per cent. or what? To be honest, I think he might try to be a little bit more direct, because he was far more direct in his letter to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) in November last year. He gave then specific figures of the indicative levels of council tax increases that he expected would be the consequence of his Budget measures and the general expectation that he would be shifting more of the burden from the national taxpayer to the council taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
That policy of shifting more of the burden on the council taxpayer should be explained to us. Does it mean that the right hon. Gentleman is going to cut the Welsh Office expenditure directly, load more of it on to the councils in areas such as care in the community and so on, and expect them to raise a bigger share of it through the council tax rather than through income tax, VAT and all the other centrally gathered and distributed resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Welsh Grand Committee a week after the Budget, we deserve a little more of an indication than "not higher than England", only a bit higher than RPI, or a little bit less than last year, when councils still had to face unravelling the costs of local government reorganisation as well. Is what the Secretary of State said in his revealing letter last year to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon still true? The Secretary of State referred to a transfer of the burden. How much of the burden is to be transferred and how much of an effect will there therefore be when April comes round? People will receive a reduction in income tax—headline rate—in their first pay packet at the end of April, but they will also receive their rate demand from their council. If they take the two together, they will find that they are no better off than they were before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our fear, particularly in Wales and particularly in light of the Secretary of State's letter to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon 13 months ago. We deserve better from the Secretary of State today—a little more frankness, a few more papers, a few more figures and more material on which to assess whether the Budget is good for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like something more on BSE—something more about the special deals with the Treasury. The Secretary of State keeps asking us what we would do if and when we came to office. We do not know about those deals with the Treasury. Are there special deals on BSE? Are there special deals on how to fund LG development without stopping the Welsh Development Agency from doing almost everything else? We do not know until we see the books and that causes us many difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even on the health service it causes us enormous difficulties. We know what the Department of Health proposes to spend, but not what the Secretary of State proposes to spend. We know the track record—there are 3,000 fewer nurses in Wales than there were before the national health service reforms and the number of managers has increased from 450 to 1,450 in those five years. We know what the Government's priorities have been—put the resources into bureaucracy and not into patient care. But until we have a chance to change the system by which the national health service is run in Wales, it is difficult for us to estimate. All we know is that our priorities would be patient care and not bureaucracy. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I can hear siren voices from the parliamentary private secretary. If one takes the average expenditure rise year on year, after taking into account input price inflation, both in Wales and throughout the United kingdom, the annual average increase after NHS inflation was higher during the last Labour Government than it has been during the 17 years of Conservative Government.

I heard the remarkable speech of the right hon. Member for Conwy, who blamed the Welsh Office Ministers in the last Labour Government for the pipe having been put in wrongly in Ysbyty Gwynedd, in spite of the fact that the designers of the hospital, W. S. Atkins, paid £5.9 million in compensation in 1988. The right hon. Gentleman was making a wrong claim there, just as his ministerial colleagues tend to do now. But if we had that money back from the designers, it certainly cannot have been the fault of Labour Ministers, can it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people regard the Budget as being, to use a "Wenglish" word, a wit wat Budget from a wit wat Government—that is, neither one thing nor the other, for the benefit of those who are not familiar with Wenglish. It takes with one hand and gives back with the other. The people of Wales are not fooled. They are not wit wat in Wales, they have made up their minds what they will do at the next election. They are looking to produce a Tory-free zone in Wales, as has occurred once or twice—we expect it to occur again. That is what the people of Wales will be hoping and working for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have nothing to gain from any continuation of the present Government. Indeed, we have everything to gain from the expectation that we will have a Labour Government, who will cease to use ineffective talking shops and replace them with the tools to do the job on a democratic and accountable basis. They will no longer depend on Welsh European forums, Welsh economic forums and Welsh Grand Committees, which can do nothing. A Welsh Assembly will make a difference by delivering to the people of Wales what the people of Wales vote for and want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) spoke, I thought it unfair of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) to call this Committee sitting a farce. I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West will keep on talking about Tory-free zones. The electorate will react in completely the opposite way because it reveals the Labour party for exactly what it is. We have all heard about bad losers, but if the Labour party won the election, it would be a bad winner. That adherence to a Tory-free zone brings it home entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to describe this sitting of the Committee as being a rare privilege, as we heard three swan songs: from the hon. Member for Gower; from the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery; and possibly from my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy. If left-wing parties want to identify themselves with a Tory-free zone, I am sure the electorate will take note of that as well. Sittings of this Committee, especially if there were a Labour Government, would become even more rare. We heard that from the hon. Member for Caerphilly today. He said that if this Committee did not meet again for another year, it would not be too soon for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament has instituted changes to this Committee to make it more meaningful and to include the opportunity for Question Time and short debates. It was a fitting exit for the hon. Member for Gower that he gently needled his Front Bench on that very point.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
Changes have been made to make the Committee more meaningful and to give Back Benchers more opportunity to question the Government. What is the hon. Member for Caerphilly frightened of? We know that he is not good at framing the right questions. He is certainly no good at coming up with the answers, as he has proved today, but he appears to be safe in what he has done to frustrate the rights of Back Benchers, representing the supine Back Benchers as he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong for the hon. Member for Cardiff, West to complain about the date of today's sitting and say that hon. Members did not have the papers before them. The arrangements were made through the usual channels. It is the hon. Member for Caerphilly to whom he should talk. I remind him of our offer of three more meetings of this Committee, for two of which the Labour party can choose the subject. It is the Labour party that has frustrated discussion of Welsh affairs.

and, most obviously, across Anglesey through our commitment to proceed with the dualling of the A55 at the earliest opportunity. We want to maintain the gains that we have already made. We want to have the foundations for prosperity for five years and beyond—unless a Labour Government should ruin it.

We know that good economics is good politics. The Labour party does not. It thinks that gimmicks, standing on its head and saying anything will get it elected. It makes the same old spurious claims. Labour has never been trusted on tax and certainly will not be trusted on tax in the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to continue working with millions of hardworking men and women to build the future, a lasting prosperity for five years and beyond. The Conservative Government are the Government of the working class, the hard-working class.

As promised, there will be more income after the Budget. Next year, the average family will have £1,100 more spending money after tax and inflation than at the last election. That is £20 a week more. Tax cuts and growth in the economy will mean that the average family will be £370 better off next year after all taxes and inflation. By next year, a family on average earnings will be £100 a week better off since 1979, after tax and inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that of that £20, £15 is projections for the next two years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making projections that are fairly set out and based on the calculations that anyone can see. I thought for a moment that the hon. Gentleman was about to fall into the trap of trying to make the claim about 22 Tory tax increases. I have the list here and would have read out the 22 tax increases that I have heard his hon. Friends make. I have a list here and shall read out the 22 Tory tax cuts since the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be prosperity after the Budget. We shall have a 23p basic rate of income tax from next April, the lowest basic rate for 60 years. As the hon. Member for Caernarfon reminded us, it is lop down on the rate that we inherited from the previous Labour Government. We intend to take it down to 20p in the pound.

The economy has grown faster than any other major European economy since 1992. Both the Organisations for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund predict that we shall top the European premier league for growth again in 1996 and 1997. We forecast 2.5 per cent. growth in 1996 and 3.5 per cent. in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment has come down by almost 1 million since 1992 and is set to fall to beneath 2 million. Unemployment in Wales is now down to below 100,000. I was pleased to note that in the past year, my constituency of Cardiff, North has seen the greatest drop in unemployment—23.3 per cent. I do not know whether I can claim that it is due to the dynamic leadership in Cardiff, North, but I am pleased to note that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
I was equally pleased to note the progress we have made in reducing unemployment in the valleys. Since the first programme for the valleys was launched, unemployment there has fallen by 28.6 per cent. compared with a fall in Wales as a whole of 19.4 per cent. We have had the longest run of low inflation for 50 years. It is safeguarding savings and helping businesses to invest. We are on course to meet our 2.5 per cent. inflation target and borrowing is forecast to fall to £19 billion next year and a balance by the end of the decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our priorities are jobs, education and health. May I add fighting crime to that? The Government had to take over the setting of police funding from 1 April 1995. I remind the Committee of that, because on more than one occasion Opposition Members have referred to the element for police funding. I know the example of the South Wales police. Funding for the South Wales police since 1 April 1995 has gone up by 20 per cent. It has had to go up by 20 per cent. to combat the way in which the Labour county councils starved the police of money when it was their responsibility. Police funding is now on a much better basis and is a classic example of the difference between what Labour say they will do and what they will do if they are given the chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For we humble seekers of the truth—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—Let me pose a question. What visions, aims and aspirations—let alone policies—have we heard from Opposition Members today? I can fairly categorise them as silence, waffle and evasion. There were one or two exceptions, and I must acknowledge the hon. Member for Ynys Môn, echoed by the hon. Member for Caernarfon, who sought to make positive contributions about what they would do if they were setting either a United Kingdom Budget or a budget for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of humble seeking after truth, out of respect for the Committee, is the Minister going to tell us whether there is special cover for the BSE crisis in next year's projections in the Red Book that were in the Welsh Office press release about which we have been arguing and, if so, how much it is and does it come from a special reserve figure? I can see that he is perhaps being reminded of it by the Secretary of State. Perhaps that is one thing that the Secretary of State does know about which his junior Minister does not. Also, could he say something about the LG deal and whether that is covered by a special allocation from the Treasury which has come in over and above previous published plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman well knows, those matters are rather too detailed and lengthy for the very short time I have left. I have given away some time by allowing every intervention so far. Certainly my right hon. Friend has ensured that there are appropriate provisions for both those examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to respond to the debate, I wish to refer back to particular matters that were raised. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, making one of his rare appearances here and perhaps the last appearance of the Liberal party in Wales, was concerned about ambulance provision in his constituency of Montgomery. I can tell him that the south and east Wales ambulance trust dispatches a two-person crew
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
including a paramedic to emergency calls whenever possible. A single-person crew is dispatched only when, because of an excessive number of call-outs, the quickest way to attend an incident is by dispatching a single-handed crew. I understand that that is standard practice throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman was also concerned about Charlies Stores Ltd. I understand that the company wanted to make an offer for units 1 and 2 on the Dyffryn industrial estate, but was subsequently informed that the Development Board for Rural Wales had decided to refurbish the units for modern manufacturing purposes rather than sell them to other potential users. However, I understand that the board continues to offer assistance to the company in finding suitable alternative accommodation in mid Wales and several options have been discussed with the company's managing director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly had a positive debate with the contributions from my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy and my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West and my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan. I am sure we were all very interested to know of the value he gave to the conversion criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy amused us when he related the press headline about "Wales puts its faith in Davies"—although he was very quick to point out that this did not relate to the hon. Member for Caerphilly. Various press cuttings have been quoted in the debate. I thought my right hon. Friend made the most telling point reminding us of the 	<i>Western Mail's</i> editorial which talked about the best Budget for Welsh business for a decade. That is very much more telling than the selecltive quotes, mainly from Mirror Group newspapers, that were advanced by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is also very telling to look through the 	<i>Western Mail</i> today. One would not have had to go far
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
before finding mentions of a feeling of optimism on the streets, the broadcasting revolution being the key to vast business opportunity, a technological leap giving viewers a choice and suggestions that Wales can be in the vanguard. Those are just four stories I picked out before I turned over to another page and found the headline about GPs saying that Labour's plans are bad for patients. That is very pertinent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy was naturally very concerned about the Benefits Agency's arrangements for Wales and I can reassure him that I and my officials will be in touch with the agency and will be emphasising the need to ensure continued easy access across Wales. I am sure that the Committee will welcome the fact that the Benefits Agency has extended the period of consultation on its proposals for rationalising its office in Wales. That will enable people to put their views forward and we thank the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security for doing exactly that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have not had the most positive debate from Opposition Members. I wonder whether that is because it is the hon. Member for Caerphilly's swan-song. It is not that I do not expect him to be re-elected, although I know that he does not have as strong a base in Caerphilly as I have in Cardiff, North. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] When he came to the House—on the same day that I did—he had a smaller share of the popular vote than I had. But I think that it is the rumour which was put around originally by Paul Linford of the 	<i>South Wales Echo</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
