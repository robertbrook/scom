Legislative Programme and Pre-Budget Statement</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech and the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Statement as they relate to Wales.—[<i>Mr. Paul Murphy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind right hon. and hon. Members that the Committee is debating the matter of the Government's legislative programme and the Chancellor's pre-Budget Statement as they relate to Wales. The Committee will note that we made progress this morning by ensuring that speeches were brief, but many still seek to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik<span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking about public transport. I had complained about transport policy for the whole of Wales, and in particular about train services. I hope that the bypasses that have been proposed for Llanymynech in my constituency and the one near Talgarth in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) will be approved, as they would substantially improve accessibility to Wales.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech mentioned some good things about education, especially with regard to special educational needs and access to learning for disabled people, but we would have liked to hear rather more about tackling the recruitment and retention of staff. Perhaps the Assembly can do a better job for Wales.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to the treacherous condition of some Home Office legislation. We have heard some fighting talk from the Home Secretary, but what is the benefit of putting young offenders back into the very homes that may have caused the offending behaviour? A more empathic approach needs to be taken than that proposed by the Home Office. It may take longer, but we can learn a lot from such effective organisations as Fairbridge and Youth at Risk, who seek to resolve the underlying causes rather than merely to suppress the symptoms through curfews and other authoritarian actions.<br><br>
I want to talk about the style of government. It seems to me that Wales continues to have the opportunity to make a different kind of politics work. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) was uncharacteristically critical of the nature of government, although the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) seemed to suggest that Plaid Cymru had accepted that the experimental partnership
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
between Labour and the Liberal Democrats may be made to work. Of course, the test will be the extent to which we can change policy—whether we can improve the rural settlement, and whether other preventative health measures such as free school milk can be introduced.<br><br>
We evaluate ourselves in the House through debate, but the public evaluate us by the result. I hope that the Government will listen genuinely to views, whether from their own party or from elsewhere. Wales tends to be quite good at fighting for itself, but it is now time for us to help Wales to fight its corner. I hope that we will all do all that we can to get the most for Wales from the Queen's Speech.</span></p>
<p>4.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I welcome the measures in the pre-Budget report, particularly the duty-free fuel and the rise in pensions, I shall focus on the legislative programme.<br><br>
The hunting Bill is a controversial measure, but I believe that most people want hunting banned. At the general election, we promised a free vote on hunting. That took place, but most people believed that it was a promise to ban hunting, which we have not yet done. I shall vote to ban hunting, but an outright ban will bring real problems. I am pleased to see that the Bill has taken account of some of those problems, particularly in the exceptions for flushing out with dogs.<br><br>
In Wales—I am not sure about the rest of the United Kingdom—there are two sorts of packs. There are the "Yoiks, tally-ho" packs, with hunting pink and horses, which tear one fox to bits in an afternoon. Most farmers in Wales want more foxes controlled than that, and tend to control them themselves with foot packs. In the Berwyn in my constituency, a group of like-minded people go out with dogs, flush the foxes on to guns and then shoot them humanely. I understand that that is taken into account in part II of schedule 3. I am sure that the ban will find favour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman assure me that he will listen to the arguments for all the options when the time comes? It would be most dangerous for us to be ruled by an emotive argument, and to be closed to arguments different from those currently preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the arguments for about 20 years. The same arguments took place when Clwyd county council tried to impose a ban.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a widespread and long debate on the abolition of fox hunting. Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that enormous sums of compensation will have to be paid to those directly employed in hunting if abolition goes ahead? The costs could run into millions. Would he prefer millions of pounds to be spent on banning fox hunting or on the national health service in Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman finds his information. Perhaps he would tell me, because, judging from the parts of the Bill that I had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
read, I had no idea that there was any element of compensation. It would be a strange precedent to have compensation for something criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he would give no compensation whatever to anyone who worked in fox hunting and lost his job as a direct result of the Government's legislation to ban the sport?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the employees would be eligible for normal redundancy pay. In the House, we can legislate for what we collectively like, without any compensation, unless we decide otherwise. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should table an amendment to that effect to the Bill, but I doubt that it would find much favour among those who will vote on it. I do not remember those who lost their jobs in steel works receiving much compensation from the previous Government.<br><br>
I want to move on to other subjects, especially the Children's Commissioner for Wales and the proposals in the police and criminal justice Bill. I am pleased that the Government have demonstrated their high priorities for the care and protection of young people in Wales by including the Bill to extend the Children's Commissioner's functions in the Queen's Speech. The Waterhouse report was published only 10 months ago, so that is a tribute to Ministers who have acted quickly to implement the key findings of "Lost in Care".<br><br>
Hon. Members will recall that I was a little dubious about the drafting of the Waterhouse report, especially in terms of its naming or not naming individuals accused by victims of abuse. If I had found that those not named had not been properly investigated, I would have named them in the House, but in three hours of going through evidence with police, it was clear that the people whose names I had been given as alleged abusers, but who were not named in the report, were probably not prosecutable, whether guilty or not. That still does not absolve the drafting of the report, because those people should have been named. It should have been made clear that they were not guilty and it should not have been left to a third party such as me to go through the evidence.<br><br>
However, as I said at the time, the recommendations of the Waterhouse report were good. More than 70 of them made a contribution to the safety of children in care, and one of those was the creation of the post of Children's Commissioner. Confidence in the protection of children in care was severely undermined following the crimes that took place in north Wales. It is pleasing that children had a role in the appointment of Mr. Clarke. He will have a pivotal role in restoring confidence for future generations of young children, and I wish him well in his task.<br><br>
I am delighted that the Bill also seeks to address some of the minor deficiencies of the Care Standards Act 2000 by extending the role of the Children's Commissioner. Most of us thought that that was necessary, so I am pleased that the new commissioner will not only concentrate on the 3,000 young people in care in Wales but act as a promoter of the rights of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
every child in Wales. The commissioner's role in overseeing complaints procedures, his powers to undertake formal investigations on matters of principle and his role in observing child abuse investigations mean that we now have a basis for a rapid improvement in the protection of children in Wales.<br><br>
Irrespective of whether hon. Members represent rural or urban parts of Wales, crime and the fear of crime are high on the agenda of many of our constituents, so I am pleased that the Government are proposing measures to deal with what has been described as yob culture. Loutish behaviour affects most towns and villages in Wales, so the introduction of fixed penalties for offences of disorderly behaviour in public, including the use of insulting words and behaviour, is especially welcome. The intimidation felt in our streets has a big effect on people's perception of their own safety, particularly among the elderly.<br><br>
The new police powers to close down licensed premises immediately in order to deal with disorderly behaviour are also welcome. Prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in designated public places will be welcome in some villages in my constituency, and enabling local authorities to take an active role in imposing bans on street drinking is an excellent proposal. Those measures are not hard-line or draconian, they are common-sense, practical measures designed to help the police to do their job. They are designed to redress the imbalance that has developed over the past 20 years and restore a sense of community and of responsibility to one's community. The planned legislation referred to in the Queen's Speech goes some way towards that.<br><br>
Not only are the Government introducing legislation to deal with the problems that daily fill our postbags: they are prepared to put their money where their mouth is on crime. The recent settlement for North Wales police is a prime example. For the next financial year, North Wales police are set to receive an increase in funding of 6.1 per cent., or £4.7 million. North Wales police will receive additional funding to reduce crime and the fear of crime in rural Wales through targeted initiatives such as the crime fighting fund and the rural policing fund. That is especially welcome in rural areas such as my constituency.<br><br>
The Government can rightly be proud of their record in north Wales. They have proved that the pledges that they made before the general election were not just empty rhetoric. It ill behoves the Conservative party to run down and disparage the benefits that the Government have brought to the people of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his brief speech.</span></p>
<p>4.14 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans<span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall endeavour to limit my speech to 10 minutes. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear".] Perhaps I should start off with "And in conclusion." First, I apologise to the Secretary of State for Wales, as I was not here earlier. I also travelled by public transport this morning, on an aeroplane from New York. [HON. MEMBERS:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
"Ah."] Yes, the land of the free, but not the land of the president-elect as yet. It is still early days. It has only been a month.<br><br>
I have been told what the Secretary of State said and I want to concentrate mostly on the autumn statement as my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) dealt with the Queen's Speech and the Children's Commissioner. We all wish Peter Clarke well in his new appointment. It is an important job and we wish him well.<br><br>
The Government and their supporters—I point here to the Liberal Democrats—are rather complacent about the booming Welsh economy. Yes, certainly some areas of Wales are doing well: in parts of Cardiff and Swansea, advances have been made, but an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today refers to a survey by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Under the headline "More people 'living in poverty under Labour'", it says:
<br><blockquote><p>In 1998–99, there were 14.25 million people in households with less than half average income….This is more than double the number of the early 1980s and half a million greater than the previous high point in 1992–93. The numbers with less than 40 per cent of average income have also grown.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane<span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will in a moment. This Government were elected on the slogan that things can only get better. What will the hon. Gentleman say to the half a million more people living in poverty in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not here when I intervened on the same point when it was mentioned by the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones). If he reads on he will see that the statistics only go up to 1999 and do not include the new deal, the working families tax credit or the minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not call that much of an apology. That comes from a Government who say that they listen, but when the people of Wales cry out that they want a tick box on the census, they ignore them completely. They are ignoring the plight of people who have become more disadvantaged under this Government in only three and a half years. One need look no further than the M4 corridor to see job losses running into thousands over the past six to nine months, with the prospect of losing thousands more in manufacturing. There is concern that there will be an enormous ripple effect throughout Wales. I hope that Labour Members will take that seriously. The Queen's Speech and the autumn statement were a dreadful lost opportunity to help Wales to survive some of the real problems of lost jobs in manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths<span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the hon. Gentleman that we all accept that there are ups and downs in jobs in various industries, but since we have been in power, the number of jobs in Wales has increased? What record does he have on protesting about the huge job cuts in the steel industry when the Tory Government were in power and more jobs were lost than from any other industry in Wales?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, there appears to be a lack of listening on the Government side. They say that there does not seem to be a problem and that, yes, there are ups and downs. If thousands more jobs losses are announced over the next few days, will the Government respond that those are ups and downs? The headline in the <i>South Wales Echo</i> on 15 November was "Wales sees a rise in unemployment". That was the point that I made to the Minister at Welsh Questions when I was told that there was no rise in unemployment for that month. Indeed, there was a rise. We must take this seriously. We need to establish how we can help to alleviate the problem, particularly for major industries such as the steel industry and, indeed, the new industries that are shedding jobs by the thousand in the south Wales corridor.<br><br>
I was a bit bemused by the Plaid Cymru approach outlined this morning, which seemed to be to cut tax on diesel, lower corporation tax levies in objective 1 areas and increase the threshold below which people pay no income tax to £7,000. While that is a tremendous wish list, I was struck by the lack of any costing for the project. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon mentioned those three matters specifically. I do not say that those tax changes would not be of any help, but I would like to know who would pay for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd<span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was here when my right hon. Friend spoke, and he mentioned something about a threshold of £7,000 in connection with what is happening in Ireland. The hon. Gentleman is not famous for listening or for comprehension, so perhaps he should be a little more careful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is better at reading than he is at hearing, then, because when he sees the <i>Hansard</i> report of the sitting, he will see that those three areas of taxation were specified by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon as needing to be tackled by the Government. He wanted to know why that was not happening.<br><br>
In a debate in Westminster Hall the other day, I told hon. Members that I had spoken with several employers' representatives, including the Federation of Small Businesses. They were concerned about the supplementary business rate that could soon be introduced by local authorities in Wales, which could, over five years, add another 5 per cent, to the business rates of small employers. I ask the Government to think again about that. Are they really prepared to give to local authorities a power that would hamper some of the smallest businesses in Wales, which are working on the margins where profits are very tight? Those smaller businesses helped to create jobs in the 1980s and they will again help to create hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the country, but particularly in Wales. I ask the Secretary of State to use his influence with other Ministers to prevent the imposition, through the back door, of that stealth tax on businesses in Wales.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
The climate change levy is another measure that will have an enormous, and in some sectors disproportionate, influence in Wales, because of our reliance on manufacturing. That will mean that yet again jobs will be exported from Wales, but not to England. They will go to the Czech Republic, Poland and other east European countries.<br><br>
On a day when Nice is being discussed throughout the House of Commons, the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) spoke of farming, with a total lack of sympathy. I can only assume that he is not speaking for the Government when he speaks of removing all subsidies from farming unless it has no environmental impact at all. He seems to have no sympathy for farmers in Wales in the worst farming crisis for 60 years. Why was not the Nice summit used as an opportunity to consider reform of the common agricultural policy? Deep reform could be undertaken, which would help farmers in this country and elsewhere in Europe. Farmers in France and Germany, in particular, will now be suffering because of BSE. However, yet again the door is being opened to other countries to join the European Union. We shall have a real problem in Europe and our farmers will have even worse problems than now, unless we get to grips with common agricultural policy reform.<br><br>
There is of course still a big question mark over joining the euro. Several hon. Members joined me today in meeting representatives of the gaming industry, some of whom came from Wales. We discussed preparations for joining the euro, which will cost the industry hundreds of millions of pounds—just in case. We know from the Labour-dominated Trade and Industry Committee that it will cost well over £30 billion for industry to prepare for joining the single currency. When will the Government have the guts to call the referendum on the single currency? Businesses are being put to enormous cost. Businesses in Wales are looking to the Government for some answers but are being given none.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves on, I am sure that he would not want to mislead the Grand Committee. He would want to make it clear that the British Amusement Catering Trades Association, with which we dined at lunchtime, has an open mind on the euro's introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: BACTA does not take a position on joining or not joining the euro; it is up to the Government to take a position and explain it, but we hear nothing from them whatever. They are not a lobby organisation like BACTA, which represents many of its members. We are talking about the Government of the day and we expect them to have answers to these questions. One major question facing the country this century is whether we join the European single currency. I hope that the Secretary of State or the Minister can give us some answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only 60 seconds left, so I cannot take any more interventions, much as I would like to do so. I want to mention one aspect of the objective 1 grants being made in Wales. A batch of those grants has been announced, and we shall be considering critically their impact in Wales. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) said that there was a logjam in the Welsh Assembly and that that was part of the problem with objective 1. The Assembly's priorities are amazing: Members are giving themselves new titles, new holidays and a new building. Is it not about time that they prioritised the people of Wales, rather than its politicians? I hope that they will listen to what the people of Wales are saying: they want people, industries and services to be put first, not politicians.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can explain to the Welsh people why the Government have prioritised fox hunting. There will be a so-called free vote, but we know from the previous free vote in the House of Commons which way the matter is likely to go. Why will we spend so much time debating fox hunting when there are so many more important issues—including the national health service, education and law and order—to be dealt with in Wales? The Government's action will create a new criminal society in Wales, which will add to the costs of law and order.<br><br>
It has been said that the Queen's Speech was a cut-and-run speech and the Government are ready to call an early general election. As far as I am concerned, the earlier, the better. With the support that the Government receive from the Liberal Democrats in the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and at Westminster, the Tweedledumbs and Tweedledumbers of politics are working together for one end.<br><br>
A suggestion has been made, and I should like to issue the Secretary of State for Wales with a challenge. The Conservative party is keen on, and has accepted in principle, the challenge of debates between all the major political parties. We hope that they will take place in Wales. We have said yes, because we are proud of what our party has to offer the people of Wales and we have grave concerns about what the Government have done to the people and services of Wales in the past three and a half years. Constitutionally, economically and in other ways, Wales cannot afford another three and a half to four years of the Labour Government. I hope that the Secretary of State will accept that challenge. We look forward to the election and the fight. I am absolutely certain that the Conservative party will gain many seats throughout Wales at the election.</span></p>

Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) is leaving. I watched the Plaid Cymru political broadcast on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley<span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was it good?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am leaving to take part in the forthcoming debate in the Chamber. In any event, I have heard the hon. Gentleman before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is as witty as ever.<br><br>
To be serious, we are in danger of talking Wales down. I am referring particularly to Plaid Cymru's reaction. We expect knee-jerk right-wing reactions from the Conservatives, but Plaid Cymru is supposed to be the Party of Wales, and a left-wing party, in touch with its communities. I do not believe that it is in touch with what is happening in its communities. I do not recognise the Wales that I heard about in last Friday's party political broadcast and in today's debates. From beginning to end, Plaid Cymru was entirely negative. Over the past three and a half years, its Members of Parliament talked the Welsh economy down. They talked down the image and vision of Wales at a critical period in its history.<br><br>
Wales is the place to be. Cardiff is the youngest and fastest growing capital in Europe.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And Barry.<br><br>
Wales is the best place in Europe for inward investment. Wales now has the chance to brand, to believe and to rediscover itself. All we hear from Plaid Cymru is negative doom and gloom, pessimism and whingeing, all of which has a bad effect. I grant that this morning's speech by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon was, in comparison those of his hon. Friends, measured. It is a pity that he is no longer the leader of that party. [<i>Interruption.</i>] He would have had my vote.<br><br>
The negative whingeing of Plaid Cymru is having a profound effect on the public perception of the National Assembly for Wales—an institution that almost all of us cherished, fought for and had high hopes for. My constituents are not pleased with what has happened over the past couple of years because Plaid Cymru has not been consensual. We have had two years of negative nit-picking, which has damaged the public perception of Wales within Wales. We are losing instead of gaining confidence in ourselves. The public perception of Wales—in the UK and abroad— is, as I said, being damaged by the constant whingeing of Plaid Cymru.<br><br>
I repeat that I do not recognise the Wales that emerges from the speeches and party political broadcasts of Plaid Cymru. If the Welsh nationalists achieved their aim of independence and established embassies around the world, what would their ambassadors say? "Don't invest in Wales or visit Wales; it's a terrible place. We have nothing to trade, we're a backwater". That seems to be their message to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
the world—the same message that they proclaim in Wales. They are in extreme danger of talking Wales down at a critical point in its history.<br><br>
Wales has had, and will continue to have, problems. In my constituency, 800 jobs were lost at Kwiksave when the Welsh company lost its headquarters; 300 jobs went when the Conservatives closed down Point of Air pit; 1,000 jobs went at the North Wales hospital. Yes, we have had problems, but I am proud of the way in which my constituency is bouncing back. Under the Conservatives, we had 12 per cent, unemployed, but the figure is now down to 3.9 per cent.<br><br>
In 1987 I organised a march through the west ward of Rhyll, officially the most poverty-stricken ward in the whole of Wales. Lord Elis-Thomas was invited— in the interests of political balance—and addressed the meeting. At that time, the ward had 58 per cent, unemployment. In October, 480 jobs were announced by WTS in Prestatyn, 170 were announced by Hotpoint in Bodelwyddan, and 350 in Morrison's in Rhyll. I opened the first ever European investment establishment by TRB, a Japanese company, in the whole of Europe. It was located in St. Asaph in my constituency and provided 150 jobs. Denbighshire county council has announced a package for 1,000 jobs under objective 1.<br><br>
We have also heard the good news that British Aerospace, now that it has finally received £19 million from the National Assembly for Wales, is to create 2,000 jobs. That will have a positive impact not only in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon, but in every constituency in north Wales. There is good news out there: we must recognise and celebrate it, not do ourselves down all the time.<br><br>
We talk of vision. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon rightly stressed the importance for Wales of focusing on particular sectors. We already have an aerospace and aeronautical sector—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Optronics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Optronics will be the key sector in a central part of north Wales. I am working closely with the Welsh Optoelectronics Federation, which hopes to increase the number of skilled jobs in Wales from 2,500 to 7,500 in a seven-year period. It will become a world centre of excellence in optoelectronics. Pinnacle, in my constituency, has 25 per cent, of the United Kingdom's IT cabling market. I am proud of that. Up to 50 per cent, of the glass in satellites is made by Pilkington Space Technology in my constituency. I am proud of that, too. I know that there are problems, but we must keep things in perspective. If we look only at narrow political gains in this or that constituency and ignore the wider vision of Wales at this critical moment in our history, we shall be doing down the people of Wales.<br><br>
The Queen's speech and the pre-Budget statement have been welcomed, particularly by Plaid Cymru. I shall concentrate most of my fire on what the Conservative party did for pensioners, and contrast that with what we propose. The figure of 75p has been mentioned, but the increase was 65p in 1985, and it has been as low as 25p under the Conservatives. One
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
pensioner was so disgusted with her 65p pay rise that she sent a cheque for that amount to Mrs. Thatcher at 10 Downing street—and Mrs. Thatcher cashed it. That attitude betrays the person, the party and its philosophy.<br><br>
Some of those pensioners are still alive today, but 16,000 pensioners died in 1985 because of the cold weather. Of those, 1,000 froze to death in their own homes. A widow of 84 froze to death after suffering a slight stroke because she was unable to crawl back to the warmth of her bed or to call for help. A woman of 83 was so cold that, once she had been found by her neighbours, the doctors could not get a temperature reading. Police broke into the home of an 89-year-old man, whose temperature was found to be 17 degrees below normal when he was taken to hospital, and he died soon afterwards. Coroner John Budd said at the Blackpool inquest on Edith Davies, aged 83, that many old folk seem to be frightened to turn on the heating because of the high cost.<br><br>
What was the Government's advice in those cold years? It was that people should buy woolly jumpers from the second-hand shop and sit in one cold room. That was official Government policy. [Hon. Members: "Edwina."] The very same: Cruella Deville.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter<span class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say how many people have died of hypothermia during the past three and a half years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall put the question back to the hon. Gentleman. We have put measures in place to combat that. He should contrast the advice given to pensioners by Edwina Currie to buy second-hand woollens with our advice to spend the £200 that they will receive this week on fuel, such as electricity and gas. The Conservatives introduced such complicated rules. For instance, if the average temperature in a region went below minus 1.5 degrees over a seven-day period, the pensioners might qualify for £5 for the week. Those poor pensioners has one eye on the thermometer, one eye on their purses and another on the weather. They were too scared to turn on the heating and they froze to death in their thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why, then, when the late Audrey Wise and I introduced a private Member's Bill on the wind-chill factor, which would have meant payments to pensioners kicking in earlier, did the Labour Government ensure that that Bill went no further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives had 18 years to sort out that problem. We have come up with an answer; one of our first actions on being elected was to introduce a £20 cold weather payment, which has since increased by a factor of 10 to £200.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The £200 is a one-off payment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order to make sedentary remarks.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of cold weather payments is not the only one on which the Conservatives should be judged. What did they do with dental tests and eye tests? They charged for them, and pensioners in their thousands did not go to have their eyes or mouths checked. That did not mean simply that they went blind or had bad teeth; such tests could have revealed glaucoma and oral cancer. Consequently, many thousands of pensioners suffered with those diseases.<br><br>
The mis-selling of pensions in the private sector is another issue. Everyone was opposed to bureaucracy and red tape, but the Conservatives took those things away, and what happened? Millions of private pensions, were mis-sold, at a cost of billions of pounds. It was revealed last week that the SERPS fiasco inherited from the Tories started in 1986, and we shall now have to spend £12 billion to bail them out because of that decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They should be surcharged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, just as they surcharged London councillors.<br><br>
The Tories say that they want to match Labour's policy on pensions. Now that we are coming up to the election, they are saying that they will match like for like and ensure that people receive the same. They had 18 years in which to do that, and they did not do it. Let us contrast that with Labour's record. Under Labour, we have an insulation programme. The Tories had an insulation programme in the cold winter of 1985, but the following year, it was abolished. It was for the poorest pensioners. Those who had less than £500 in savings could apply for it. My own 76-year-old mother was lucky enough to receive it. However, the following year it was abolished.<br><br>
Let us consider the cold weather payment—£200 for every pensioner household in the country. Pensioners need not fear turning on their gas or electricity to keep warm this Christmas. We have given free television licences to the over-75s, and the minimum income guarantee is critical in ensuring that our pensioners do not experience the poverty that they experienced under the Conservatives. I have already mentioned my mother. In 1997, she was on the lowest income possible—£68 a week. Next year she will be on £92; the following year, £100. That makes a real difference to a pensioner. It is a massive rise, and pensioners in my constituency appreciate it.<br><br>
I was with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales in Denbigh last Thursday, in Bryn Seion, and the pensioners there were grateful for what we have done. They said, "Thank you, Christmas has come early because of that £200 cold weather payment, and we are thankful for free TV licences." I do not believe that that is enough. I was embarrassed by their gratitude. They deserve more. Many of them fought, or brought up families, in the war. My constituents on council estates and in sheltered accommodation know what they will receive if the Conservatives get in next year. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Increases like that in 1986? Any help will be abolished, and any replacements will not match what Labour has proposed—and they will be taxed.<br><br>

We are doing an excellent job on the two issues of reviving the Welsh economy and treating pensioners in Wales fairly. They are under direct threat from Plaid Cymru, with its negative attitude to the Welsh economy and its talking Wales down, and from the Conservatives, with their measly and niggardly attitude towards pensioners in Wales. Let us be careful. We have been warned.</span></p>
<p>4.43 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The barefaced effrontery that we hear from supporters of the previous Government never ceases to amaze me. They need to be reminded of their legacy. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley would admit that Baroness Thatcher is one of his great political heroines, but let us briefly consider what happened in Wales and one or two key and stark statistics of the care and concern that the Conservative Government supposedly had for Wales.<br><br>
In 1980, claimant count unemployment in Wales was slightly more than 84,000. By 1988, it had increased to nearly 124,000. It started to come down, but when Baroness Thatcher left office, unemployment was several thousand higher than when she came to office. We shall take no lectures from the Conservative party about the fact that some industries are experiencing difficult times. We must examine the Labour record this time around, which is about more people in work, employment increasing and unemployment coming down. When we face the electorate, whether it be in May or June next year, or even as late as May 2002, we can be happy. We can point to a Wales that has recovered. We should remember that every day of the week.<br><br>
We must also remember that this Labour Government, unlike most in the past, have learned some lessons about the way in which Labour Governments governed in the past. Unfortunately, Labour Administrations have tended to view government as a sprint, in which they have to do as much as possible as quickly as possible for the people who have suffered in Tory years. This time, we can see that after the marathon 18-year Tory disaster, a marathon 18-year or more Labour success is needed. We are pacing ourselves very carefully.<br><br>
I am sure that everybody in the Committee knows, whatever pastimes or sports they may have indulged in, that when one moves from one arena to another— from the first division to the premier league—one wonders how well one will do. To achieve success, the right level must be found. In the three and a half years of this Labour Government we have found that level. We have not rushed things: we have developed them. We took a lot of criticism for promising not to make any major alteration to the spending plans of the previous Government in the first two years. When one looks at the record, however, we did tweak things a little to get some more money into health, for example—more than £12 million in the first year and more than £99 million in the second year. We managed to get some extra money in, but not to the point at which the economy would be endangered.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
As the Tories often used to preach, the important point is that nothing can be done unless the economy is strong. We now have a strong and stable economy, and we can see the difference that that is making in Wales. For example, there is the money that has been and will be transferred to Wales under the Barnett formula. In year one, under Tory spending plans, the amount went up by only 0.4 per cent., but in the second year it went up by 2.7 per cent., just above inflation. In the third year, the figure was 8.2 per cent., well above inflation. In 2000–01, the current year, it is more than 6 per cent., again well above inflation. For the next financial year, it is planned to be 10 per cent.; the following year, 8.2 per cent.; and the year after that, 7.1 per cent. Given our record on inflation, we know that, every year, the amount coming to Wales will be two to three times more than the rate of inflation. That money will go into improving services in Wales.<br><br>
We can be confident—both this side of the election and the next—that the Welsh economy will grow and more people will find jobs, although we must admit that there are some parts of Wales where that is much more difficult. Objective 1 status has been achieved to enable us to tackle problems in those difficult areas. We cannot give any credence to any criticism from Conservative Members.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have already mentioned the significant, history-making Children's Commissioner for Wales and the speed with which the Government have shown how the devolution settlement is working. Some people might have liked rather more than we received, but it is working. There was and is a quick response. We will have a Children's Commissioner for Wales of whom, I am sure, we will be proud. I am sure that Peter Clarke will make a good job of it. When the Bill is presented to Parliament, that will be the time to debate fully how the post will operate.<br><br>
The Bill on special educational needs and disability is another critical measure. Some advances were made in the Tory years, and although there were some difficulties, a code of practice was set up. We supported the Government in that respect and appreciated the need for clear guidelines on how help would be provided. I am confident that the Bill will deal with the remaining problems, but I accept that the then Government took a significant step forward when they established the special needs tribunal.<br><br>
Unfortunately, because of disputes about whether the money for special needs under the formula will go to schools, whether it will be the responsibility of the local authority and whether it will apply in stage three and four, parents still have tremendous battles to obtain the help that they need. I hope that the new Bill will ensure that parents of children with special needs in the United Kingdom will receive that support.<br><br>
Let us consider the criminal justice Bill. Although the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy implied that it was part of an English agenda, it is not. It is part of an England and Wales agenda. All of us can think of a few places in our constituencies through which our constituents do not feel safe walking at night and where special measures are required. The Bill will help to solve some of those problems. Extra police will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
be on the beat. In my area, the South Wales police are using the new resources in the most effective and efficient way possible, not just putting a few people here and there but focusing on the problem areas. I look forward to matters improving, not worsening as they did under the Tories, when crime doubled but the number of convictions dropped by a third. The chances of being a victim of violent crime trebled and the chances of being a victim of burglary more than doubled. The Bill will help us to tackle that legacy.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to vote on hunting. I certainly hope that we shall get rid of it in Wales. The measures concerning homes are important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry for intervening each time hunting is mentioned, but will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that a significant proportion of the rural world believes that it is a matter not of whether we kill foxes, but of how we can do it most efficiently?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is an issue about how foxes are killed, but I am confident that the least efficient way is by hunting on horses with hounds.<br><br>
I look forward to the national health service plan being implemented in Wales in the most efficient manner possible. There are savings to be made and I am confident that, under the Government, in partnership with the National Assembly for Wales, we will see a steady improvement in our public services and the prosperity of our people, and that is thanks to the way in which the Labour party has managed the economy and provided additional funding for public services.</span></p>
<p>4.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan<span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State and the First Minister on the negotiations that have produced the first Wales-only Bill, which introduces the Children's Commissioner. It is a tremendously significant step forward, not only for the children of Wales but for devolution. It shows that the devolution settlement is working, and that it is a great achievement.<br><br>
I am disappointed by some of the comments coming from the Opposition. The Conservatives have totally failed to understand the nature of the post, and seem to believe that safeguarding children's interests is undermining family life, which is a complete misinterpretation of the commissioner's role. I am also disappointed by the slightly muted response of the hon. Member for Ceredigion, who has supported the cause. He could have been a little more enthusiastic and not as critical of the two-stage approach used by the Government, which enabled an appointment to be made quickly. By using as wide an amendment to the care standards legislation as possible, the Government were able to respond quickly to the Waterhouse report. Consequently, the commissioner's powers will be extended to other areas such as education and health soon after he takes up his post. I look forward to the publication of the Bill. The Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
pragmatic approach has paid off, so it is disappointing that the response from Opposition Members is not more enthusiastic.<br><br>
Devolution is at an early stage: it is only 16 months since the powers were transferred. The inclusion of a Wales-only Bill is a signal that the process is working. The National Assembly wanted a commissioner, and Wales will have one, while England will not. We are the envy of many of the child care charities in England, because the voluntary sector has campaigned for a commissioner for many years. I am sure that many hon. Members will have seen the manifesto produced by the child care charities—Barnardos, the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—called "Our Children, Their Future". It lists five demands, the first of which is for commissioners in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, who will be powerful independent champions for all the UK's children. It refers to the National Assembly for Wales being in the process of establishing a commissioner as recommended by the Waterhouse inquiry, and states that the rest of the UK should be brought into line. Wales is leading the way, and the post of commissioner should be given unreserved support. It is a great achievement, on which the Secretary of State and the First Minister should be congratulated. It required delicate negotiations, in which the Secretary of State is experienced, and his skill is reflected in the successful outcome in the Queen's Speech.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) mentioned the unique appointment procedure for the commissioner, in which young people play a full role. I am certain that it is the first time that young people have taken part in such a major public appointment. Before I entered Parliament, I worked in the voluntary sector and tried to get children involved in appointments. It is hard work and it requires a lot of preparation if children are to be fully and meaningfully involved. Those young people who have been involved in the appointment in Wales have said publicly that the process was a huge boost and showed the great value that was placed on their views. The appointment will have great validity, and I am sure that the commissioner will make a difference to what happens in Wales.<br><br>
I am concerned about the Department for Education and Employment's announcement that child minders will be able to smack children in their care, and smoke in their presence, if the parents allow it. However, it is clear that the announcement applies to England alone. I am sure that good sense will prevail in Wales and that, at the same time as the Queen's Speech proposes a ban on tobacco advertising, we will do our utmost to protect children from being in smoke-filled atmospheres. I hope, too, that we will not treat child minding as different from any other setting in which day care takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that it had been made clear that the announcement applied to England alone. I was unaware of that fact. Will she confirm that that is definitely the case, because if so, I greatly welcome it?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Department for Education and Employment press release stated categorically that it applied to England alone. I understand that the National Assembly will consult on the matter, and that working groups are considering the issues, so I presume that the matter will be decided in the Assembly and hope that there will be a Welsh solution that takes into account some of the strong feelings of the voluntary bodies. We should do our utmost to protect children from smoke-filled atmospheres, and I hope that the commissioner will have an input into that decision.<br><br>
However important the appointment of a commissioner is, it is only one of many measures needed if we are to create a children's Wales in which children can grow up freely and happily and develop to their full potential. The Government have given a brave commitment to end child poverty by 2020. Many measures are already in place: child benefit is at record levels and the working families tax credit has been introduced. By August, 130,000 children in Wales will be in families that have benefited from the working families tax credit. The Chancellor stated in the pre-Budget report that he would raise children's tax credit to £10 a week. The minimum wage and record employment levels will also benefit children.<br><br>
The introduction of the Children's Commissioner marks the way in which a devolved Wales will be closer to what people want. There is a real difference in the relationship with the voluntary sector, which feels involved in the decisions being taken in the Assembly. Other decisions will be made that show Wales taking a different direction from England and pursuing policies more appropriate to Wales. For example, there appear to be no plans to abolish community health councils in Wales. I am happy about that, because I believe that they should be strengthened and developed rather than closed or replaced.<br><br>
We will gradually work towards a devolved Wales in which the country's particular needs are met. We are making that shift. Of the 15 Bills mentioned in the Queen's Speech, I am sure that the Bill relating to the Children's Commissioner will get through before a general election. That represents a significant movement in the right direction, and I congratulate the people involved.</span></p>
<p>5.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith<span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse many comments made by my colleagues in today's debate. I am especially pleased with the part of the Queen's Speech that deals with yobbish behaviour. At a surgery only this weekend in my constituency, I had several representations from my constituents about the problems that occur in many housing estates in town centres and inner-city areas. Mr. John McInery, who lives in Denbigh way in Barry, has decided to take a stand on the matter and is delighted that the Government are introducing legislation to assist him in doing that.<br><br>
I feel comfortable about the Government's chosen way of tackling yobbish behaviour. We started our campaign against crime by stating that we would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
tough not only on crime but on the causes of crime. In my constituency, we have been especially tough on the causes of crime. In merely three and a half years, unemployment has dropped to a level that, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, was considered to be full employment, because the measure accommodates change in employment from job to job. Employment in my constituency has increased to the highest level ever recorded. Not all my hon. Friends share those benefits and statistics, but we are moving in that direction.<br><br>
Youngsters in my constituency cannot tell me that they cannot get a job, because that is no longer a problem—but it was a problem three and a half years ago. There is a problem with underemployment, low-paid employment and low-skill employment, but that is a different problem. Youngsters can find work and occupy themselves. We have seen a decline in crimes such as burglary and car stealing by youngsters, but we have not seen a general improvement in behaviour, particularly in towns on Friday and Saturday nights. There is no excuse for that, and the sooner we deal with it efficiently and fairly, the better.<br><br>
My greatest pleasure in the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget speech comes from the way in which the Government have handled the economy and created a stable economic environment with low interest rates, low inflation, a large increase in employment and decrease in unemployment, and a stable environment in which small and medium-sized businesses in Wales can grow. However, I want to draw the attention of all Committee members to the problem of Wales having such a small economy. One or two large companies are having difficulties because the weakness of the euro and the strength of the pound are causing problems in manufacturing, and we must take all possible measures, in conjunction with the Welsh Assembly, to protect our industries while our economy is growing. A major haemorrhage of jobs in Wales could knock the future growth of our GDP per capita off course, and we still have a lot of work to do on that.<br><br>
I am particularly concerned about an organisation in my constituency that I know well. I tabled a question in the House a couple of years ago asking what plans the Secretary of State for Defence had for the future of our aviation repair agencies and the creation of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency, which is based at RAF St. Athan in Wales and at RAF Sealand in your constituency, Mr. Jones. I am deeply concerned at the major change of thinking in that organisation recently, because it could have a dramatic effect on the economy of south Wales. DARA is one of the largest employers in south Wales and provides well-paid and highly skilled jobs.<br><br>
DARA at RAF St. Athan is a vital component in the aviation industry in the area. If anything should happen to the scale of its operation, there would be a huge knock-on effect on the south Wales economy. Until a couple of months ago, we had every reason to believe that if DARA continued in the way set out in its corporate plan and framework document when it was launched on 1 April 1999, there would be major investment and an expansion of jobs. When I raised
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
constituents' concerns about discussions taking place within the organisation, they were categorically denied and my integrity was questioned by senior employees of that organisation. However, it now appears that proposals are being considered that could dramatically affect employment levels at RAF St. Athan. Those proposals include moving its headquarters not only from RAF St. Athan but from Wales altogether, 18 months after it went there. That would affect only 80 jobs, but if an organisation or company loses its headquarters, people lose confidence. That is why it is vital that the DARA headquarters should stay in Wales and in St. Athan. The organisation is considering moving 165 high-precision, skilled aero-engine jobs from RAF St. Athan in south Wales to Fleetlands in Hampshire. If that decision goes through—as I believe that it will—it could have a big knock-on effect on the Welsh economy.<br><br>
Worst of all, the organisation is considering moving the operation at RAF St. Athan a couple of miles down the road to a new hangar at Cardiff international airport. I am not against new investment—it is to be welcomed and encouraged—but the problem is that the new facility is designed to take only 1,500 people, whereas about 3,000 people work on the RAF base at St. Athan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend's flow, as he is rightly making a passionate plea on behalf of his constituents. Is he worried about whether the agency—which is, after all, a public agency with substantial amounts of public money—is properly accountable to Members of Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that timely intervention. I do not think that the agency is at all accountable. The framework document clearly stipulates that its chief executive officers should be accountable not only to the House but to its Back Bencher—yet we can get nothing out of it. It is a major public agency, with a turnover of £500 million a year and capital assets of £260 million to £270 million a year, and such behaviour is completely unacceptable.<br><br>
I shall not develop the argument any further, having flagged up the position for the benefit of members of the Committee. I hope that word will be passed on to hon. Members who are not present. This is a major issue for Wales and for the Welsh economy. The organisation's employees do not come only from my constituency: they are drawn from as far away as Carmarthen to the west, Chepstow to the east and the heads of the valleys and Brecon to the north. The catchment area is huge.<br><br>
I am not opposed in principle to radical changes—I ask only that they are made openly and transparently so that the House can scrutinise them properly. I am worried that decisions are being taken behind closed doors, that information is not being published and that the work force are living in a climate of fear. This is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
year 2000—macho management and the running of organisations through fear should be unacceptable in the private sector, never mind the public sector.<br><br>
I passionately believe that if decisions are taken openly and transparently—and if the only consideration is the commercial success of the organisation and value for money—RAF St. Athan and Wales will come out on top, as there was every possibility that they would when I first tabled that question.</span></p>
<p>5.13 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards<span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having been unable to attend the early part of the debate this morning, thereby missing the opportunity of listening to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I congratulate his constituents and colleagues in Torfaen on securing world heritage status for Blaenavon, which is a tremendous achievement. Part of my constituency is in the Torfaen district council area, and I know that it will be a great asset to Monmouthshire and the surrounding areas.<br><br>
This morning, my right hon. Friend spoke about the success of the Welsh economy. It is to his credit that he is part of a Government who have overseen some of the most successful changes in the Welsh economy for many years. Professor Talbot of the university of Glamorgan recently stated that the Welsh economy is enjoying better conditions than at any time since the 1950s and 1960s. The Welsh economy is booming— one may not wish to say that, as we know what always follows booms—although the economy of south-east Wales may not be doing as well as that of south-east England. I hope that we shall be able to sustain steady growth, low inflation and stable interest rates, because that is essential to ensure that we have the resources for health, education, policing and other elements of the Government's programme.<br><br>
I represent a rural constituency in which a car is a necessity. I congratulate the Government on their recognition in the pre-Budget statement of the concern in rural areas. Many of the small farmers whom I represent are also small hauliers and were facing higher fuel costs. Costs in farming have been increasing while incomes have been falling. I do not share the analysis of farming of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who has one farm in his constituency. I have several hundred farmers in my constituency, and I know from my discussions with them that they do not agree with his analysis. I am inclined to agree with the farmers in my constituency rather than with my hon. Friend, who knows that we disagree.<br><br>
Many small farmers have to use their trucks to take stock to market and to abattoirs. There is no abattoir in south-east Wales and many farmers now take their stock to Kenilworth, where I recently visited the new abattoir developed by Farmers First. It is right that the Government recognised those costs and introduced measures to freeze fuel duty, to reduce duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel and to offer rebates of up to half the cost of vehicle excise duty.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many garages in the hon. Gentleman's constituency sell ultra-low sulphur petrol?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of the number, but I was pleased that the Chancellor announced some the changes and the review in a reply to a parliamentary question from me.<br><br>
In my constituency, one of the leading lights of the so-called people's fuel protest, Mr. David Handley, received a lot of publicity. He came to lobby me some months ago and the only issue that he wanted to talk about was fox hunting. I do not recall him talking about the problems facing small farmers, but if he did, I apologise. He came with other people from the Countryside Alliance to lobby me on hunting.<br><br>
I represent a rural area with a tradition of hunting that appreciates the service provided by the hunt in taking away fallen stock and getting rid of foxes, which are predators. However, when my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) introduced a private Member's Bill two years ago, four out of five of the letters that I received from rural and urban parts of Monmouthshire were in favour of the Bill. The majority of my constituents believe that it is morally wrong to hunt animals with dogs as a sport. If some foxes are pests or predators, they must be destroyed in the most effective way, but what is the conservation value of other forms of hunting—for example, what value is there for the community in setting two dogs on a hare that has been released? There is concern that the debate has focused solely on fox hunting and not on other forms of hunting that are irrelevant to conservation.<br><br>
An important element of the pre-Budget statement concerned pensioners. Just a few days before the statement, I attended a meeting of the Monmouth pensioners' forum. I have supported the forum's campaign to restore the link between pensions and earnings that was lost under the previous Government. However, as I told those pensioners, I could not have anticipated some of the measures that the Government would introduce to ensure that pensioners, particularly those on low incomes, will do better than if the link had been restored. I was surprised to learn that 50 per cent, of female pensioners do not receive the full state pension, and that is the precise group that will benefit from the Government's commitment to the minimum income guarantee. I wish that its title was different, because it is confusing. I have asked the Government to reconsider the name, and perhaps we can discuss that.<br><br>
It is right that the Government are committed to targeting resources at pensioners with the lowest incomes. By April next year, the minimum income guarantee will amount to £92, and by April 2003 to £100.<br><br>
I support the pensions credit. Many pensioners have occupational pensions, private pensions or modest earnings that take them above the level at which they would be entitled to the minimum income guarantee. It is to the Government's credit that they are examining the pensions credit in order to provide additional resources. In the past couple of weeks, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
have met pensioners who have benefited from the £200 winter fuel allowance, the Christmas bonus—modest though that is at the moment—and the free television licences for those who are more than 75 years old. None of the pensioners in Monmouthshire to whom I spoke regard any of those initiatives as gimmicks, nor do they expect them to be taken away by the Conservative party, were it ever to return to government.<br><br>
I welcome the Government's commitment to the national plan for health, and I hope that its principles will be introduced in Wales. In my constituency, we have seen significant improvements in health provision. I recently attended the opening of a new community hospital in Chepstow, the plans for which were announced shortly after the Government assumed power. I was delighted to attend its official opening by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) and Jane Hutt, the Health and Social Services Secretary in the Welsh Assembly.<br><br>
Jane Hutt also formally opened the new day surgery unit at Neville Hall hospital in Abergavenny, which will improve health provision in my constituency by allowing patients to get quick elective surgery and to return home on the same day. I hope that the Government and the Welsh Assembly are equally committed to ensuring that we get a new, integrated community hospital in Monmouth with integrated health and social care provision. That project will be a prime example of breaking down the so-called Berlin wall between health and social services.<br><br>
I welcome Jane Hutt's commitment not to abolish community health councils, as is currently proposed in England. That shows that the Assembly has listened to Welsh representations. I pay tribute to the people who serve in community health councils in Gwent for representing the consumer interest on matters such as deficiencies in the ambulance service in Monmouthshire. I am pleased that the chairman of the All Wales Ambulance Trust will meet me on Friday to discuss those problems.<br><br>
I welcome the commitment in the Queen's Speech to the special educational needs and disability Bill. That will strengthen the right of pupils with special educational needs to attend mainstream education. Many of my hon. Friends will know the value of integration. It is good to see pupils with different disabilities—learning as well as physical disabilities— integrated in our primary and senior schools, and it is great that that will continue. The Overmonnow special needs unit was recently commended in an inspector's report, and I pay tribute to its teachers and staff.<br><br>
The criminal justice and police Bill will be welcome in my constituency. There is a widespread feeling that town centres are unsafe environments, especially at weekends, as a result of drink-related disorder. I do not wish to exaggerate the significance of that in my constituency—there have been isolated incidents, but not as many as in some other constituencies. There have been problems in Abergavenny, Monmouth and Chepstow, and I discussed them with the police. I note that there is provision in the Bill for closing licensed premises, but I hope that there can be a greater
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
emphasis on pubwatch schemes, which can help collaboration between licensees, the police and local communities to ensure that pubs are run in a way that does not encourage unruly behaviour. The pubwatch scheme has been especially successful in that respect.<br><br>
In my constituency, the Gwent police deserve credit for the fall in crime over the past year. A few weeks ago, I was delighted to have a meeting with the chief constable, at which I presented to him a letter that was sent to me by the Prime Minister commending Gwent police for that fall in crime.<br><br>
I pay tribute to Usk prison, which recently received a favourable report from Her Majesty's inspectorate of prisons and gained the charter mark award and Investors in People accreditation.<br><br>
The pre-Budget statement and the Queen's Speech show the Government's commitment to ensuring a stable economy and to putting the resources into public services that Wales needs. That is appreciated by the people of Monmouthshire.</span></p>
<p>5.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton<span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, apologise for failing to be here at the beginning of the sitting. I had various transport problems last night and today, and I now find that I have a hole in my shoe.<br><br>
This has been a good debate. I was especially pleased to hear the hon. Member for Ribble Valley predicting a host of Tory gains in Wales at the next general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including Gower.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Caton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that he includes Gower, because the last time that I remember the hon. Gentleman making a prediction with such confidence and enthusiasm was in the Gloucester room of the guild hall in Swansea when he was still a county councillor, when he said that the poll tax was here to stay. His foresight has not improved.<br><br>
The debate has given us a valuable chance to refocus on my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's statement a few weeks after he delivered it. Budget announcements do not always look the same after they have been subjected to the cold light of several dawns, especially once our constituents have had the chance to wipe away the rose tints from our spectacles. In this case, however, I am still hearing a warm welcome in Gower for my right hon. Friend's words. The measure that went down best was the promised increase in the basic state pension in the next two years, which, together with the winter fuel payment that they have been picking up in the past few days, has cheered up the elderly in my patch considerably.<br><br>
Pensioners' groups remain wary of the idea of the pensions credit, which is out for consultation, but they are prepared to consider it and to judge it on whether it can contribute to tackling the two core related issues of pensioner poverty: the uptake of entitlements and the stigma associated with existing means-tested benefits. If the pensions credit—in tandem with the campaign to improve take-up of the minimum income
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
guarantee—looks likely to deal with those issues, it will be recognised as a major achievement. If it does not, the campaign to restore the link between the basic pension increase and average earnings will be renewed.<br><br>
In my constituency, the Chancellor and the Government have won considerable good will on pensions, because people can see that their concerns have been listened to and responded to. That is also true of fuel duty. The combination of measures— cutting fuel duty at the same time as encouraging low consumption and the use of less polluting fuel—made sense to most people who have talked to me since last month's statement.<br><br>
In the Welsh Grand Committee that followed the previous Budget, I congratulated the Chancellor on the introduction of the aggregates levy to encourage more recycling by taxing quarrying and marine dredging. In the pre-Budget statement, he introduced another welcome measure: the creation of a new fund to be used for environmental improvement work in areas that are detrimentally affected by aggregate extraction. However, Treasury briefings suggest that only areas subjected to quarrying have been identified as eligible to benefit. I hope that the Government will reconsider that. If it can be shown that the Gower coast, and other parts of the south Wales coast, have lost sand partly or entirely as a result of marine dredging in the Bristol channel, those areas should also have access to funds for remedial work.<br><br>
I will deal in detail with only one matter arising from the Queen's Speech, and it relates to crime. I should first like to add my delight at the creation of the Children's Commissioner. It is a good sign for the future of devolution in Wales. The Government have got it right by identifying crime and health as matters of enormous concern. Like others, I worry about the extension of child curfew orders. It is important that when we debate the criminal justice and police Bill all those concerns about principle and practicality are properly explored.<br><br>
The appalling behaviour of sometimes quite small numbers of people, adults and children, is undoubtedly making the lives of a lot more people a living hell. I am sure that most, if not all of us, know of places in our constituencies where decent people's lives are being ruined by the deliberate despoliation of their living environment, by fears of the impact on their children and all too often by direct threats of physical violence against themselves and their property. The vast majority of the victims are ordinary, working-class people whose financial and personal circumstances make it impossible for them simply to up sticks and move away from their tormentors. We must get it right. The Government are certainly right to recognise the extent of the problem and to give priority to tackling it.</span></p>
<p>5.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, apologise for not being here this morning. I am sure that the Secretary of State was optimistic, like my good friend, Labour party member Roger Warren Evans, who arrived in London today having walked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
the 220 miles from Swansea to London in his walk against ageism. He is 65 today, and I am six months older than he is, so I know what it feels like. There were times this morning, when I faced a road block on the M4, that I felt that I should have joined him, and got here earlier.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Queen's Speech is one of the thinnest documents since Lowry painted his matchstick men and women working near Six Bells colliery, which the Secretary of State knows well. This sparse speech can mean only one thing: a spring general election. Therefore it must be populist and it must appeal to the tabloids, which will spread the message far and wide. Hence there are six macho Bills on crime. There is one on law enforcement and disorderly conduct, and I agree with much of it. There is a second on private security, a third on vehicle crime, a fourth on money laundering, a fifth on benefit fraud and a sixth on scrapping half the juries.<br><br>
I suppose that all that would apply to an unemployed security guard who, after being dismissed from a jury, went out and got drunk, stole a car, flogged it and put the money in a Swiss bank account and then falsely claimed benefits while working in the black economy. This is an effort to out-tough the Tories in the run-up to the election. Much of it is aimed at the south-east of England, and to calming down middle England; it is far removed from the realities of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that rogue employees and employers in the private security industry have put people at risk—on housing estates in Wales, for instance? Such matters are relevant to Wales and have been part of the Labour party's programme for a time, and it is good that we can get on with them in this year's legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that rogue employers in the security sector have been a problem. But all that could have been combined in one Bill, instead of needing six. In some parts of Wales it is hard to find a policemen or an open police station. The best message would have been to have a "bobbies on the beat and community cop shop" Bill. That would be far more appropriate. At least then we would see some police about and know where to go and find them, instead of viewing the backside of a 130mph Volvo.<br><br>
Yes, crime is a problem, but we need to get the police nearer the people. Instead, in our area the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary have just succeeded in abolishing and amalgamating our probation service. The Chief Constable is trying to deconstruct the line management in the Dyfed-Powys police force, which hitherto had the best record in Wales. The reintroduction of the Bill to reduce jury trials is a folly, and it will be defeated again, although we welcome other aspects of the Bill.<br><br>
Crime must be tackled. Youth disorderliness happens in many of our town centres and it must be dealt with, which can be done effectively only by having more policemen on the beat. The Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
have made a start but there is a huge distance to go. Indeed, yobs drinking alcohol are a huge problem wherever one goes in the United Kingdom at present.<br><br>
The town that I grew up in in mid-Wales used to have three policemen; now it has none. It has only the occasional visit from a police car. It used to have a police station and now there is none. One third of the legislative programme in the Queen's Speech is about crime, when one Bill would have done. We in Wales are the poor relations of the Home Office in many respects. We need to address some of the problems even more urgently, but we suffer from a lack of manpower in the police. I know that the Government have done something about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Especially in Dyfed-Powys.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is only the second increase: the Tories gave us only one in 18 years.<br><br>
On a more positive note, we are pleased with the commitment to improve the importance and effectiveness of the NHS. There will be legislation on long-term care for the elderly. Alzheimer's and such conditions are hugely important and very tragic. Indeed, I am sure that the Assembly will want to get its teeth into that part of the legislation. Obviously we welcome the Children's Commissioner. That was in our manifesto for the Welsh Assembly and we have advocated it for a long time. We welcome Mr. Clarke's appointment. It is vital that he has adequate resources and is accountable to the National Assembly for Wales. There seem to be misconceptions in Tory central office about that, but that is only to be expected.<br><br>
We regret that there is only one direct Bill of this kind going to Wales—although there are other aspects of other Bills that will cover Wales. But there are many other things that should have been done in relation to Wales. What about a strategic rail authority for Wales, for example, and legislative powers for the National Assembly? We welcome the banning of tobacco advertising. That is a constructive move. Its influence on young people, and the effects of tobacco on health, such as increases in cancer, are a huge problem in their own right.<br><br>
The hunting with dogs Bill is a decoy. It is vital that the gun packs are allowed to continue, in upland Wales in particular. Two thousand foxes are killed every year in my constituency, and the damage that they do by killing lambs amounts to at least to £500,000; that is a huge loss to the economy and to the livelihood of the people who live there. Because of the state that rural Wales is in now, the blow inflicted by fuel prices has been enormous. There are ways through the problem that are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech or in measures brought forward by the Chancellor. I cannot for the life of me think why grant aid is not given to low pressure gas, which is about 30p a litre cheaper than conventional fuel—and one cannot find many ultra-low sulphur fuel pumps in mid-Wales.<br><br>
Family farms are facing the biggest crisis of my lifetime. There is no income there and the problem is not being addressed properly. When we ask for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0043">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
agrimonetary compensation for farmers, we are only asking for money that they did not get for their products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have had it every time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No; farmers have had compensation one year in two. They have lost out enormously because of the exchange rate. There was no mention of rural services in either the rural White Paper for England or the Queen's Speech.<br><br>
Labour has been a disaster for the countryside, and for farming in particular. It had an honourable record in the past—Tom Williams introduced the epoch-making Agriculture Act 1947—but the National Assembly for Wales has a more constructive attitude to farming than the Labour Government in London. The National Assembly is pursuing the agrifood policy and other issues relating to the farming industry. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Whitehall has not done its stuff for farming. The price for milk is l0p less a litre than it was two years ago, and many of the dairy farmers in my constituency are facing bankruptcy. The Government must treat the issue seriously; there is an exodus of young people from the countryside and they will not return, because there is no living to be made there. That is very serious for the language, the culture and many other aspects of our nation.<br><br>
I agree with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), especially about the health authorities. There is no longer a case for health authorities; they are bureaucracy that should be subsumed into one health authority for Wales, under the National Assembly. The money spent on the Dyfed Powys health authority, which costs £6 million to run, could be better spent on patients and on more effective targeting of health needs in Wales—and that should be done sooner rather than later.<br><br>
The economy and jobs in Wales are variable; there is success in some places but the position is patchy in others. There are still far too many low-paid jobs in the economy, but I congratulate the Government and the National Assembly on redoubling their efforts in that respect. The upskilling of young people for the new technological industries is vital for the economy of Wales. Quality jobs will come to Wales only if we have trained and skilled people to do them. We are starting to win that battle but we have a long way to go; European objective 1, 2 and 3 funding will assist us in that task.<br><br>
I cannot understand why the Government do not accept that there is a Welsh nationality, and why they will not do anything about the census form. It is extraordinary that this is the only nation in the United Kingdom that will not have the same opportunity as the others. If we are not careful, there will be an inadequate census, and we must be responsible about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman please respond to what I said?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many hon. Members in the Committee whom I have not mentioned. Pensioners have been referred to, and the Government have started to tackle their problems. The Conservative party would take away pensioners' benefits and put them into a pension, but when everything is added up and the allowances subtracted, they would receive only 42p extra—30p less than the Chancellor gave them a year ago. The Chancellor made a decent start in trying to give pensioners a proper pension this year. My view is that the link between earnings and pensions should be restored, and the sooner that that happens the better. The money is there.<br><br>
We have heard what was, inevitably, a pre-election Queen's Speech.<br><br>
The introduction of the Children's Commissioner is an excellent measure. A complex mix of tough measures on crime has been announced. However, the abandonment of rural Wales is, frankly, a disgrace to the founding fathers of the Labour party. There should be a major rethink on that, because the problem is much more serious than is realised. Please, please do something about it.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had the usual wide-ranging and interesting debate. I agree with the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) that we should be judged not on what we say but on results. The Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement include action to create the lowest levels of unemployment that we have known, to support pensioners and to extend the new deal. There is proposed legislation on crime, the Children's Commissioner, tobacco advertising and health. We shall be judged on the positive results that those measures will have for people in Wales.<br><br>
It is interesting to compare and contrast the reactions of the different parties. Some 11 Labour Members have spoken and, with one or two exceptions, there has been a positive welcome for the pre-Budget speech and the Gracious Speech. We have had two speeches from Conservative Members, including one from the hon. Member for North Dorset that focused solely on the Children's Commissioner. I look forward to discussing that with him in Committee, and I shall deal with it later in my speech. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley spoke about the economy. As my hon. Friends said, the Conservatives must realise that, after 18 years of their rule and given their record in office, it is a bit rich for them to start making suggestions about things that should have been included in the pre-Budget statement and in legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) spoke about the Conservative record in his usual effective way.<br><br>
We have had two contributions from Liberal Democrat Members. The hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) have played "good cop, bad cop" today. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has been Mr. Consensus, giving positive, warm welcomes to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
Government initiatives, which has been good. We have had a bit more of the bad cop from the stir crazy, ready-to-go hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, and I shall return to some of his points. Between them, they have given us an uncosted wish list of proposals.<br><br>
Then there are the nationalists—I will not call them the party of Wales, because evidently they are not, given the number of hon. Members on the Government Benches. I reluctantly have a soft spot for the hon. Member for Ceredigion. He has been a Member for only nine months, but he has made a good impression and is doing well. He said today that he wants more money for various things and that he wants more power for the Assembly, and he gave a grudging welcome to some of the Bills contained in the Queen's Speech. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli asked how, if and when the things that the hon. Gentleman wants will happen when the economy of Wales is split off from that of the rest of the United Kingdom. If he cannot answer those points in detail, he has a lot to learn about the House and the standard of contributions required. Those questions must be answered and, if they are not answered today, they will be answered at the general election because the points made by my right hon. Friend are essential to the economic case that damns nationalism in Wales and will prevent it from ever succeeding in the way in which the hon. Gentleman would wish it to succeed.<br><br>
The pre-Budget statement has brought economic benefits. My hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), for Bridgend and for Vale of Clwyd have pointed to the high levels of employment in Wales, the strong Welsh economy, and the investment in Wales brought by this year's spending review. Everyone knows that unemployment is now lower in every Welsh constituency. We can compare and contrast the approach taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd, who talked Wales up, with that of certain Opposition Members, who pointed to the failures of the Welsh economy. There is a strong case for us to point to the general positives, and to say that we have a strong economy and high employment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) mentioned his genuine concerns about possible impact on DARA. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has met the relevant Minister in the Ministry of Defence, and will report shortly. He is willing to meet my hon. Friend again to discuss the situation, which I am grateful has been brought to the attention of the Committee.<br><br>
The pre-Budget review draws on this year's spending review. Before it, thanks to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's previous commitments, we were already to have major investment in public services via the National Assembly and central Government during the next three years.<br><br>
I want to draw hon. Members' attention to pensions. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West has had to leave, as he seemed warm towards the Government's pension proposals, which show that the Government are making positive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
moves for pensioners. The Conservatives would abolish next year's increases of £5 and £8, the minimum income guarantee, the pensioner credit and the winter fuel allowance, all of which my hon. Friends spoke strongly for.<br><br>
I contrast again the difference between my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, who said that the minimum income guarantee was a positive measure—my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd also pointed to the future increases—and the whinge of the hon. Member for Ceredigion. All that he could do was ask why sufficient pensioners had not taken up the minimum income, when what we need is a strong campaign to encourage pensioners to take it up.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda mentioned the extension of the new deal. All hon. Members now have people off benefit, into work and contributing to society thanks to that extension. The extension to over-25s, lone parents and disabled people and the communities and neighbourhood funds announced in the pre-Budget review are positive steps, as is the extra school cash of £9·9 million for Welsh schools following my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's announcement.<br><br>
I shall deal with a point made by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon. Edwina Hart, the Assembly Member for Gower, who has responsibility for finance in the Assembly, responded to criticisms that housing and education budgets would be raided for match funding. Her Budget speech states:
<br><blockquote><p>We have received what we wanted in real terms, and I do not accept that this has impacted on any other budget.</p></blockquote>
There will be more money for schools and more support for the objective 1 funding scheme, and there is general support from the National Assembly in terms of money received.<br><br>
My final point on the pre-Budget review was raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth. In September, there was concern about fuel duties. I represent a rural area, and farmers from my constituency went to Stanlow oil refinery. I had met them before and knew that they were concerned. Such concerns were the reason for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's announcement in the pre-Budget review of a freezing of fuel duty until 2002 and a reduction of 3p on low sulphur fuel, which will be introduced soon in Wales. He took £300 million off vehicle excise duty across the UK, and he undertook support for the industry. The Government listened, and took action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister discuss the Chancellor's statement about the use of fiscal powers to stimulate the economy by way of regional policy, especially with regard to operating aids? On the Floor of the House this afternoon, the Prime Minister made the positive statement that the matter is now for the Treasury, not Brussels, following the Nice conference. Will the Minister assure us that the Wales Office will work positively with the National Assembly to try to secure those important instruments of policy?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Assembly's Economic Development Committee will consider a progress report on that issue. We should want to see what is said on the matter, and to take account of the outcome of Nice. We will consider the issue, but I do not want to give the right hon. Gentleman any commitment on policy issues.<br><br>
The legislative programme has shown, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) mentioned, that devolution has worked. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon pointed out several measures that will support the Assembly and provide it with powers. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, we are trying to give the Assembly maximum flexibility with respect to the Bills. The special educational needs Bill, the commonhold leasehold Bill, the homes Bill, the health modernisation Bill and the Children's Commissioner Bill will establish additional responsibility or flexible powers for the National Assembly. That shows that the devolution settlement has worked.<br><br>
The Children's Commissioner Bill has been welcomed by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon and by my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North, for Rhondda, for Clwyd, South and for Bridgend. My hon. Friends the Members for Bridgend and for Cardiff, North highlighted the speedy and positive reaction to the Waterhouse report by the Government and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I welcome the support that the hon. Member for North Dorset gave to the Bill. I take a similar view to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North, that it is not irreconcilable to want to support families in the home at the same time as wanting to tackle child abuse and protect children in the community. I look forward to the Opposition's comments during the passage of the Bill, but I hope for support that is neither grudging nor lacking. I hope that Opposition Members will be in the Lobby with us when the time comes.<br><br>
I welcome the measures in the health Bill on tobacco. It is an England and Wales Bill, but within the modernisation Bill there is flexibility for the National Assembly to consider matters in a Wales-wide context. I and many other hon. Members are pleased that we are to take action to ban tobacco advertising.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentions pre-legislative consultations with the National Assembly on various issues. Would he consider pre-legislative consultations with Members of this House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have indeed produced draft Bills for consultation and there will be opportunities for comment during the passage of measures.<br><br>
The special educational needs Bill mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda is a matter of particular importance, as is the crime Bill, mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Glamorgan and for Clwyd, South. Vehicle crime accounts for 30 per cent, of all the crime in Wales. If we can legislate in this House to reduce it, we should. Similarly, the homes Bill, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, is an important measure for tackling homelessness.<br><br>
Lastly, the hunting Bill is the subject of a manifesto commitment. All Members of Parliament will have an opportunity to take a view on hunting. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and my hon. Friends the Members for Clwyd, South and for Bridgend have explained their views, and I know mine. I have a hunt in my constituency. The Government are giving hon. Members the opportunity to take a view on the issue. That is a manifesto commitment that is being fulfilled. Like so much else in the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement, it is a question of achieving what we said we would do on 1 May 1997, before the next general election, whether that comes at the end of this Session or the end of a further Session in May 2002.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement highlight the differences between the Labour Government—who try to deliver on the issues and are committed to social justice—and the Conservative party, which has pledged to reduce public spending in every constituency in Wales and to take on the Assembly in order to cut its public spending and deny legislative opportunities.<br><br>
Plaid Cymru, a nationalist party, has a wish list that it cannot achieve, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli said. It will not allow people in Wales to take decisions.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech and the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Statement as they relate to Wales.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at Six o 'clock.</i></p>
