I want to raise the issue of our meeting at 10.30 am on a Monday morning in London. We have clearly made an effort to be here, although only a third of those Labour Members involved and three quarters of Plaid Cymru Members are present. No Liberal Democrats have arrived so far. The timing of our debate is inconvenient. I accept that Standing Orders require us to meet at 10.30 am if we are meeting at all, but surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government to change the Standing Orders if they cause problems. If we have to meet on Monday morning, may I suggest to the Government, through you Mr. Jones, that we meet in Wales, as we have done previously? That would be far more convenient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard what the right hon. Gentleman said, but it is not a matter for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech and the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Statement as they relate to Wales.</p></blockquote>
As for what the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) said about the timing of our debate, I understand that the usual channels discussed the matter. As a Member of the National Assembly for Wales, he will be aware that, as Members of Parliament, we were anxious to debate the Queen's Speech in the same week as the Assembly. Tomorrow, I shall travel to Cardiff to present the legislative programme speech to the National Assembly. It was felt fitting to debate the issue both here and in the Assembly as quickly as possible in the week following the Queen's Speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point about timing and the difficulties that hon. Members face when travelling here on a Monday. I also take the point about meeting in Wales and I am sure that there will be an opportunity during the remainder of the session for that to happen. Incidentally, for some hon. Members, it is not as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
simple to get to Cardiff as it is to get to London, certainly in the case of those who represent constituencies in the north of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate concerns the pre-Budget report and the Government's legislative programme. Both matters are about our commitment to social justice and enterprise, and our continuing programme of reform and modernisation of the United Kingdom. The Government's momentum is as strong now as it was on the day that we were elected. That is because we rejected the short-term solutions that were offered by many Opposition Members and refused to following the prescriptions of the Conservative party that would have taken us back to those years of boom and bust—mainly bust in the case of Wales—that hurt so many of our hard-working families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not inherit what the Conservatives call a golden economic scenario. We were elected to govern a country that had a weak economy. I shall set out the facts. Before we were elected, the Government's debt was increasing at the rate of £500 million a week. Because we tackled that debt crisis, we can now spend that money on public services in Wales. At the time, mass unemployment was regarded as a price worth paying and decisions about interest rates were taken on the basis of political calculation. They were artificially lowered before every election and whacked up after polling day. Our public services and public servants were treated with contempt, starved of investment and allowed to fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were elected on a programme to deal with all those problems, and we have stuck to that programme. We took the tough action needed to reduce the Government debt. We provided the economic stability needed to create jobs—approximately 1,000 new jobs a week since Labour came into office in 1997. We gave the Bank of England operational control of interest rates. We have announced our plans for public spending for the next three years, which include the largest ever boost for health service investment in Wales—£1.3 billion over and above the normal increases for those services. No Opposition Member here can claim that he or she supported those measures. The Tories remain committed to a return to the boom and bust economics that ruined so many lives in the 1980s and 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pre-Budget report shows that we were right. There has been a palpable change in the mood of the country after the publication of that report, and dividing lines between the parties have become crystal clear. Recent by-elections—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Recent by-elections show that people have decisively rejected the Tories, after comparing their plans for cuts with our plans for investment that were announced in the spending review and reinforced in the pre-Budget review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given the over-75s free television licenses. The Tories would take them away. We have increased the winter fuel allowance. The Tories would take that away, too. We have announced extra help for the poorest pensioners, which the Tories would also take

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
away. We have announced plans for fuel and vehicle licenses that are the equivalent to a cut of 8p a litre, while the Conservatives plan a cut of only 3p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State made a telling point about the poorest pensioners, but has he read the report published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which states that 500,000 more people in the United Kingdom, many of them elderly, have fallen below the poverty line? In Wales, 25,000 more people are below the poverty line than when Labour came into power. Is the Secretary of State proud of that fact?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend can speak in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not had the opportunity to read the report to which the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) refers. However, as he knows from the pre-Budget report, we have increased the basic rate of pension by £5 and £8—and there will be a further increase. We have put an extra £6 billion into pensioners' pockets and we are tackling the long-term problems of pensioner poverty. That is more than any previous Government have done for many years. The half a million pensioners in Wales benefit considerably from our policies. The hon. Gentleman can go to any town, village or city centre and ask pensioners what they think of recent measures, just as my party colleagues and I have done.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that the Opposition would refer to the Joseph Rowntree report, which is mentioned in today's 	<i>Western Mail.</i> The report uses 26 indicators of poverty, 17 of which have gone down, showing that poverty has reduced, and only 9 of which have risen. The figures to which Opposition Members refer are for the year up to 1999 and do not take into account the minimum wage, the working families tax credit or the new deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also worth while pointing out that we can give pensioners in Wales those increases because the United Kingdom has the fourth strongest economy in the world and because of the measures taken by my right hon.

The Government are doing all that they can to ensure that people are aware of that facility, which was intended to target the poorest pensioners and is only part of an overall package. The valley constituencies—but not exclusively those constituencies—have a huge share of the poorest pensioners in the United Kingdom. We must ensure that the minimum income guarantee is taken up.

Opposition Members should help pensioners instead of talking down those facilities and that support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One of the groups that has suffered unacceptably in recent months and years from the failure of Government policy is mainly made up of pensioners and comprises former coal miners and widows of coal miners whose compensation has still not been paid. When I was in Wrexham the week before last, I was told that, up to November, only two cases had been handled of the hundreds that await compensation. How can the Secretary of State say with a straight face that everything in the garden is rosy for pensioners,

	<p>	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman knows that that intervention was too long. Interventions must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that everyone here, from all political parties, are conscious that the miners' compensation must be paid as speedily as possible. He need not tell me about that. My father and grandfather were coal miners, I represent a coalmining constituency and I have visited constituents who are claiming that compensation. He must also be aware that, if it had not been for the Labour Government, those cases would never have been settled and the biggest compensation claim ever agreed would not have been paid out to coal miners and their widows. About 27,000 are eligible for that compensation in Wales. He is also aware that we decided in the past couple of weeks to ensure that a monitoring group will meet in Wales as well as here in London to consider the different measures. He must not for one second believe that those of us who represent mining constituencies and ex-mining constituencies are not worried about the matter. We are doing our best to ensure that the process is speeded up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my right hon. Friend responded in that way. It is only a short time since the court judgment, and considering that more than 120,000 applications were received and the huge problems experienced in establishing some of the claims, the process has gone reasonably well. We are bitterly disappointed that in areas such as the Rhondda and south Wales valleys the process is not immediate, but I wish that people would not make cheap political points out of something that I should have thought was beyond politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point.

Although we announced some £420 million to cover objective 1 spending in Wales, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), now the shadow Trade and Industry Secretary, told the House in February that a future Tory Government would scrap the structural funds programme. Indeed, the entire objective 1 saga tells us all that we need to know about our opponents. The Tories were the party that so damaged the economy of west Wales and the valleys that we qualified for objective 1 in the first place. Such was their hostility to the very idea of an active regional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
economic policy that they refused to apply for European aid. Now they are committed, so we are told, to scrapping that aid so as to increase the European rebate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Secretary of State has used a little licence in suggesting that any of my right hon. or hon. Friends stated that when returned to power the Conservatives would scrap objective 1. We are committed to the present Government's spending plans. It is this Government who have not provided any new money but used European money and said that that is their contribution to objective 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must raise the matter with his right hon. Friend the shadow Trade and Industry Secretary so that it can be made perfectly clear that we have heard a commitment today, in this Room, from the representative of the Conservative party, that it agrees with structural funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Plaid Cymru told us that we would not secure objective 1 status. They subsequently said that if we did do so we would not receive funding for all the parts of Wales for which we in fact did. They then told us that Europe would not approve those objective 1 plans, but it did. Subsequently, they said that we would not receive the money, but we have done so. Every time they were wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a strong economy is the foundation stone of the Government's achievement, it is only one aspect of our determination to modernise and strengthen our society. Our legislative programme shows just how determined we are to match the opportunity economy with a responsibility society, and part of that responsibility is our commitment to fighting crime together.

Last Wednesday, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), who is not present but who I am sure will arrive, told the BBC that the problems tackled in our crime Bills are not real but are merely perceptions. That reveals that in many respects our opponents in Wales do not live in the same world as us. Those with rural constituencies and those of us who represent valley seats or towns or cities all know that the problems of violent crime, especially among young people, and especially associated with alcoholism, are encountered throughout Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend worried about the proposed increase in spending for his area and for my area of Gwent for next year, which is 4.4 per cent., compared with that proposed for other areas in Wales, such as the North Wales and the Dyfed-Powys police, which will receive increases of more than 6 per cent? Has not the argument being made about the slight increase in crime in rural areas distorted Government policy to the extent that they are getting a huge increase compared to the towns and valleys of south Wales, where crime is still two to three times higher than in rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I am meeting the chief constables soon to discuss those matters, but I am not sure that I agree with his last point that crime is not a factor in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. Of course crime is a factor in rural areas. It has increased in rural areas as it has in some categories of urban areas, but if we compare the two, the crime rate in rural areas is still far lower than in the valleys or urban areas. Consideration has been made in the proposed figures, which I understand are not final, and the pressure exerted, quite legitimately, on the problems of rural areas has distorted the budget for next year that the increase in all areas is a good one, above inflation and we can take credit for the increase in every part of Wales. However, there is a distortion in the allocations, which unfairly penalises the valleys and towns in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I shall take up that matter with my hon. Friend, and when I meet the chief constables. I take his point about his own town, which has had its own difficulties in the past few years. The detection of crime by the Gwent police force is so high that sometimes the figures are distorted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns of ordinary people about yobbery on our streets are very real. Ordinary decent people want the law to be on their side. They want an end to antisocial public drinking. They want the police to have the powers necessary to close down pubs that are at the centre of violence and other trouble. Ordinary, decent people in Wales want us to take action against drug traffickers and car thieves, and we are doing all that we can to tackle those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our measures on police and vehicle crime are not the only steps that we must take to reinforce the responsibility society. We must legislate to regulate the private security industry. Violent crime is, as my hon. Friend has said, a particular problem in Wales and there can be no excuse for the sometimes random acts of violence committed by bouncers and other private security guards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will introduce a Health Bill to modernise and strengthen the national health service, and to provide for free nursing care for the elderly. Part of our long-term plan is to strengthen the health service. We will act to ban tobacco advertising and phase out tobacco sponsorship. That is another long-term measure that is much needed, because 20 per cent, of all deaths in Wales are tobacco-related. We have already published a Bill to give hon. Members a free vote on the future of hunting with dogs. We recognise that foxes are vermin and have to be controlled, and we will be discussing those matters with the Assembly if the Bill makes progress. We also recognise the very real strength of public feeling on the issue. That is why there will be a free vote in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly welcome the proposed ban on tobacco advertising. As for the Hunting Bill and other legislation to which the Secretary of State has referred, can he clarify which Bills will have a Welsh content that will allow the National Assembly to vary the details? On Friday, the First Minister pointed out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
that there were four such Bills. Will he clarify which four? The Hunting Bill is presumably one, but can he point them out as he refers to the other Bills?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I will. I have already touched on the health Bill, which will have Welsh implications, and I will point out the others as I go through them. Indeed, the next is one such Bill: we will legislate to increase the rights of the holders of long leases. That has long been a particular Welsh concern. We will bring in a separate homes Bill to make buying and selling houses easier and to provide more help for homeless families, of which there are 3,500 in Wales at present. Again, that is a matter about which we must liaise with the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, we are demonstrating one particular and special aspect of the responsibility society—the responsibility that we owe to our children. The Labour manifesto for the 1999 Assembly elections contained a commitment to the establishment of an independent Commissioner for Children. The creation and extension of that role is something of which Labour Members can be especially proud. Our commitment to extending the commissioner's powers shows that we are serious about making the devolution settlement work. That settlement, which was approved by the people of Wales in a referendum, maintains the responsibility here for primary legislation in Wales. However, it also imposes on us a responsibility to give the Assembly the tools that it needs to do its job of improving public services in Wales, to which we are committed. Incidentally, that commitment is not necessarily shared by the Conservative party. I have obtained a copy of its briefing for Members of Parliament on our legislative programme, which makes it clear that it has no intention of giving the Assembly that responsibility, or extending the role of commissioner. It states that a commissioner's advocacy role should be confined to
	<br><blockquote><p>those in the care of local authorities and some other services.</p></blockquote>
As usual, the Conservative party has missed the bus, as that role is already in the Care Standards Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Secretary of State is being very unfair to the Tories. Last week, I received a letter from the leader of the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly, who wanted extended powers and sought support for a check box. Clearly, they are concerned about vital issues in Wales, and it is unfair to criticise them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should concentrate for the moment on the Commissioner for Children, as his role was mentioned in the Queen's Speech. It seems that the Conservative party has not got used to liaising between Westminster and Cardiff. I am sure that Conservatives in Cardiff would not have had the same Queen's Speech briefing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to deal with this matter at greater length later, if I can catch your eye, Mr. Jones—but there is no inconsistency. In the Welsh Assembly, the amendment tabled by Conservative Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>asserts the importance of the family in protecting and nurturing children and therefore believes that the remit of the Children's Commissioner should relate exclusively to children's services provided by public and other agencies.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What do they say in London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What they say in London is that
	<br><blockquote><p>the rights of such a Commissioner should not be extended to supplant the role of parents who are the natural and right advocates for the interests of their children…They should not be undermined in a way which this legislation could make possible.</p></blockquote>
There is no question of the role of the role of Children's Commissioner, which is replicated in many European countries, undermining the role of parents. It will add to, enhance and complement the role of parents in looking after their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we are giving the Assembly the resources needed to improve services in Wales, I fear that the Conservatives' plans for public spending could have serious consequences not only for the services that Welsh people want and deserve, but for devolution itself. Billions of pounds worth of cuts in this country would inevitably impinge on Welsh public services through the block grant system, which would undermine and destabilise the whole concept of devolution. I hope that people are conscious of that in the months ahead, when we debate such public spending issues. It is a question not only of cuts in services but of undermining devolution. While we support the objective 1 programmes, the Tories— despite what the hon. Gentleman said—have doubts about structural funding. While we believe in "education, education, education", the Tory schools policy is cuts, cuts and cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tories would take us back, but we are determined to keep moving forward. The pre-Budget report and the Queen's Speech focus clearly on our priorities for Government—the opportunity economy and the responsibility society—and make clear the choices that we have made. We have chosen stability and not boom and bust, investment in public services and not cuts, devolution and not centralisation or separatism, and building strong communities and not an atomised and crumbling society. We are providing those new opportunities to work for a decent retirement and to enjoy a high quality education, and in return we expect responsibility to be shown to all, by all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had only just started, as the right hon. Gentleman acknowledged. (Hon. Members: "Setting the scene.") I will set the scene a little if I may. The Government have set out their prettiest baubles, shiniest toys, most elaborate confectionery—(Hon. Members: "Baubles?") I will explain why some of them are baubles. The big question is whether some of them will see the legislative light of day. Imagine the disappointment on the voters' faces in the new year when the glitter has worn off some of these wonderful initiatives and the Bills' batteries have run out without getting anywhere, and there is the tearful revelation that there is no Father Christmas, just Mr. Prudence dressed up against his will for this one Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad fact is that at the end of this Parliament, and at the end of the three years covered by the Red Book, even after the largesse that the pre-Budget report claims to offer, this Labour Government will be spending less of the UK's gross domestic product on public services—under 40 per cent, is the mantra— than the Conservatives did under the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major). The money may have gone up—(	<i>Laughter.</i>) Hon. Members may laugh, but as a proportion of GDP it is less money. They are being totally complacent if they think that the people of Wales want to see new Labour spend less on public services than the Tories did. Is that what they got elected to do? I do not think so, and I do not think that the public of Wales want to see that happen either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State raised a few issues in his opening remarks, perhaps to overcome some of the disquiet that the public of Wales will feel when they see that less of their money is being spent on public services than the Tories spent. He mentioned the recent settlement for pensioners. We welcomed that. It was a useful step forward—although it is three years late, and comes after a 75p slap in the face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We voted against it because it was too little. Every pensioner in Wales would vote against 75p too. Only the hon. Gentleman votes for 75p. We know what the pensioners of Wales need, and it is not 75p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing promised in the Queen's Speech is help with nursing care, despite the recommendation of the royal commission that help should be given for personal care. The Scottish Parliament has found its way around that and provided help for personal as well as nursing care. That is the sort of thing that older and elderly people in Wales would have liked to see in the pre-Budget statement and the Queen's Speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that Labour's achievements are not just for Christmas but for the long term? Will he admit that for the first time for 25 years the increase in pensions next year will

We have been asked to advance constructive ideas today. May I put forward a constructive idea to the Secretary of State about the miners compensation scheme? Many miners are having problems with the clawback from benefits payments. I say that not in a party political way, but as an explanation of why there

The clawback system has operated in civil liability cases for many years and no one has said anything about it. We should not forget that this is a piece of civil legislation. However, in this instance, as a result of pressure from Labour Members, and other hon.

After Christmas, it is pantomime time. Voters will have to get used to a great deal of farce as the Government try to persuade them that the broken promises and worn-down policies really are new, and working just as they seemed to in the shop window when the voters bought them and took them home. This was a pretty sorry Queen's Speech, which showed that the Government are bereft of energy and ideas. They are the fag end of a Government at the fag end of a Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend talks about the fag end of a Parliament, but there is no need for a general election until May 2002.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has put his finger on the issue. The Secretary of State just said that he did not know the date of the general election, so is he proposing that those 15 Bills will take us through to the next Queen's Speech? That would be a threadbare legislative programme.

In rural areas of Ceredigion, farm income has in the past year dropped from £4,000 a year, which the hon. Member for Newport, West would no doubt say was too much, to as little as £3,000 a year. The GDP of Wales is way behind that of the booming London and

south-east economy—just 79.4 per cent., compared with total UK GDP. In west Wales, the situation is even worse. What is the Government's remedy? What does the Queen's Speech say to people in rural and urban areas of Wales? Perhaps it will offer operational aids and lower corporation tax in objective 1 areas. That would be a good idea. [Hon. Members: "In legislation?"] It could be in the Finance Bill. Perhaps the Government will also propose lower national insurance payments, enabling small businesses to create new jobs in rural and urban areas. They could suggest a full funding settlement for objective 1, rather than the one third that we have now.

The Barnett formula could be based on need and deprivation, not on a per capita population basis. It might be useful to suggest that in a Queen's Speech, but we must go with convention in this place, and I am afraid that the Barnett formula still has some life left in it as long as the Government want to pump artificial aid by means of it. Rural areas will not benefit from any of the suggestions that have been made. The contribution that the Government want to make is a Bill on hunting with dogs.

What might young people in Wales have expected from the Queen's speech? What have they got? They may have hoped for a Bill to remove age discrimination from the benefits system, so that 16 and 17-year-olds were entitled to the same income support as others—and to the jobseeker's allowance if they can get it. It is hard enough for them to gain access to those benefits; if they are entitled to them, they should receive the same payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the youth in the hon. Gentleman's constituency of Ceredigion welcome the 83 per cent. drop in youth unemployment there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The youth in my constituency would certainly welcome the opportunity to take part in the new deal. Even more, they would welcome the well paid sustainable work that would result if the Government sometimes listened and started things moving in west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the jobseeker's allowance and the benefits system. Goodness knows, it is hard enough for young people to gain support from the benefits system. For instance, students at Lampeter or Aberystwyth in my constituency, or at Bangor, Cardiff or Swansea, might have expected the Government to have woken up at last to the unjust impact of tuition fees on higher education and to have brought forward a Bill to abolish that pernicious tax on knowledge. But that is not in the Queen's speech, despite the fact that everyone knows that students living in college commonly have debts of as much as £14,000 after three years, and that some higher education institutions now have a drop-out rate of 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people may have hoped to receive an equal minimum wage; it would have been a useful step forward, but that is not in the Queen's speech either. The Secretary of State for Wales referred to some of the problems created by disaffection among young people in rural and urban areas, and some of the ideas in the crime Bill are to be welcomed—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The real difficulty with the crime Bill is not the positive measures that were mentioned in the Queen's speech but the fact that young people will be threatened with a curfew if, in desperation, they find something to do—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Committee is cheering the arrival of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik). It is too much to expect the Liberals to be on time, Mr. Jones; I shall wait for the hon. Gentleman to regain his breath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The young people of Wales will be disappointed that a street curfew should be suggested as an answer to their disaffection. The Government will have a great deal of explaining to do if they want young people to be part of the political process. It is not right to say that if they are disaffected or unhappy with what is going on, a curfew should be imposed on them.

Plain Cymru welcomes the Bill that will set up the Children's Commissioner.

The Children's Commissioner in Wales must be able to deal with important issues. The Government decided to allow child carers—in Wales as well as England—to smack children in their care and to smoke in front of them. I hope that the new commissioner in Wales will have the power to change that—I emphasise that, although it may not be party policy. On a personal level, I want that to change.

Finally, I note the failure of the present devolution model, and of the glorious display in the shop window with its extensive wrapping paper, the ribbon and the tag saying, "To the people of Wales: our plans for your government. Love and kisses, new Labour". When we pick up the box, we find that it is very light. We shake it, but there is no sound, no rattle, no sign of movement. We open it and it is full of flannel, nothing else.

This afternoon in another place—Cardiff—my party will launch its own plans for the future of government in Wales. We shall make it clear where we stand on self-government and full national status. Is it not time that the Government set out their proposals for the devolution process in Wales?

A small, easily passed census amendment Bill should have been in the Queen's Speech so that the citizens of Wales, whatever their ethnic background, could state that they were Welsh next April, before the likely date of the general election.

I was provoked by the right hon. Member for Ynys Môn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not right hon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seem to be so many right hons. these days, especially on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Môn properly mentioned the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, which I have not read. I do not know whether he had a good point, because we are never told the consequences for the pensioners of Wales of the policy of full national status. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) argued for that policy; the hon. Member for Ynys Môn also wanted full national status, but within the European Union, which makes more sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion should tell the pensioners of Wales the consequences for them of full national status. We have heard nothing about the nationalists' economic policies, but we know that there would be a shortfall in respect of expenditure and taxation in Wales of about one third. In simple terms, a one-third reduction in public expenditure would mean a one-third cut in pensions. It is the hon. Gentleman's prerogative to have a policy of full national status, but he should state the economic consequences of that clearly expressed policy for the pensioners of Wales, perhaps in a speech or in one of his 	<i>News of the World</i> articles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about a lower national insurance payment, but where will the money come from for such a policy? It must come from somewhere, but how could there be a lower national insurance payment in Wales when it is part of a single market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the Minister has been pursuing the matter, but he will find it difficult, not only in London but in Brussels, if that policy is introduced, because at the end of the day there will be a shortfall. If Wales is part of the United Kingdom, that shortfall can be made up, but if Wales is not part of Britain—that is the policy of the right hon. Gentleman and his party—who will make it up? I think we should be told.

Off-the-cuff statements were made about the Barnett formula, but it is not perfect and it should perhaps be opened up for further debate. I remind hon. Members that one of the people who would like us to open up the Barnett formula is the Mayor of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an avid reader of the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> when I have nothing else to do. It recently carried an article on a report produced for the Corporation of London by a firm of consultants—I assume, therefore, that it was reasonably correct. It stated that the gross domestic product of London exceeds that of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg or Sweden, in spite of the disparaging remarks about booming London and the south-east. The GDP of London is enormous. The report also points out a so-called surplus of £17 billion a year, which is probably £1 billion more than the total public expenditure in Wales. London provides a surplus of £17 billion a year to the British Exchequer. Londoners say that they need that money because London has poor public education, terrible housing problems for those on low wages, and awful transport difficulties. As money is needed to cure the problems, they ask why they should give away a surplus of £17 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fine for the hon. Member for Ceredigion to open up the Barnett formula, but he will have to deal with such arguments. He will also have to say how he will make up the shortfall of £5 billion or so in the Welsh economy, given his party's policy of breaking up Britain, under which none of the London money would ever come into Wales. It is no good him shaking his head. If he wants to intervene I will be delighted to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is mixing up two matters. If he wants to defend the United Kingdom, he must accept the Barnett formula or some formula similar to that of the European Union on regional distribution from rich areas to poor ones. It is fair enough for him to say that the Barnett formula is inadequate if he wants, but the matter is open to question in discussion of wider issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of debating wider issues. I said that there may be a case for opening up the Barnett formula in the UK, but others will make bids. We should not throw out a half-argument about how terrible the Barnett formula is. If it were opened up, Wales might be even worse off than it is now. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Ceredigion will presumably not be around to contribute to the argument. So far as he is concerned, there will not be a Britain or a British Exchequer, and Wales will operate on its own with taxation that it raises. If that is not his policy, perhaps he should say what is. Is his

policy a sort of Catalonian blackmail, in which Wales stays in Britain but tries to blackmail the other countries in the UK?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not going to pursue the hon. Gentleman's points, and I think that I shall stop. Before the general election, perhaps the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley)—as a member of the Privy Council, he will know more than most people—will tell us how he will make up the shortfall when Wales leaves Britain and joins Europe.

I welcome the commitment to the national health service. It is no good Opposition Members laughing at the phrase "boom and bust". There has been stable, non-inflationary economic growth during the past two or three years. Without such growth, how shall we devote resources to public services such as the national health service? Vast sums are being spent on the health service. It will take time for the results to be seen; such sums cannot be spent overnight, but the money is there and is coming to Wales, but I do not think that Wales has the flexible structures necessary to ensure that money goes quickly to those who need it and that decisions are accountable. We can talk about devolution and support the Assembly and democratic structures. As in the UK generally, the problem in Wales is that so much of government is outside democratic accountability and control. It is outside the accountability of the Assembly and of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it is unfortunate that the reconfiguration of the health trusts was pushed through before the Assembly came into being? The Assembly would have been in a far better position to reconfigure them, and thereby provide a better and cheaper service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about that. To use the jargon, I would like to see some "reconfiguration" and will try to argue for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives bequeathed not only underfunding in the national health service in Wales but an extremely undemocratic structure. That is true outside the health service as well. Baroness Thatcher talked about rolling back the frontiers of the state, and she may have done so in some respects, but with regard to the administration of public services, all that she achieved was the lessening of accountability at the frontiers of the state—a lessening of transparency to the democratic process in Wales and the whole United Kingdom. My right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly called for a bonfire of the quangos. That may have been unrealistic. It has never happened, as far as I can see. Things have certainly not improved. They are getting worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if my right hon. Friend mentioned quangos in the paper that seems to excite the Welsh National party, but the bonfire of the quangos was never even started. Perhaps we should start again— not necessarily with a bonfire, but certainly with a thorough examination of what needs to be done towards proper devolution of democratic Government in Wales. All that I see is quangos that are partners of other quangos and agencies that are partners of other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
agencies. All of them result in a proliferation of committees and sub-committees, and spawn facilitators, rapporteurs, convenors and various others. There is concern among people in Wales about where the money is going. Perhaps it is getting through, but people are worried that the plethora of committees, quangos and next-steps agencies is having a deleterious effect on the distribution of funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the health service we inherited, for the most part, a structure that was established with the internal market. The internal market established various institutions, one of which would send an invoice to another, which would send a cheque back. The prices on the invoices were artificial and managed, and an enormous bureaucracy managed that so-called internal market. Our party has on the whole done away with the internal market, but we have not addressed our minds—and a Government cannot do everything in their first three years—to the structure of the health service, much of which owes its existence to that internal market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a small district general hospital in my constituency, but an amazing number of bodies are involved with it. We have the Dyfed Powys health authority, which has an interest. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned reconfiguration; the Carmarthenshire hospital trust looks after the hospital and one or two other hospitals. The primary care group, something set up under the present Government, also has concerns relating to the local hospital. The Commission for Health Improvement, which may be a good thing, has also been concerned with it. Apparently, the district auditor examines the structures of the health authority and the hospital trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Body after body and committee after committee are involved. Why on earth cannot small district hospitals in Wales be accountable directly to the Assembly—to the Health and Social Services Secretary and the civil service of the Assembly? It is not necessary for all those different bodies to deal with smaller hospitals in Wales. Perhaps the Assembly and the House can work in partnership to change the arrangements.

The people of Llanelli, like people in other areas, collected money for a hospice. They collected enough to build it, but could not collect enough to cover the revenue costs of about £500,000 a year. I took a deputation to see Jane Hutt, the Health and Social Services Secretary, about providing more money, as a result of the Chancellor's announcements. She was helpful and I do not criticise her, but of course she had to hand over most of the money to the Dyfed Powys health authority, which took the decisions according to its own priorities. That authority is not accountable to the people of Llanelli. It does not take its decisions in a transparent way. The people of Llanelli, for good or ill, would like some of the money to be spent on the hospice, but they cannot make their case to a bureaucratic body, because that body is not accountable to them, not subject to elections, and at the end of the day can ignore their wishes.

Talking of Dyfed Powys, the first task that we should perform in the next Parliament is to get rid of the health authorities in Wales. They are completely unnecessary. Hon. Members may have heard me talk about this before, but I must mention it again. Dyfed Powys health authority placed an advertisement in 	<i>The Guardian</i>—naturally—for a deputy chief executive. I apologise, I am not altogether correct: a firm of management consultants in Hertfordshire placed the advertisement. I do not know why it was necessary to employ a firm of management consultants in Hertfordshire to place an advertisement for a deputy chief executive of Dyfed Powys health authority. I must say that the Welsh translation is excellent— somebody managed to translate the jargon in the English part of the advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we are told that the salary will be £70,000. Perhaps that does not seem a large sum from a London perspective, but in an area where incomes are low and are being depressed because of competition, it is a lot of money. It is certainly a lot of money when people are not sure what the functions of the health authorities are, or how they relate to the health services that they get in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the £70,000, the advertisement is amazing. It is full of the management jargon that we have come to expect. That may be all right for the private sector, but it has no place in the public sector. We are told that
	<br><blockquote><p>The incumbent will have considerable space to write his or her job description.</p></blockquote>
What a marvellous job: one gets paid £70,000 per year and one writes one's own job description. On the basis of that phrase I suspect that there was no clearly defined job in the first place. The way in which the advertisement is phrased in general bears that out. The person who wrote it must have a lively imagination. We are told that the job is one of
	<br><blockquote><p>paradoxes which must be managed.</p></blockquote>
The Welsh translation of that phrase is very good—I would not have liked to attempt to translate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are given a list of those paradoxes. I will not list them all, but the successful applicant for the job must
	<br><blockquote><p>Contain expenditure—but spend new money wisely.</p></blockquote>
He or she must also "listen to stakeholders". I do not know who those stakeholders are—certainly not the people who use the health services in Llanelli. Other organisations and groups are stakeholders, but not, apparently, the people who use the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The successful applicant must also
	<br><blockquote><p>Deliver quality—where quality is what the customer says it is.</p></blockquote>
Again, that is a strange way of putting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to have these health authorities? They are struggling to find work for themselves. That is not a criticism of the people who work for them, who, I am sure, do their job conscientiously. The structure is wrong, and we need to do something about it. I understand that the party hierarchy is looking for radical ideas for the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
I learned my Latin at Carmarthen grammar school, and "radical" means "going to the root", so let us start reform at the root of the whole quango state in Wales, and not just the health service. We can work in partnership with the Assembly. It may be necessary to introduce some primary legislation. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon and the hon. Member for Ceredigion want the Assembly to have legislative powers. That is their prerogative, but if we want more democracy in Wales, let us first examine the huge areas of expenditure in Wales that are outside of democratic accountability. Let us try to bring them under the control of the Assembly and the House and work together to promote legislation that will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, local government also is losing its traditional place as a bulwark of local democracy. My saying that may imply criticism of some things that the Government have done. I am amazed at the number of local authorities that now have cabinets. We have a Cabinet here, and that is seen as the old politics of Westminster. I am not an historian, although I understand that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is a distinguished historian who went to an elitist university to learn history. My understanding from doing O-level history in Carmarthen years ago is that Walpole invented the cabinet system and the concept of primus inter pares. Now everyone wants to be a primus. I do not know about the pares. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon really wanted to be a primus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Primus Thomas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to be a primus, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the cabinet system in local government and said that everyone wanted it. Is it the Government's policy to force a cabinet system, or something similar, on local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is something that we should be very careful about. Since we are looking at radicalising, modernising measures, let us get rid of the old-fashioned Walpolean system of the cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government of Wales Act 1998, which established the Assembly, was drafted in a sophisticated way, achieving a balance between the old politics of a cabinet and a wider committee system. I consider the legislation very well drafted. However, my right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly wanted a cabinet, the right hon. Member for Caernarfon wanted one—he obviously had visions of a black car and a red box—and somehow even the Conservatives wanted one, because Lord Roberts moved the amendment to the Bill in the House of Lords that allowed a cabinet system. All the people who wanted a new politics were desperate for a cabinet system in the Assembly. Now we have moved on to a cabinet system in local government. The effect of such a system, as hon. Members know, is very often a reduction in the power of ordinary councillors and a feeling that local democracy has been compromised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech was excellent, and the money that is to come to the health service and other services in Wales is welcome, and badly needed. We should

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
examine the structure of government and think about democratic accountability. It is not necessarily our fault that we do not have that, but if we want to be radical and modernising, our next step should be along the road to greater democracy in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward to the Labour party's return to its roots, when it goes on a quest for radical policies for the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome today's debate, but it might have been more appropriate and timely to discuss the pre-Budget report in the previous Session of Parliament, when it was presented, and to debate the Queen's Speech today or tomorrow. Perhaps the lack of significant legislative material has led to it being deemed necessary to combine the two matters. I shall deal with the Queen's Speech, particularly in relation to Wales and the question of a Children's Commissioner, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), if he is lucky enough to catch your eye later, Mr. Jones, will deal with the pre-Budget statement and the state of the Welsh economy. Of course, despite three and a half years of the wonderful new Labour Government, my hon. Friend is still struggling through the floods and the transport chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for the Children's Commissioner are the most important aspect of the Queen's Speech for Wales. My view of the Children's Commissioner is clear. For two years, I was a member of the Select Committee on Health. Its second report of this Parliament, on "Children Looked After by Local Authorities", recommended that a Children's Rights Commissioner be established within the UK
	<br><blockquote><p>to ensure that the needs of children—including children looked after—are taken seriously at the heart of Government.</p></blockquote>
As a member of that Select Committee, I heard evidence from people who had suffered from child abuse. It was not only my most harrowing experience as a Member of Parliament, but probably the most harrowing of my whole life. Victims of child abuse suffer their scars for the rest of their lives. I heard people in their 50s and 60s recounting their horrendous experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Health Committee report stated that children's commissioners were needed throughout the UK. Today, 36,000 children are on the child protection register and at least one child dies of abuse or neglect every week. Children would be better protected if commissioners were appointed throughout the UK to highlight problems within existing systems, to make recommendations for change and to press the Government to act on proposals made by various child abuse inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions in the rest of the UK are, of course, beyond the scope of this morning's debate, but I want to clear up misunderstandings about the Conservative position on the Children's Commissioner for Wales as we look forward to future legislation. We believe that it is appropriate and desirable for the Children's Commissioner to look after children in the care of local authorities and other bodies. However, the rights
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
of such a commissioner should not be extended to supplant the role of parents, who are the natural advocates of their children's interests in the vast majority of cases. Parents should not be undermined. Although we have not yet had the opportunity to see it in detail, the legislation could do that. A Children's Commissioner should be involved in caring for children who are looked after by statutory services and should also carry out a wider function in relation to children's issues in all Departments of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of information, let me inform the hon. Gentleman that I moved an amendment along those lines during the passage of the Local Government Bill in 1993. Unfortunately, his party dispatched it to the bin without any further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that point of information. I was not responsible for Government policy during that debate; I was not even a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost uniquely in society, children form a group that cannot take part in the democratic process. We make legislation and regulations that affect them directly through statutory provisions and indirectly through legislation to support the family. It is therefore appropriate that the person who has the remit to examine legislation across the range of Departments and to represent the interests of children is independent because that will ensure that those interests will be properly taken into account in the workings of Government and in the legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise that there is no conflict between my view and that of my colleagues in the Welsh Assembly. David Melding, speaking for the Conservative group in the Welsh Assembly, tabled an amendment on 7 June. The amendment—No. 2 on that day's Order Paper—stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>After point 1 insert the following point and renumber subsequent points:—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very illuminating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get it right for the record. The amendment continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>2. asserts the importance of the family in protecting and nurturing children and therefore believes that the remit of the Children's Commissioner should relate exclusively to children's services provided by public and other agencies.</p></blockquote>
That is the position proposed by my colleagues in Cardiff, and it is also ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman will tell me that that amendment was not passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was going to make a simple point. A great deal of child abuse occurs within families. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that his proposed wording appears to limit the role of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Children's Commissioner in a way that could be dangerous? If so, will he reconsider his position and that of his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and I shall further clarify our point. Children who are abused within families end up on child protection registers. Their cases should be considered by social services, and the Children's Commissioner should examine them once they enter the remit of the statutory authority. What is a question—we have yet to see the legislation—is whether the role of the Children's Commissioner should extend to all children, rather than only to those who are at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the voices of children—whether they are in families, in a regulated social services setting or cared for by the health service—must be heard, and that it is the commissioner's job to listen? Even if those children are in a family, it is still important that their voices be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is particularly important that somebody is there for children who are the victims of abuse in a family setting. Whether the social services department or the Children's Commissioner oversee that role, those children should, of course, be heard. However, it is not the role of the Children's Commissioner to regulate family life. That point is an appropriate caveat to future, as yet unseen, legislation. When we scrutinise that legislation, we shall seek to ensure that the Children's Commissioner's remit does not extend to regulating family life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being very revealing about his party's policy. He talks about children who have been abused, but has he taken into account that the Children's Commissioner must look after the general welfare of children? For example, child carers who smoke have an impact on children's health. What about discussions in the National Assembly on 20 mph speed limits outside schools? Is there not a wider remit for the Children's Commissioner than that outlined by the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried by the suggestion that the Children's Commissioner should consider smoking by child carers, because that would mean considering smoking by parents. Parental responsibilities are my concern in this case. There is a danger that we might take our eyes off the main ball, which is child abuse, and start delving into social engineering, which should not be the role of the Children's Commissioner or of the National Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An abused child could appeal to the Children's Commissioner—whom we hope will have a high-profile role—before having contact with any other agency. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
commissioner could fulfil such a role? The commissioner would be not interfering in families but answering a child's cry for help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an interesting point, but the Children's Commissioner should not act as gatekeeper for social services. Such responsibilities belong to the social services themselves, and to other agencies such as education, which have direct contact with the child. The Children's Commissioner might consider it necessary to set up a body akin to Childline, which is a telephone service for children who believe that they are being abused but, as a statutory official, the commissioner should not become directly involved in individual cases in the first instance, given that agencies are already in place to deal with such matters. Nevertheless, it would be perfectly appropriate for him to express an opinion, or even to establish structures that might allow those agencies to detect and deal with evidence of child abuse more quickly and effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I agree that the first port of call for such children should be the statutory services, but there have been many missed cases of abuse in Wales and, in such circumstances, there must be a role for the commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of expressing an opinion on how cases are missed, there certainly is a role for the commissioner. Such a role would help to create a more effective means of monitoring those child abuse cases that are not being picked up at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of my argument is that the child abuse cases that are in the forefront of our minds involved children in residential care: children who were already being looked after by the very social services departments that are supposed to detect child abuse in the first instance. As I have said, we should not take our eye off the ball. The most pressing concern for the commissioner should be children in institutional care or on local authority registers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "Lost in Care" report revealed appalling abuses of children in care that must never be allowed to happen again. A future Conservative Government would co-operate closely with the National Assembly to ensure that the Children's Commissioner for Wales is a fully effective post. If the timing had been slightly different, and had the Government not promised this legislation—which we have yet to see—a future Conservative Government would have ensured that services affecting children were properly monitored by making time early in a new Parliament to provide for the major statutory powers that this legislation will apparently introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of Waterhouse's comments about the duties of the Children's Commissioner. Page 214 of his report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The duties of the Commissioner should include:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) ensuring that children's rights are respected through the monitoring and oversight of the operation of complaints and whistleblowing procedures and the arrangements for children's advocacy;—</p></blockquote>
that is an oversight role—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) examining the handling of individual cases brought to the Commissioner's attention (including making recommendations on the merits) when he considers it necessary and appropriate to do so;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) publishing reports, including an annual report to the National Assembly for Wales.</p></blockquote>
I agree with the Waterhouse report's recommendation on inspection, on page 223, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Without prejudice to the continuing role generally of the Social Services Inspectorate for Wales</p></blockquote>
the Children's Commissioner should be
	<br><blockquote><p>charged with the responsibility of inspecting:
	<ol>
	<li>all local authority, voluntary and private children's homes;</li>
	<li>the welfare provision in residential schools;</li>
	<li>fostering services; and</li>
	<li>the other components of children's services.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Essentially, the Children's Commissioner will deal with the public sector statutory services that are provided for children, not with what happens in children's own homes after a case of child abuse has been suspected or established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that society should protect the interests of all children, especially those who are disadvantaged and are in the care of local authorities. The problems of child abuse—whether mental, physical or sexual—were highlighted by the cases in the Waterhouse report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I missed the beginning of the hon. Gentleman's speech. The provision of protection for children who find themselves in difficult circumstances is an interesting and important aspect of the work of the Children's Commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman's concern about the commissioner becoming involved in family relationships based on a model from elsewhere in the world, or is it merely an unsubstantiated fear at the back of his mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is a fear that will be allayed when the Under-Secretary winds up the debate, or, if not then, when we see the Bill in the Vote Office. At the moment, we fear that the role of the Children's Commissioner will be extended beyond that which is envisaged in the legislation, with which we have no quarrel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are especially keen that the Children's Commissioner should deal with the failures of local authorities. The passing of the Care Standards Act 2000 and the appointment of the Children's Commissioner should be the start of significant progress. We should have a commissioner who will champion children in care, ensuring that people whom the community entrusts with discharging their duties as carers do so effectively, properly and beyond any form of criticism, and that people entrusted by society carry out their duties as caring parents in any normal family relationship. The Queen's Speech implied that the Government intend the Children's Commissioner to be an ombudsman for all children. That may sound good, particularly for children, but is it realistic? What will happen to parents' role in bringing up their children? Do we want a nanny state to supervise the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
caring, natural way in which we rear our children? Conservative Members support the role of parents, who are the natural advocates for the interests of their children in the vast majority of families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sorry for interrupting the hon. Gentleman's vacuous speech. Has he forgotten the Fred West case? Many children would have appreciated a nanny in Gloucester and in many parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have not forgotten the Fred West case, but I do not want to analyse every case of criminality to justify an all-embracing, overarching commissioner who knocks on every door to check that everyone is all right. That would be silly, but the Labour party seems to be returning to its roots and the nanny approach in a radical agenda is what we expected from the old Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the end of my speech and want to make progress. I have been generous in giving way to Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong if the new legislation undermined the way in which parents look after the best interests of their offspring. It is the duty of all parents to empower their children with a feeling of personal responsibility that passes from one generation to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point of instilling pride in a child, is the hon. Gentleman aware that, under the Conservative Government, child poverty trebled in Wales? It is difficult to instil pride and confidence if the family has been racked by unemployment for generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could answer that question at considerable length, but we are discussing the Queen's Speech, so I shall limit my comments to that. Perhaps we can have another debate on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we scrutinise the Bill, we shall try to ensure that the responsibilities of parents are not undermined. The Conservative party believes in personal responsibility within families, wholesome families within the community, and a positive community within a united country that is supportive and respectful of family responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An independent Children's Commissioner should have the remit to examine legislative proposals throughout a range of Departments and wholeheartedly to represent the interests of children who will be affected by the legislation. The commissioner must be able to deal with any ineffectiveness or injustice to children in corporate care, so that their interests are properly taken into account and the workings of government and local government is more accountable. The commissioner should ensure that any complaints and investigations are dealt with quickly, firmly and fairly. He should cross-fertilise best practice in the best interests of our children to ensure that inter-agency reviews and procedures are followed and updated quickly in today's ever-changing circumstances. He must ensure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
vigilance and best standards in recruitment of staff and approval of foster parents. He must be the godfather of all children in care. We are at one with the Government and the Welsh Assembly in the belief that those powers should be statutory, but we must allow parents to set good practice and to bring out the best in their children with encouragement and the common-sense Conservative principle of empowering the family without unnecessary Government imposition. We owe that to our children and future generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) for introducing the precise role of the Children's Commissioner, because it is important. However, I wish that he had not hypocritically projected his party as the only custodian of children's interests. With all due respect, he came across as a pompous advocate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He talked sanctimonious piffle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. Anyone would think that the Conservatives had never been in power and that there was no Conservative Government when abuse was taking place in children's homes in Wales. The hon. Gentleman talked claptrap. However, I am grateful that he referred to the precise role of the Children's Commissioner. As a father of four and grandfather of 12, I have a particular interest in the welfare of children, as does everyone else, and that interest is not exclusive to myself or my party. I do not want the Children's Commissioner to usurp the role of statutory authorities; I want him to ensure that those authorities work effectively, because that has not happened in the past, regardless of which party was in power. Parties of all political hues have tried to deal with the problem of abuse, which often occurs in families. When children have had to be removed and put into residential homes, they have not always been properly looked after and may have been abused when in our care. When we refer to social services and children being abused in homes, we are referring to our social services and our residential homes. We fail as politicians if we do not ensure that structures are in place to look after those vulnerable children. It is our responsibility and I want the Children's Commissioner to work effectively. Structures exist, but they must be made to work properly for the sake of the children concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not wise of the hon. Member for Ceredigion to refer to the proposals in the Queen's Speech as Christmas baubles and trinkets. I wanted other measures to be included in the Queen's Speech, but it covered the Children's Commissioner, education, child care and health, which are not baubles or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
trinkets. When we have got the economy and industry right, we shall not continually tinker with them. We have so many structures in Wales that we shall collapse under them. This is the stage in any Government to improve the quality of life and the measures that we are discussing will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of your stricture, Mr. Jones. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will introduce some of the measures that I wanted but that were not in the Queen's Speech. I am confused about who does what to whom in Wales and I am sure not sure how matters will proceed. Many people are asking for more power for the Welsh Assembly, but it only just managed to obtain its present powers. If people such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) want to open the Pandora's box of the Barnett formula and increase the powers of the Welsh Assembly, the people of Wales might like to contribute to the debate on that. The hon. Member for Ceredigion is nodding—does that mean that he would like another referendum? After one year of the Welsh Assembly, my constituents, at least, are saying that they would like another referendum, and I have no doubt how the people of Wales would vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State raise with the Welsh Assembly the issue of support for indigenous industries? The Welsh Development Agency makes much of inward investment, but many of us know that indigenous and small industries in valley communities and rural areas do not get the support that is given to incoming industries with much higher profiles. As a result, jobs are being lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the forthcoming Bill on homes, which will contribute to the development of our homes infrastructure, but I ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to raise with the Welsh Assembly the issue of housing repair grants and the availability of money for refurbishment of older houses. Such funds have been cut, and my local authority is having severe problems providing housing repair grants and support for people who live in older, valley communities. That matter must be addressed urgently.

I hope that we will not go down the path of fully integrating into mainstream schools children with special educational needs. There are great virtues in maintaining the existing relationship between children who need extra care and those who—dare I say it—lead a normal life. For those of us who are fortunate enough to have all our senses, it is good to be in touch every day with those who are less fortunate, but in certain educational situations such children can place a tremendous strain on classroom teachers. If we are to integrate children with special educational needs into mainstream education, appropriate resources must be provided. There must be more care assistants, and more support in the classroom for the teachers who must do this difficult work. In the meantime, we should retain the special schools that do such a wonderful job in our communities. Parents of handicapped children in my constituency are eternally grateful to the Rhondda special school, which has done a great job over many years in helping children with special educational needs.

I welcome the extended new deal for disabled people, which was proposed in the pre-Budget report. However, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will discuss with our colleagues in the Department for Education and Employment their attitude towards sheltered workshops, which were set up to aid the blind and others who find it difficult to secure normal employment. Resources are being cut off, and the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), who represents a London constituency, are arguing that the disabled must be integrated into mainstream industrial activity. That is a wonderful idea when the jobs are there, but when they are not, it is the disabled who suffer, because their productivity is deemed not good enough. They need the cushion that sheltered workshops provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli: we are grossly over-governed in Wales. Yet again, government must be reorganised so that resources can get through. I understand that English local authorities have received certain moneys that are still held up by a logjam in Wales because the necessary provisions cannot get through the Committees of the Welsh Assembly quickly enough. I suggest that, instead of beginning at 9.35 in the morning and finishing at 12.35, they start working full time to get rid of the logjam of secondary legislation that it is their job to carry out. It is no good their asking for more powers when they are not even doing the job that they were elected to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with considerable interest to the hon. Gentleman's criticisms of the Lib-Lab Government in Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion on his excellent opening speech. The programme that the Government outlined in the Queen's Speech is limited and thin. It is clear that a general election is on the way. However, we have until May 2002, so I cannot understand the rush and panic. What are the Government running away from? Is there bad news around the corner that we do not yet know about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal mainly with the economy, but I want to mention a couple of other matters first. I greatly welcome some features of the Queen's Speech, such as the Children's Commissioner for Wales Bill, the Bill to ban the advertising of tobacco, which is long overdue, and—subject to seeing more detail—the Bill on leasehold reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the First Minister said on Friday, the Queen's Speech includes four Bills—in addition to the children's Bill—with specifically Welsh provisions. The Secretary of State mentioned three of those four Bills. I hope that they will be flexible enough to enable the National Assembly for Wales to develop policy in line with the needs of Wales while making more imaginative use of our secondary legislative powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
The Queen's Speech could have covered some additional matters. For example, all hon. Members with maritime constituencies will be aware of the pressure for legislation to control jet skis and power craft. That has been discussed by a cross-departmental working party of which the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) was a member. There have been signals of an intention to legislate, but it has not yet happened. I would have thought that such a small piece of legislation could be included. I would also have welcomed a statement that responsibility for the census will be transferred to the National Assembly, given the difficulties that have arisen in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economy was little mentioned in the Queen's Speech. That suggests that there may be a danger of complacency and that the Government believe that everything in the garden is rosy. That is not the message from the steel industry, farming, rural post offices and people with screwdriver-type jobs who are paid a pittance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In objective 1 areas, the main challenge is to raise gross domestic product per head. That involves three factors: reducing unemployment, increasing activity rates and securing better-paid jobs. Unemployment has fallen, which is greatly to be welcomed—although pockets of difficulty remain, on which attention must be focused. However, activity rates have not increased as we had hoped—indeed, some figures point to continuing reductions. Unless we tackle that problem, we will have the devil of a job to increase GDP per head by the necessary amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must secure job quality and ensure that jobs are well paid and sustainable, especially in areas that have experienced a shortage of new jobs. In order to provide such jobs, we must identify the key growth sectors of the economy and equip the work force with the skills that are relevant to those sectors—not only now, but in three, five and 10 years' time. That is quite a planning challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that regard, the role of objective 1 could be central, but there is a danger that we have put the cart before the horse. We should have had a detailed economic strategy before objective 1 status applied. In years gone by, the Welsh Office did not get around to that, and in that regard I look to previous Governments as much as this Government. The Lib-Lab Government in Cardiff are trying to make progress in that direction, but it would have been better if that strategy had been in place before objective 1 status. As a result, we could have had a more coherent approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the important points made by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers), we are still affected by the problems that arose from the Treasury's failure fully to fund objective 1. During the coming year, serious knock-on effects will be felt in the education sector and in the level of housing expenditure in Wales. We must find £180 million a year from within the Welsh block to match-fund objective 1, which inevitably means that less money will be available for other services. We welcome the Lib-Lab Government in Cardiff's safeguarding of next year's health sector spending. However, that means that there will be a lower increase
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
in education and housing expenditure in Wales than in England. As a direct result of underfunding of match funding in the Barnett formula, schools in Wales will be unable to get the same ring-fenced resources as English schools. That problem is caused by the interplay between European money and the Barnett formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing is a serious problem. Council house tenants are waiting too long for repairs, and some owner-occupiers have been waiting years for renovation grants. They now face the prospect of waiting even longer, or perhaps never getting them. Housing relates to other critical areas, such as health, education and social patterns, so we must get it right. Let no one in Wales be under any misapprehension that those problems are the direct result of the underfunding of match funding for objective 1 in the Barnett formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make objective 1 work effectively, we need operating aids within the objective 1 areas. In particular, we need the ability to vary corporation tax and national insurance in those areas. The Lib-Lab Government in Cardiff are actively seeking those powers and, as Plaid Cymru members, we shall support them in that. Incidentally, a former Secretary of State for Wales tried to move the matter forward a couple years ago, which is one example of how the Nice Euro-summit relates directly to Wales. The UK Government have secured confirmation that both taxation and social security are matters for member states, not the EU. It is for the Labour Government in London to deliver what the Lib-Lab Government in Cardiff are seeking—or to deny it, as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my mind, there is no question of a trade distortion occurring, as some people in Brussels have suggested. If a member state can vary tax or national insurance payments without distorting trade, there is that much less of an argument when variation occurs in a region of a member state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's suggestion to vary corporation tax intrigues me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am saying that the variation should apply to the other three objective 1 areas: Merseyside, Cornwall and South Yorkshire.

In relation to the autumn statement, I want to discuss the critical effect of the high price of diesel in many rural areas. In a village in my constituency, diesel currently costs 92p per litre, which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
devastating. That is hitting hauliers and, as a consequence, most rural businesses, especially hard. Two weeks ago, I met some hauliers from my constituency, one of whom had a fleet of 12 lorries. The increase in the price of diesel in the past year alone is costing him an additional £100,000 and he is now running at a loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Accepting the right hon. Gentleman's figures, how much of that increase is related to world prices, and how much is additional duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the most recent increase of 5p a litre was related to world prices. Hauliers are being hit by a combination of factors, and what is needed is a mechanism that will establish stability and a fair and level playing field. Hauliers are paying much more than their counterparts in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, for example. It is interesting to note that last week's Irish budget reduced duty in the Irish Republic. As a result, those in Ireland who bring their lorries to Wales will find such work even more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The autumn statement inadequately attacked the basic problem of poverty. Many members of the Committee will agree that poverty affects many parts of Wales and must be regarded as a priority. The Irish budget to which I referred increased the income tax threshold to £7,000. As a result, 38 per cent, of the Irish work force will not pay income tax. Such a threshold increase is needed in the UK as well, so that those on the lowest level of income could be taken out of paying tax. That would directly address the problem of poverty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise in advance, Mr. Jones, for my absence this afternoon, when I shall attend a meeting of the body responsible for relationships with UNICEF. UNICEF co-ordinates the activities of the various children's commissioners throughout Europe, and it is a matter of great pride that I will be able to report that, unlike England, Wales will have a commissioner. During the sanctimonious piffle that we heard from the hon. Member for North Dorset, he forgot to mention that England has no commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pensions, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for his on-going support for early-day motion 1. There is now a second early-day motion, which fairly congratulates the Government on current developments. For all the reservations about yesterday that were expressed by the party of yesterday, we can look forward to good news on pensions. Of the three main Government pension policies, two—the minimum income guarantee and the pension credit— will be increased in line with the top level of inflation. We have yet to convince pensioners, but the money is there and the final victory will be to ensure that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
basic pension is linked to earnings levels. That will give pensioners what they currently lack—certainty that retirement and old age will be a period not of decreasing income, but one in which income will keep up with the true level of inflation. That is not a great deal to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion had a go at me about farming. One of his constituents is a friend of mine—I am tempted to mention his name—whom I have known for 25 years. In the early 1970s, he and a colleague in the environmental movement set up a farm on soil that was apparently too shallow ever to be productive, and his farming neighbours tut-tutted and derided them for farming soil that could never be made to pay. Those farmers thought it terrible joke, but now it is they who are marching and asking for more subsidies. It is they—whose way of life and unique Welsh language we have a vested interest in preserving and supporting—who are in financial trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My farming friend and his colleague, and many others like them, were far-sighted. Because they developed organic farms, they now have turnovers of many millions of pounds. We are in a similar position now. Farmers in Wales are not seeing the future clearly. The hon. Member for Ceredigion is asking for more subsidy for them; he is offering them the same medicine that has caused the present malady. I refer him to a splendid book on the history of the steel industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he is against the present subsidy being paid to farmers to convert to organic farming? What about his earlier comments that he wanted more subsidies in his area to tackle unemployment black spots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not against such subsidies. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman read a chapter of "Baglu Mlaen" which sets out the painful history of the steel industry. When I worked in that industry, it was up to its armpits in subsidies, but it was going from failure to greater failure. The best thing that happened to the industry was the announcement that there would be no more subsidies. The same is true of farming in Canada and New Zealand. Fifteen years after all subsidies ended, New Zealand is now producing food that it can sell in Wales. That food, which is transported around the world, is cheaper than that produced by Welsh farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a point that is not made very often about what has happened to British farming. Over the past 50 years when farmers have had a problem, instead of looking to the marketplace, varying their production to include more useful products and considering alternatives, such as non-food farming uses for the land—all of which would employ more people and make the industry more prosperous—their instinct has been to campaign and lobby Members of Parliament, Members of the Assembly and Europe. That highlights their dependency culture. The best shot in the arm to farmers is to say, "There will be no more subsidies after five years, except for the environment." That would give them an impetus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Last week, I received a call saying that 220 jobs in the aluminium foil industry were to disappear in my constituency because of the strength of the pound and market forces and because the industry could not compete with firms overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that the farmers who campaign and lobby me do not go on about subsidies; they go on about there being a fair marketplace in Europe and say that regulations applied in Europe should apply in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make a comparison between the steel industry and the farming industry. The steel industry is now among the most efficient in the world. It has a large amount of investment, but it has faced real perils. Few of us have fallen into the trap of demanding extra subsidies for it. It has a rosy future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farming industry is wholly dependent. In fact, the Welsh Assembly produced figures showing that the contribution of farming to gross domestic product in Wales, once the subsidies were removed, was nil. In fact, the position is far worse than that, because many of the hidden subsidies, such as the tir mynydd scheme, have not been taken away. We cannot look to a future where people in industry carry the farmers around on their backs. All industries must be self-sufficient. The many present diversifications in farming are encouraging, but the only way to ensure a prosperous rural area is to ensure that farmers go into alternative forms of production that have a future. We cannot have one policy for dealing with market forces in one area and say, "You must be victims of market forces," and say to another part of industry, "You are to be recipients of handouts for all time." There must be some realisation that that takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech is a good news story for the people of Wales. We have a strong economy. In the 1950s and 1960s, Wales enjoyed several years of full employment; now there are many pockets of Wales where the situation is even better than that. Unemployment in those regions is at a level below what we once regarded as full employment. That is a great achievement, but we tend to talk about the issues of our time rather than the genuine strength of our economy. We have a good new story to tell in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made a point in an intervention about the problems of the distortions in the Welsh economy. The objective 1 project is a great achievement for the Government and the Labour party in the National Assembly which will benefit many areas of the country. However, I appeal to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to consider the map in his conversations with the Assembly and when he is taking decisions. Although it was created for good reasons, it represents a crude distortion of deprivation in Wales. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon said that it was drafted prematurely; I thought that he would make the point that it was drafted before the Assembly produced the index of deprived wards in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The index of deprivation tells a different story. Ceredigion and Conwy are included in objective 1 areas—and good luck to them. However, not a single
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
one of the 100 wards in Wales with the worst indications of deprivation is in Conwy or Ceredigion. There are wards in those two areas that need support and help, but we should compare their situation with urban areas of Wales such as Wrexham, Cardiff and Newport. Four wards in my constituency are in the first 100 and some are in the first 20 of the most deprived wards in Wales, but those and many other wards in urban areas will not get a single penny of objective 1 money. That will create a further distortion, as will the distribution of money for the police in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we take such decisions, we must ensure that we are not influenced by the clamorous voices of those who write to us almost daily, who campaign and make a great deal of fuss and have the press and media on their side. In my book about things that a Member of Parliament should do, I laid down 10 commandments; one of those was that we should listen to the silent voices. We should listen to the silent voices in care homes and of children mistreated by their parents or grandparents—that is what the Care Standards Act 2000 aims to achieve. Other voices in Wales are much too silent; we should hear more from people in industrial areas and the valleys whose voices are, if not silent, at least muted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by blaming the current and former Governments for my lateness. I had things to do last night in my constituency and thought that I would be early enough if I got up at 4 am this morning—but evidently not, as everyone else has decided to abandon public transport and drive. However, I suspect that there is a plot here somewhere. Not satisfied with blocking the M40, the Government regard the Liberal Democrats as such a threat that they detained everyone on the M4 simply to prevent my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) from arriving. However, we have not been deterred—we have made it anyway. I thank the Committee for its indulgence, and all hon. Members for showing their unbridled happiness at the fact that we have made it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay meant that I had plenty of time to consider the word "radical" on the way down. The extent to which the public see that radical solutions are being found is a crucial element in the evaluation of how radical a Government are. It is clear from the Queen's Speech and pre-Budget statement, as other hon. Members have said, that the general election is likely to come on 3 May. Will the Secretary of State confirm that date? It would then be easier to plan the months ahead. I believe that I may not, however, receive an answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard the Queen's Speech as aspirational because even the limited agenda that it contains is unlikely to be carried through. I imagine that the Minister has already referred to the fact that five Bills are proposed for this year's programme, which will confer functions to a greater or lesser extent on the Assembly. Those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
include Bills on the Children's Commissioner, health and social care, housing, regulatory reform and special education needs and disabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that his colleagues in the National Assembly have been consulted on those aspects of the Queen's Speech, in relation to the Labour coalition in the Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an odd question. In the spirit of trying to give a meaningful answer, I do not think that the Liberal Democrats or Mike German wrote the Queen's Speech or any significant part of it; nor were they consulted before the statement was made. There is no doubt that, within the partnership, regular dialogue takes place about the consequences of the Queen's Speech, and Liberal Democrat Members at Westminster have discussions with the Assembly group. The main goal of the partnership is to make the provisions in the Queen's Speech work, to the best of our ability, in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going into too much detail, the overriding strategic requirement is that to which the right hon. Member for Caernarfon referred—the need for the Assembly to have maximum flexibility to interpret and implement the consequences of Bills in the best interests of Wales. It should not be too hard for the Minister to provide confirmation in that regard, not least because the UK Government have followed the Assembly's lead, for example, on homelessness. The Queen's Speech included proposed legislation to place a duty on local authorities to house vulnerable people who have recently left institutions such as care homes, prisons and the armed forces. That comes five months after the National Assembly endorsed a Liberal Democrat proposal to designate the same categories of people as being in priority need. That is an example of the reverse flow of legislation—the Assembly guiding the Queen's Speech. To some extent, therefore, I could say to the hon. Member for Ceredigion that, at an embryonic level, the Welsh Assembly can guide best practice at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon, which is even more important in terms of the pre-Budget statement, should be emphasised. The Chancellor said that he was investigating the possibility of fiscal variations for the poorest areas of Britain, which sounds like code for looking into operating aid for objective 1 areas. Corporation tax and national insurance contributions are the most important ways in which that can be done. It is worth remembering that that was very successful in Ireland in 1994–95. In fact, academics regard tax variations as far more significant in regenerating the economy than European Union cash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 status allows regions and member states to attain, through EU competition rules, a degree of fiscal variation. However, I acknowledge that there are hurdles to cross. Europe needs to say yes, and, ultimately, the Chancellor of the Exchequer must underwrite the cost of doing that. Will the Minister confirm that he will do all that he can to assist the Assembly Minister with responsibility for economics
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
in that regard? Incidentally, the Conservatives seem to have a schizophrenic attitude to this matter. In the Welsh Assembly, they said that it was too late to incorporate fiscal variations into objective 1 implementation, apparently because the programme document had already been submitted to Brussels. However, that reveals a fantastically flawed understanding of the process. I hope that the Conservative members of this Committee will counsel their Assembly colleagues to think again. It is not helpful to have conflicting messages coming out of the Assembly when it is in everyone's interests to do a good job with regard to tax breaks under objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not so happy with other aspects of the pre-Budget statement. First, in contradiction of what the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said, we believe that rural areas have once again received the bum's rush. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] Thank you, Mr. Jones, for not bringing me to order on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West takes a cynical attitude to farming. It sounds almost as though he is blaming the farmers for capitalising on their financial environment. Hon. Members should remember that the subsidy system was set up to prevent starvation and maintain agricultural stability after the war. It has become overbearing and complicated, but it has fulfilled its original objective. I agree that it needs reforming, but the hon. Gentleman is being a little harsh in blaming farmers merely for responding to market circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are direct consequences of removing the subsidy: the zero subsidy environments, such as New Zealand, cited by the hon. Member for Newport, West, can result in depopulation of the countryside. It is all very well to take a political approach, but my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and I do not agree with it; a wholesale change would mean that we were willing to accept the depopulation of the countryside because small farms would merge with big ones and a proportion of land might go to seed. Those are not consequences that the Liberal Democrats want and I suspect that the same is true of the members of Plaid Cymru.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even in rural areas, only about 9 per cent, of people work in farming. Has the hon. Gentleman noticed that changing to organic farming and to non-food production, or going out of farming, increases the number of people employed in the countryside? A typical farm in the hon. Gentleman's constituency might consist of several hundred acres and employ one or two people. Changing and modernising farming will greatly increase the prosperity of rural areas and the number of people employed there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman suggests for organic farming and diversification is not inconsistent with making changes gradually and with making a strategic commitment to maintain a working population in the countryside. The size of the average farm is smaller than the hon. Gentleman believes. A much higher proportion of people in rural Wales depend directly or indirectly on the turnover generated by agriculture. Hon. Members with rural constituencies know that that is the case; they know, too, the knock-on effect that the agricultural crisis has had on towns, new towns and communities in Brecon and elsewhere that are heavily dependent on the turnover from farms—the hon. Member for Ceredigion nods—but do not employ farmers primarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are disappointed that there is not more in the Queen's Speech for farmers. The most high-profile element of rural policy relates to fox hunting. It is disappointing that so much time that could be spent discussing serious social, cultural and economic matters in the countryside has been put aside for a peripheral issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about fuel taxation, but the inequity of a fuel price gradient that goes up as one moves from the city to the countryside has not been mentioned. In simple terms, without using jargon, that means that the cost of filling up the petrol tank is highest in the places where private transport is most needed. That cannot be right. The Government have done nothing to tackle the fact that it is cheaper to fill up a car in the centre of a city than it is in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With today's technology and a modicum of planning, the fuel taxes could be altered so that prices go down as one moves towards the rural areas. That has been done elsewhere, and it is not expensive in terms of Government revenue. The Government may find different ways to achieve that aim; all four parties could have a useful debate about the mechanics of such a scheme.
