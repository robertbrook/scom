	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all hon. Members would wish me to express our gratitude to Monmouthshire county council for agreeing to host this sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee. I particularly thank the chairman of Torfaen borough council, which shares the building, and the staff of county hall for making such thorough and efficient arrangements for us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to suspend the Committee for one hour for lunch at about 1 pm. I remind hon. Members of the rules for the use of the Welsh language: they are free to move from one language to another as they choose, provided that those proposing to speak in Welsh give the Chairman notice in English of their intention to do so—at the latest when they are called to speak or to ask a question. Points of order are to be raised only in English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Students (Funding)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he last discussed funding of students' education at further and higher levels with (a) the Secretary of State for Education and (b) the First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales; and if he will make a statement. [152750]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I have regular meetings with ministerial colleagues and Assembly Ministers to discuss a range of issues. The Government are committed to encouraging greater participation in higher and further education that is consistent with the policy on lifelong learning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd </div> <!-- member -->(Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that answer, may I remind the Minister that the most recent figures show that the number of people trying to enter further and higher education in Wales has decreased by 5 per cent., whereas in Scotland in the same period it has increased by 15 per cent? Will he reconsider the policy of forcing students to pay tuition fees, as that undermines the all-important principle of education for all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that tuition continues to be free for students from lower income families. About 45 per cent, of all students do not pay tuition fees and a further 20 per cent. will pay less than the full fee. I recognise that student hardship
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
arises on occasion. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the Assembly's announcement on 5 December that it had commissioned an independent investigation into student hardship, which will examine the issues to which he has referred in relation to the Scottish experience and the Cubie report. I shall reflect with interest on that independent investigation when it is completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the extreme importance of funding further and higher education, is my hon. Friend aware that recent figures show that 20 per cent, of the Welsh working population has no qualifications? In view of that, will he give maximum encouragement to funding the acquisition of qualifications, not only by those who are waiting to go into work, but by those already in employment, and will he give particular encouragement to the Chancellor's idea of a generous tax credit to employers to encourage training in the workplace?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his suggestion. The Chancellor's employment credit policy to which he refers is important. My hon. Friend has consistently encouraged the Government, the Employment Service and agencies under the direction of the Assembly to work closely together to provide improved training, so that individuals can return to work and have their skills increased considerably. The Government and the Assembly are committed to improving the skills of those who do not currently have appropriate skills, and I am sure that we can examine the examples to which he refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the misapprehension that the Scottish deal on tuition fees is a good deal? It costs the Scottish block about £60 million, in return for which it receives, not an end to tuition fees, but a roll-up of tuition fees. All students pay £2,000 at the end of their course, whereas half the students in Wales pay nothing. Implementing the Scottish system would not only cost the Welsh block £30-odd million, but would make students from the poorest backgrounds £2,000 worse off. That does not sound like a good deal to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), tuition continues to be free for approximately 45 per cent. of students, and a further 20 per cent. of students pay a much reduced fee. The points that have been made will form part of the independent investigation by the Assembly, but important lessons are involved: the Scottish experience does not necessarily provide a panacea for further and higher education in Wales. My hon. Friend's points will be considered along with those of the Assembly in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree, despite some cynicism about the settlement in Scotland, that that settlement is a great deal better than what would have occurred had the Liberal Democrats not convinced our Labour partners in Scotland to tackle the issue of tuition fees? Does he

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
support the Welsh Assembly's work to try to find a way in which to alleviate the terrible burden of tuition fees on students in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that the Assembly is considering those issues in relation to the Cubie report. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take this in the best spirit, but the Liberal Democrats are always free to pick and choose whom they support in different Assemblies and Chambers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he last met the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the impact of fiscal measures on average weekly incomes in Wales. [152752]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer regularly to discuss a wide range of topics. In his Budget last Wednesday, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced measures to build investment for the long term, building opportunity and prosperity for all. Incomes in Wales will benefit from changes such as the widening of the 10p income tax band and the increase in the minimum wage to £4.10 an hour. Our constituents are benefiting from high and sustained economic growth, employment, wealth and income growth, together with low inflation and low mortgage rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend confirm that the overall impact of the Budget, especially the fiscal measures for individuals, will be that, proportionately, low-paid workers throughout the United Kingdom and especially in Wales gain far more than any other group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. As he knows, people in Wales have suffered for many years as a result of low incomes. I believe that the proposals in the Budget, together with the comprehensive spending review and previous Budgets, all suggest that those in Wales who are less well off and disadvantaged will benefit from the Government's actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>National Minimum Wage</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What impact the increase in the national minimum wage will have on employment in Wales. [152753]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is little or no evidence of higher costs feeding into higher prices, or of a negative employment effect as a result of the minimum wage. Indeed, jobs are being created, especially in the service sector where the national minimum wage has the most impact. The policy is successful and has the approval of not only trade unions and the low paid themselves, but the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Confederation of British Industry, small businesses and even the Institute of Directors, which has said that the national minimum wage has been a success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Does he agree that the minimum wage has been of particular benefit to the valleys of south Wales, where job prospects were decimated after the previous Government got rid of the coal industry? Many people were forced on to slave wages, and to areas such as the Cynon Valley, where wages were low. Obviously, we would like the minimum wage to be even higher and to approach £5 an hour; perhaps in future it will. Does he agree that more than 70 per cent. of those who have benefited most have been women and that the national minimum wage has done more for women's wages than anything else in the past 30 years since the Equal Pay Act 1970 was passed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that Labour Members can be proud of the minimum wage. Last week's rise to £4.10 an hour, which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, is welcome. It will, as my hon. Friend says said, most benefit women and people on the lowest incomes. I assure her that in a forthcoming general election, it will not be my policy to mention the fact that the Conservatives and nationalists did not vote for it and that the Liberal Democrats gave it lukewarm support. She can rest assured that that will not pass my lips during the election campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Employment (North Wales)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the First Secretary about employment levels in north Wales. [152754]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regularly meet the First Secretary to discuss a wide range of issues including employment in Wales. The Government's economic policies continue to encourage investment in Wales and create more jobs. Recent investment in north Wales includes £17 million by Port of Mostyn Ltd. in Mostyn docks, which created 85 jobs in my constituency. An investment of £100 million by Toyota, Deeside, created 310 skilled new jobs in your constituency, Mr. Jones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member --> (Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that heartening answer. I am sure that he agrees that it is important not to talk down the Welsh economy, as many other parties are currently doing. I know that he has had a long journey to the wonderful town of Cwmbran this morning and may be a little tired, so I hope that my question is not too difficult for him. Will he suggest what may be responsible for these wonderful figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two causes of the low unemployment in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and every constituency in Wales. First, the Government's strong economic policy has brought low interest rates and inflation and produced investment in the community. Secondly, our policies have had a major impact on long-term youth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
unemployment and long-term unemployment for older people. Those policies have happened not by accident, but through the stewardship of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I strongly believe that other parties with other policies may put that stability at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (Translation)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can anyone describe the situation as heartening, when so many industries and factories such as Dynamex in my constituency and the factory in Llanidloes are losing jobs, and the tourist industry is under threat? Will the Minister tell the Committee what the situation is regarding the employers' national insurance contributions that the Treasury refused to give in the Budget last week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that areas of difficulty will always exist. The problems in Shotton, in your constituency, Mr. Jones, affect my constituency. Problems exist in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and are compounded by things such as the foot and mouth outbreak. However, irrespective of anything that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said last week, there are more people at work in Wales and more opportunities for employment now than there were in May 1997. The new deal is working, the minimum wage has improved wages in many constituencies and new opportunities are being offered the area by Toyota, Mostyn docks and British Aerospace, for example, which are receiving Government support. I do not underestimate the difficulties that will always exist, but the right hon. Gentleman should give the Government credit for helping people through the difficulties and for ensuring that the areas of employment are a success. I put one question to him. How would an independent Wales help employment prospects in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Council Tax (Monmouthshire)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he had with the First Secretary about the level of council tax in Monmouthshire. [152755]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the relevant times throughout the year I discuss local authority finances including council tax with the Assembly First Minister. I have not, however, spoken specifically about council tax in Monmouthshire since last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend meets the First Minister, I hope that he will talk about the funding formula for local government in Wales and recognise the concerns of the people of Monmouthshire that the current funding formula does not give due weight to the rural nature of the county and to problems of sparsity. However, does he agree that the local authority sets its council tax and that if the people of Monmouthshire are worried about the current increase in council tax, they must take that up with the local authority? Every local authority provides vital services such as education, social services, housing and environmental services. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
should be the duty of local authorities to inform all people about the services that are provided and to assure them that they get the best value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: will meet the First Minister this afternoon, immediately after the debate. I assure my hon. Friend that I shall raise that general point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to point out that the manner of setting council tax is a matter for individual local authorities to decide. The Welsh Local Government Association welcomed the local government settlement for 2001–02 as one of the best for many years. That is a direct consequence of the excellent spending review that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor gave Wales last year. It will provide for the substantial growth of local services and should allow council tax increases to be significantly lower than in recent years. If Monmouthshire increased its budget in line with the Assembly's assumptions, its council tax would increase to £631 for a band D property compared with an assumed Wales average of £669. The settlement will allow Monmouthshire to set its budget at £85.8 million, which is an increase of nearly 6 per cent. from last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am compelled to speak because of the complacency of the question and the answer. What discussions has the Secretary of State had with the leader of Monmouthshire county council about last year's damping exercise, when money was taken away from an efficient local authority and given to inefficient local authorities? The new formula is rigged against rural counties such as Monmouthshire, which has been efficient, and money is given elsewhere. We should look for parity: not special treatment, but equal treatment for Monmouthshire. Why should it be caned for being efficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: have sat on every Local Government Finance Bill since 1987, when I entered the House. On such occasions, the only thing that the hon. Gentleman's party did was to introduce the worst possible form of local tax—the poll tax. The council tax is an improvement on that and I remember dealing with it. However, the hon. Gentleman must understand that, ultimately, the Assembly deals with such matters.

such consequences would be matters for my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the National Assembly for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->(Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State aware of increasing concern, especially in north Wales, about animals being moved unnecessarily? Bodies may travel from Anglesey to Widnes, which makes the situation worse. From his discussions with the First Minister, can he confirm that it is the responsibility of the Treasury in London to get additional resources to pay compensation? Will he fight not only for farmers, but for related industries such as hauliers and abattoirs, and for the tourist sector, which are also hit hard? Unless there is intervention, hotels, restaurants and the whole economic basis for tourism will be devastated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I sympathise with the points that the right hon. Gentleman makes, which apply not just to north Wales but to the rest of Wales. As he will know, all of us to some degree represent farming areas: for instance, if he looks out of the window, he will see that that there are many farms in an area that is regarded as an urban valley. We are all affected. I take the right hon. Gentleman's point about movement of animals, but he may have heard the First Minister say on "Good Morning Wales" this morning that because those animals are completely sealed, there should be no safety problem. I agree entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's second question was about compensation. Obviously, the best way to deal with the matter is to ensure a speedy end to the outbreak. All of the attention of the Government and the Assembly is drawn to that aim. He will be aware that compensation is paid directly to the farmer, but he refers to the impact on tourism and so on, of which we are all aware. It has not in the past been the practice of any Government to pay out consequential compensation. The Government and the Assembly are talking to the insurance industry and we must consider some points that have been made. Discussions are continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend consulted Agriculture Ministers in Westminster and in the National Assembly to find out whether the over-30-months scheme can be extended—for a short period only—in view of the crisis? If a farmer in Tremeirchion in my constituency does not get his animals to slaughter by Wednesday, he will lose out tremendously on his capital investment over the past two years. He needs answers, and he needs them today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State aware that about 30,000 lambs that were sold just prior to the outbreak in France and are now being slaughtered by the French authorities have not been paid for? They are worth about £65 a head. The French Government may compensate the recipients in France, but not the Welsh producers whose lambs they are. Will the Secretary of State take up that matter with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry? Will he also use his influence in connection with the size of the exclusion zone, which runs from the M4 up the A470 and now crosses a line beyond Welshpool? Producers there would like to get lambs direct to the slaughterhouse—in my constituency, some of them are 19 miles from an outbreak but cannot get their lambs to a slaughterhouse. Will he also take up that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the hon. Gentleman's considerable interest in such matters because of his constituency being, if not the most, then among the most rural in the whole of Wales—indeed, I shall refer to it later. He can rest assured that I will take up those matters. The points that he has made are on the record and will be taken up with the appropriate Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate Pembrokeshire county council on having been so successful in issuing licences as quickly as possible under the licensed movement scheme. However, given this morning's news of a suspected case in St. Clears, I know that many Pembrokeshire farmers will be especially concerned. Will the Secretary of State press the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to consider losses from cattle becoming more than 30 months old as direct, not consequential, losses? Those farmers who have kept their cattle as near to 30 months as possible have taken a responsible attitude by feeding them on grass, not on waste vegetable matter, which is another option. Those losses are as direct as if the animals had caught foot and mouth themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's interest in the matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the impact of the minimum wage will be much greater in less affluent regions of the United Kingdom, such as Wales and the north-east of England, than in other areas?

I am pleased that the Government have introduced the national minimum wage. My right hon. and hon. Friends should be proud of having voted for it.

[152758]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I established the Welsh sub-group of the coal health claims monitoring group to address coal health issues in Wales and to report back to the Great Britain-wide group. The Welsh group had its second meeting on 12 February. It was attended by the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), and it proved once again to be extremely constructive. I am convinced that the measures that it has discussed, and the actions that it has agreed to take, will further speed up the processing of coal health claims. The next meeting of the Welsh group is scheduled for a week today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great problems with the miners' compensation scheme is the availability of consultants. Healthcall expected them to be able to handle about eight claims a day, but they can only get through about four claims because of the incredible amount of paperwork and bureaucracy with which they have to deal. Justice Turner instructed that trials be held using nurses or health service officials to pre-read some of those documents. What has been the result of those pilots, and what in general is being done to improve the availability of consultants and to make better use of their time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the number of consultants is a hugely important factor in the success and the speed of the scheme. As he is aware, the court case indicated that consultants must be involved in the assessment, but that creates difficulties because there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
are not many consultants in Wales. I understand that Healthcall has attracted consultants to Wales from other parts of England and next week's meeting of the monitoring group will discuss a report from Healthcall on the pilot scheme to which my hon. Friend referred. He is aware that 27,000 compensation cases in Wales must be dealt with. So far, £1 million a day has been paid out in the UK, whereas £29 million has been paid out in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations has the Minister made concerning the injurious effect of the assessed clawback on compensation claims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important issue about which the hon. Gentleman has been concerned for some time. I have made representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and so far three proposals are being discussed with the Government and the claimants' solicitors. The first is that the Department of Social Security would issue nil certificates for interim payments if there were no clawback and the present assumptions tended to be overestimates. That will allow the Department for Trade and Industry to make larger and faster payments. Secondly, claimants will be asked to swear a statement of truth about when the disease started, which removes the need to search old medical records before payments can be made. Thirdly, certificates will be valid for 26 weeks instead of eight. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, negotiations can take longer than eight weeks; if they do take longer, there will be no need to obtain a new certificate. Those proposals are being considered by the solicitors and will be dealt with next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister does not express despair that, although the Government were elected on the promise to reduce waiting lists across the UK by 100,000, according to the latest figures from the National Assembly, they have increased by 11.5 per cent. in Wales alone. The number of those waiting more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment—zero in my constituency—has gone up from 1,400 to 4,800, which is an increase of 243 per cent. The figure for those waiting more than six months for an appointment has gone up by 714 per cent. Does the Minister not think that something should be done about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The something that is being done includes, for example, the extra £1.35 billion for health that the Chancellor of the Exchequer allocated in the comprehensive spending review last year. That will add extra investment to the national health service in Wales this year, next year and the year after, to ensure that waiting lists are tackled and that patients are dealt with. The Chancellor also provided an extra £100 million on Wednesday. Occasionally, there are difficulties with waiting list figures, but those figures are now on a downward trend. How would the Conservatives' proposed tax cuts ensure that public spending reached people through the health service in Wales? I doubt that they would, which is why there is a big difference between the Conservative and Labour parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.3pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Budget Statement and its implications for Wales.</p></q>
I do not know when the general election will be called, but this may be the last sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee before it happens. In the light of that possibility, I want to pay tribute to you, Mr. Jones, for your unique service to your constituency and Wales during the past 30 years. I also want to pay tribute to the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen who will be leaving representational politics—my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Sir J. Morris), the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey), my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) and, of course, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). In addition, there are other right hon. and hon. Members who are leaving the House but who will remain in representational politics—the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), my right hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), and for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) and the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones). Whatever our political differences, there has been considerable agreement—certainly since I became a Member in 1987—that together we have a special duty to represent Wales in the House of Commons. That duty is in no way diminished as a consequence of the establishment of the Assembly. I therefore pay tribute again to all those right hon. and hon. Members who will leave the House during the next few months. I shall look a right fool if there is not an election before the summer, because I will have to say all that again. We shall wait and see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee in Wales since the establishment of the National Assembly. That in itself is significant because it highlights the partnership that must exist between the Government in Westminster and the National Assembly in Cardiff. All those whom we represent in the House of Commons are represented jointly by us and by members of the National Assembly. I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) in whose constituency we now are. Although this great county hall was the county hall of Gwent, it lies in the county borough of Torfaen and in the constituency of Monmouth. If he manages to catch your eye, Mr. Jones, my hon. Friend will doubtless make some points about his representation of Monmouthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked hon. Members at some point during the day—not now, of course, as they are listening to me— to look out of the window at the great view up the eastern valley of Torfaen, or Gwent, as it used to be called. Since the middle of the 19th century, the economic development of our south Wales valleys, and this one in particular, has brought about a huge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
change in the way that people work. When my great-grandfather came from Ireland to this valley he worked in the iron industry, which became the steel industry. When my grandfather and father started working, they worked in the pits. Many thousands of people who had worked in the iron and steel industry went on to become coal miners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) referred quite rightly to the problems of compensation for miners. Only 20 years ago, tens of thousands of people still earned their livings underground. Not one person in this valley now works in a pit. In view of the dangers that miners have to endure, that is a good thing, but it means that well-paid jobs have been lost. The change came about during the past 30 or 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing companies came into our valleys, particularly those associated with the car industry, and they, too, have seen changes during the past few years. Those changes would have been noticeable to anyone who drove, as they might have done, from north and mid-Wales to south Wales, past what was British Nylon Spinners, which became ICI Fibres, and then past what was Parke-Davis and Warner-Lambert, glimpsing in the distance the Royal Ordnance factory in Glascoed, the British Steel works in Panteg and the two great Girling works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 15 to 20 years, about 10,000 jobs have gone in those industries, but that must be set aside what has taken their place. One can look across the valley at the new electronics, high-tech and service industries. Far from there being no jobs in this valley now, there are more. Some, admittedly, are not so well paid, but many are. That shows that economies can change dramatically. It is the job of government, by which I mean the Government of whom I am a member and the National Assembly, to manage that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase "set aside" gets my mind going. We talked about the changes in industry and the terrible events that are probably about to take place in the steel industry now. Oh that we had set aside the steel industry. The other word that my right hon. Friend used was "compensation". He said that it has been discussed, but it was unheard of before in certain industries where it is now being considered. If the Government are considering compensation for other industries that have never had it before, will they consider it for steelworkers? The deal that has been offered to Welsh steelworkers is abominable, compared with that offered to their fellow steelworkers in the Netherlands and other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would use the word "help" rather than "compensation". Individuals will receive help with reskilling and retraining if they have to change jobs, and new industries will have to be attracted so that people can move into other work. The Employment Service does an excellent job in trying to ensure that people can make such a transition. However, I do not wish to pre-empt any package that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
we might announce in the weeks ahead; negotiation is continuing between the trade unions and Corus on the future of the plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the changes in employment, there were 2,201 unemployment claimants in Torfaen in 1997. At present, there are 1,580. A thousand young people were given jobs under the new deal, and half of them found jobs afterwards. Of course, we must deal with the decisions announced by Corus. As many as 300 or more families might be affected when the decisions regarding Llanwern take effect, if they do. The impact upon the community of Ebbw Vale of the closure of the steelworks there, if it happens, would be enormous. I worked for 17 years in that steel area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leaders of all the main Churches in Wales sent a statement to the directors of Corus, in which they said:
	<br><q><p>"Leaders of the churches in Wales, in the light of the commitment and productivity of the workforce and the needs of their communities, as key stakeholders in the Welsh steel industry, call upon Corus to rethink the strategy which has demanded such a heavy price in terms of job losses."</p></q>
That is what the Church leaders say and, as representatives of the people of Wales, we are saying that, too. You have said it yourself, Mr. Jones, as the right hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside. Whether at Shotton, Gorseinon, Llanwern or Ebbw Vale, and in other places as a result of the knock-on effects, we are still urging Corus to rethink its decisions. We believe that they are short-term and that the plants in Wales are among the most productive and efficient in the whole of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We await the outcome of the negotiations and discussions towards the end of this month. In the meantime, the Government and the Assembly must work together to find ways to alleviate the situation. Ultimately, the best way to do that is to bring in jobs to replace those that have been lost. That is why there are 600 new jobs at Ford in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). That is why 260 new jobs are coming in wireless technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend said, Ford has announced that it is boosting production in Bridgend, principally but not entirely because of production of the new Jaguar engine, and has estimated that more than 600 jobs will result from that. However, the unions at that plant, which are not known for being overly optimistic on such matters, believe that, once production starts and the engine begins to sell, there could be even more jobs in Bridgend than the 600 already mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exceptionally good news, not just for the people of Bridgend but for people in other parts of Wales who work at that Ford plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I visited a company now called Technicolor—previously Nimbus—that makes compact discs. They employ 450 people and cut as many as 100,000 compact discs every day. That is an indicator of the sort of changes to which I referred earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that the tragedy of losing 200 jobs in a small town such as Llanidloes, through the loss of the former BSK plant, is every bit as serious to the local people and economy as the Corus closures in south Wales? Does he further agree that it is incumbent on Ministers to work with their opposite numbers in the Welsh Assembly to ensure that we do not forget smaller factories, such as the former BSK plant, and that we implement the same strategy of replacing jobs in those areas as we do in others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. It is right to work together because what matters is the impact on a community and its individuals. For geographically isolated communities, where much of the employment depends upon one small factory, the impact of its closure is as considerable as that of the closure of a steelworks. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the problems in his constituency but, as bad as the Corus announcements are, there is the other side of the coin: 17,000 more jobs came into Wales last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To illustrate as vividly as I can my right hon. Friend's point, I draw attention to my constituency. Who would have thought, even five years ago, that the two fastest-growing employers there would have been a call centre, One 2 One, and a meat company, St. Mervyn Meat Company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, who would have thought that that would happen in a great steel and coal town such as Merthyr? However, that is the nature of the change in Wales. That is the case in the aerospace industry in your own constituency, Mr. Jones, where BAE Systems is creating many jobs, and in fibre optics and Optronics in north Wales too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to intrude on all the back-slapping, but will the Secretary of State tell me his assessment of the impact of the climate change levy on manufacturing industry, especially in Wales? He will know that the CBI, the Institute of Directors and representatives of small to medium-sized enterprises are worried that that new tax will make Wales less competitive than other European countries, and that we could easily lose jobs to them. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had a great opportunity last week to alleviate the damage being done by the climate change levy, but he did nothing and jobs will be lost as a consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that jobs will be lost. The hon. Gentleman will have seen today's news of the huge importance of addressing climate change. Unless Governments throughout the world address the problem, we will store up enormous trouble for the future. Industry must play its part and ensure that it regulates itself, so that we look after our climate and environment. I have no doubt that discussions took place between my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the relevant associations of businesses and industries. Of course, some will complain and grumble, but we must address the issue of the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
This is not a question of back-slapping. My point is that, although we have problems and it is important to understand the implications of Corus closures and the points made by hon. Members, we must tell the world that Wales is a flourishing country in which it is good to invest. We must tell people that because it is not only important, but true. We should examine the figures: we have the lowest unemployment since 1972 and all members of the Committee can point to the fact that fewer people are out of work in their constituencies now than for more than a quarter of a century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are debating the Budget, so will he now answer the question that I put to the Under-Secretary earlier? What has happened to the bid that was to be made for operating aids in objective 1 areas? It was recommended unanimously by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs and pressed for by the First Secretary and Deputy First Secretary in Cardiff?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discussions are still under way about the issues raised by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. I completely reject the right hon. Gentleman's accusation of complacency; how can I be complacent when hundreds of my constituents will lose their jobs if the Corus announcement is fulfilled? Individual human beings and their families will face hard times. However, there are alternatives; something good is happening in Wales. There are many extra jobs in different industries and the trick is to ensure that the people who lose their jobs are reskilled, retrained and led into new, and good, jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of Wales being able to regenerate itself, I give the example of my constituency, where three years ago 800 jobs were lost at Kwik Save. However, in the past four years, unemployment in my constituency has been reduced by 25 per cent.—an extra 564 jobs. There are 150 manufacturing jobs at TRB and 170 at Hotpoint, and in the service sector there are extra jobs in WTS Holdings. What does my right hon. Friend have to say about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I welcome those jobs but, again, the trick in my hon. Friend's corner of Wales, where 350 people will be made redundant in Shotton, is that they will have the opportunity to move into new industries and businesses. That shows how important it is to ensure that Wales has a diverse economy, which is not dependent on single industries and which attracts more small and medium-sized firms, dependent, of course, upon the nature of those firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that Plaid Cymru's doom-mongering is an incurable addiction and its picture of the despair and dereliction of Wales greatly damages us in the eyes of the rest of the world? We will fight for those areas where the jobs are going, but will the Minister remind the Committee that, last week, the two high-tech companies chosen to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
receive the top prizes for innovation were Welsh, from Newport. Cannot Plaid Cymru look at the figures on unemployment and realise that in many parts of Wales, especially mid-Wales and south Wales, there is a phenomenon that we have never had before: unemployment lower than what used to be called full employment in the 1950s and 1960s? There is now something called nano-unemployment in some areas. We should celebrate that and boast about it and tell the rest of the world that Wales is a progressive country, which is a good place in which to live and set up new businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. It is all the more telling because my hon. Friend is the Member for Newport, West; although Llanwern is not in his constituency, he worked there, and he is one of the two hon. Members who represent the Newport county borough. No one is more qualified than he is to say, "Yes, we hugely regret what Corus has done, but we need also to tell the world that Newport and the rest of Wales is a good place in which to invest, to work and to grow up," all of which are helped by the Budget. Inflation is the lowest since records began and Plaid Cymru knows that, above all else, inflation kills economies. We have a stable economy and we are reducing the national debt in a way that was never done in the two decades when the Conservatives were in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State talks about low inflation; can he tell the people of Wales, who are now paying their council tax, why even this year, it is three times the official rate of inflation? People on limited and low incomes must find that money; is it not another example of a stealth tax that the Government passed on to local authorities to pass on to the people of Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that it was his Government who introduced the council tax in the first place. Due to the National Assembly and its excellent settlement, what the hon. Gentleman claims is not the same throughout Wales. In Pembrokeshire, for example, there is no increase in council tax. However, the council tax must be set against the standard of living and quality of life of the rest of the Welsh people. When the Conservative Government were in power, public debt rose at an unsustainable and threatening rate. In 1992, they were elected on the platform of unsustainable tax cuts, and chose to borrow and borrow, not for capital expenditure, which is why people usually borrow, but for revenue. In 1997, 44 per cent. of net public debt as a proportion of GDP was paid out in national debt interest; today, the figure is 31.8 per cent. Instead of going into the pockets of international bankers, all that money has gone into our schools, hospitals and public services. That is the difference between the Conservative and Labour Governments on national debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are helping business in other ways. The increase in the VAT registration threshold to £54,000, the highest in the European Union, will help 140,000 small and medium-sized Welsh businesses. We have cut corporation tax and capital gains tax and have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
introduced a package of measures to help Wales regenerate its deprived areas. In particular, we are considering proposals for community investment tax credits and we are consulting on tax breaks for urban regeneration companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During Question Time, several members of the Committee rightly referred to the rural economy. When talking about the impact of the measures that I have described, we cannot disentangle our urban from our rural economies. At the weekend, I was in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. As I walked through Llandrindod Wells and Builth Wells, many people came out into the streets and spoke to me about the problems that they faced, such as unemployment and the foot and mouth outbreak. It is important that all of us in Wales understand the problems in one another's constituencies. As well as managing the change in industrial areas that I have described, we must manage a change in rural areas. We in Wales will have tremendous opportunities when we have overcome the present crisis. I am thinking of the produce that we can export to the rest of the world, whether lambs, beef or other produce from the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has spoken eloquently about the great economic changes that have taken place in this and other valleys in south Wales, which have had a marked effect on the working lives of the many thousands of people who have moved from one industry to another. Does he accept that the Government have a role in managing change, not only in the urban industrial context, but in rural communities, which involves rural communities wholeheartedly embracing the fact that there is and must be change if we are to compete in an international market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do. Again, we are privileged to have a mix of communities in Wales. We can mix up rural and urban and ensure that we develop different ideas. Let us take the example of the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, where he lived and where his mother taught in Hay. That town was transformed from a sleepy little market town to a world centre for books. That may be a small concern in the total economy, but not for the economy of Hay or the surrounding areas. There are dozens of similar examples, which the Assembly, the Government and local authorities can foster to ensure that there is diversity in our rural communities as much as in urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also understand that the other measures in the Budget—whether on the minimum wage, the reductions in income tax, the working families tax credit, the new deal and the increase in public dealing—have an impact on rural as well as urban communities. People in rural areas are as concerned as those in cities and our valleys about hospitals, the minimum wage and so on. The impact of the changes on all parts of Wales must be considerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State rightly mentioned the importance of hospitals in rural and industrial areas. Is he aware that global warming, to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
which he has referred, poses a threat to development along our coastline, threatening Porthmadog hospital in my constituency and other developments because of the planning blight that it has caused? Can the Secretary of State confirm what additional resources will be allotted to Wales from the Budget to safeguard our coastline against the effects of global warming and allow reasonable development in our communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot provide precise figures, but I was interested to hear what the right hon. Gentleman said and I can assure him that I will discuss those problems when I next meet the First Minister. I shall return to public spending later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every single person in our constituencies will benefit from the new deal for the over-25s, and 50,000 people will be directly affected by it in Wales. As to the 10p income tax band increase, more than 1 million Welsh people will benefit. The increase in the working families tax credit will help 67,000 working families, and the increase in the minimum wage will improve the lives of 80,000. In this constituency, 2,611 Torfaen families benefit from the working families tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget also helps families, for example through measures on maternity pay and leave, and paternity leave is now available for the first time. A quarter of a million Welsh families will benefit from children's tax credit, on top of the increases in child benefit that have already helped 350,000 Welsh families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who say that the Government have done nothing for pensioners will have to think again. The Budget implemented measures relating to what we already knew about in the pre-Budget review, but the impact now will be that all Welsh pensioners will benefit from a direct increase in pensions. On top of that, and in contradistinction to what the Conservatives are likely to do, pensioners have £200 in winter fuel allowance; the over-75s have free television licences; and there is the minimum income guarantee. By 2003, pensioners who suffer from the poverty trap in the middle range will be helped through changes to pensioner credit and income tax. If that is not a good package for pensioners in Wales, I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite all the good news, the feelgood factor has not spread to people throughout Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those people whom it has not reached are unlikely to come out and vote for Labour. The right hon. Gentleman should know that indirect taxation at 27 per cent. is higher than direct taxation. That is why the poor in our communities are hammered: they have to pay the same amount in indirect taxation as they do on their wages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On average, households will be £590 a year better off as a consequence of the Budget. Families with children will, on average, be £1,000 a year better off. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
but indirect taxation has to be viewed in relation to other direct and indirect tax benefits. If we compare the average life of a Welsh person under the present Government with what it was under the previous Government—especially in the light of the number of people previously out of work who are now in employment—no meaningful comparison can be made in the quality of life. The Welsh people understand that. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that people will not appreciate that when the election is called. We shall have to wait and see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that Plaid Cymru is inconsistent on the rate of taxation? Plaid Cymru's policy is greatly to increase the taxes of Welsh people; incredibly, they also expect people in England to pay higher taxes to benefit Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have consistently remarked on that inconsistency. It is a feature of opposition politics; over 20 years, we might even have performed the same pranks ourselves. Ultimately, public services can be improved only if one is prepared to pay for that improvement. Remarkably, our public services have been better resourced since last year's comprehensive spending review, while direct taxation has been reduced. The reasons for that are obvious to everyone; we are paying less in national debt than ever before and more people are in work. If there are a million more people in work, there is more taxation. The increased burden of taxation—although it is nothing like what the Conservatives said it would be—has occurred because of our success; more people are working and getting more money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State confirm that if the Government are in power in 2003–04, they will—according even to the Chancellor's forward forecast figures—spend less on public expenditure as a proportion of our national wealth than the Conservatives did for 15 of their 18 years? Does that not underline the fact that those who voted new Labour in 1997 got Tory spending plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the hon. Gentleman's second point, about Tory spending plans, first. He knows full well that we would not be in the position that we are in unless we had ensured a strong and stable base. We did so in a way that has made ours one of the strongest economies in not just Europe, but the world. Spending has also been affected by the fact that there are fewer people on the dole. We do not have to pay out unemployment benefit, but we have taxation coming in. We are managing the economy and investing in our public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several Plaid Cymru Members raised the issue of taxation. Is my right hon. Friend aware that £10 billion is raised in taxes in Wales while £16 billion is spent there, leaving a £6 billion fiscal deficit? Has he any idea how that money would be raised in an independent Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None whatsoever; it could not be. The argument for an independent Wales is a perfectly legitimate one for which people should be able to vote, but they must do so with the understanding that all the attacks on so-called middle England, south-east England and so on come to naught because we need to be part of the United Kingdom to ensure proper resources for Wales. Do we think for one second that that would occur if there were an independent, separate Wales? Of course it would not. We would be reduced to penury. We simply could not afford an independent Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talk Wales up because it is important, as part of the United Kingdom. We cannot separate a Budget that essentially raises money from a spending review that sets spending plans. Last year, Wales had the biggest spending review ever; £2 billion more over three to four years. That is the biggest increase in resources. The Budget has also ensured that an extra £100 million goes directly into the coffers of the National Assembly to improve the quality of life of Welsh women and men. That is an enormous increase. We would receive nothing like that sum if we were separate from the rest of the United Kingdom. Of course it is important for Wales to have a devolved assembly and our status as a special country within the United Kingdom must be recognised, but it is only within the United Kingdom that we receive those benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had heard what the Secretary of State was about to say about us before I got to my feet.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the horror of its activists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On indirect taxation, does the Secretary of State agree that a principle is at stake? Indirect taxation can never be as fair because it is not proportionate to one's ability to pay. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy made a good point when he criticised the Government's shift in strategy, which occurred, perhaps, to hide the increase in taxation. Although an increase may have been necessary to meet spending commitments, the money was raised in a way that was less fair to those with less income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the tax cuts and increases of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to target poorer families. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State realise the hypocrisy of statements made by the Liberal Democrats? One of their policies is to increase direct taxation on cigarettes, which might be a good idea. However, they also want to introduce a carbon tax, even though they got a little worried during the petrol crisis. What is a carbon tax, if not indirect taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is an inconsistency. The Liberal Democrats know full well—as does Plaid Cymru, to a certain extent—that they will never form a Government of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real danger that besets the people of Wales is not whether there will be a Liberal Democrat Government or whether Plaid Cymru will increase its representation, but whether there will be a Conservative Government following the next election. The greatest danger to Wales is a return to those dreadful 20 years when the Conservatives ruled this country. In a convoluted way, the Conservative party is proposing cuts of £16 billion; perhaps Conservative Members will be able to explain those cuts in more detail. The Government have examined them and they are from the clouds. The Conservatives argue that they will save millions of pounds on regional assemblies. What regional assemblies? They do not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members raise points about fraud, but they can all be challenged, as they were by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. If the cuts that they promise came about, they would have an enormous and damaging effect on our public services in Wales; our hospitals and schools. They would damage the concept of devolution and undermine it by removing resources from the devolved assemblies. The fight of the next few months will be about whether people want a Conservative Government or a Labour Government in Westminster. The partnership that has been exercised between the Government and the Labour-led Administration in Cardiff has infinitely improved the quality of life for Welsh women, men and children. Wales is able to face the next century with greater confidence and enthusiasm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Parliament. I also wish well the other right hon. and hon. Members who are leaving. I would refer to many by name, but they are too numerous. However, I especially praise the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), who has been in the House a very long time and served his party with great distinction. The time that we have spent with all these contemporaries has been a happy one, and they have served their country well. Although we come from different directions, we share an unblemished commitment to Wales. It is important that we try to do our best for our country and its people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to job losses and to new industries, and I will return to those topics. Geography is a factor in such matters, and I have watched his home area go through the many vicissitudes of economic activity that he described. That area has benefited from its geographic position in relation to the south-east of England and other parts of the United Kingdom, and good luck to it. However, other areas, such as the western valleys, have been less fortunate because they are further away, or sparsely populated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has a poor infrastructure. It has improved slightly over the years, but much remains to be done, which is largely the job of the Assembly. The state of the railways—the legacy of the previous Conservative Government—is appalling. This morning, it is taking people an additional 20 minutes to get through the Severn tunnel, and it has been estimated that journeys in the opposite direction may take an additional 40 minutes. Such a situation is tragic, given that we are living in 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The infrastructure must be seized by the scruff of its neck. The Government have announced investment in the railways, but the structure, which the previous Government left in 100 different pieces, is totally inadequate. How well the railways run is sometimes said to be the test of a good Government. Most countries' railways run rather well, but our country has a very long way to go before its railways are run effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a nation we are clever, erudite and well behaved. Some of us sing well and others write poetry. We are ingenious, and capable of doing many things. We are far more self-confident now than Anne Robinson was at the time of her Liverpool memories, back in the 1950s. That is the only reference that I will make to her. As a result of devolution, we in Wales now have self-confidence and are making progress. Good things are happening in Wales, as the Secretary of State and other hon. Members have said. If we make the right strategic decisions, the future for Wales can be set fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has managed the macro-economy extremely well. However, other factors must be examined, and I will do so later. The social agenda in the Budget is, unquestionably, excellent. It harks back to old Labour, and there is nothing wrong with that. It is especially important that families and children be properly looked after, and I praise the Chancellor in that area. Mothers should get support to raise their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
families and be able to ensure that their children enjoy a good quality of life without having to scratch around for every penny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also good that the minimum wage has been increased and the 10p income tax band extended. The Chancellor should be congratulated on all that. In terms of business investment, the Budget is somewhat mixed, but corporation tax has been cut and the adjustments to VAT will be welcomed by smaller businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Liberal Democrat policy that the minimum wage in Wales should be lower than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that policy, and will he answer my question with his usual frankness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That certainly is not Liberal Democrat policy. As I recall, we debated the matter about 12 years ago and the policy of a variable minimum wage was thrown out. The hon. Gentleman should bring his knowledge up to date. It is extremely important that there should be a standard minimum wage throughout the United Kingdom. As we know, low pay exists in many parts of Wales and has been an endemic problem in terms of stimulating our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Chancellor left out some important matters, especially tuition fees. The Welsh Assembly has proposed banishing tuition fees, and the matter has been successfully dealt with in the Scottish Parliament. Getting rid of tuition fees throughout the UK would cost a further £0.7 million; a sum that is surely affordable at the moment. We also want free care for the elderly, which is very important and is being achieved in Scotland by the partnership Government. The rural community and farming, which I shall deal with later on, is another issue to which the Budget perhaps paid insufficient attention. I note that the temporary cut in fuel tax, which I welcome, ends on 16 June, which tells us something about the date of the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is balanced and follows fiscal rules, but it should be noted that the first two of the four Budgets since 1997 followed Tory Budget projections that have since been disowned by the previous Tory Chancellor. In reality, there have been only two years of Labour Budgets, which presents a problem in terms of the management of the economy. On being elected in 1997, the Government did not invest quickly enough in health and education in particular, and even the most recent Budget invested five times as much money in tax cuts as in health and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a huge majority and a record surplus; the latter in particular, which is the result of good economic management, is a fantastic achievement. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment are low. Everything is going in the Chancellor's favour, but where is the investment to regenerate manufacturing industry? I accept that aspects of the Budget address that issue, but they are not necessarily radical enough to save the day in Wales, where there are particular problems. We need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
to regenerate manufacturing in Wales in a big way, especially in areas that have not been particularly well favoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also invest in rundown steel areas and reverse rural decline. We should not seek to prise apart urban and rural areas. Many problems require an overall strategy to put matters right. The loss of 3,000 jobs at Corus, to which reference has been made, is tragic. We need to consider a comprehensive system to save the industry, and I hope that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs will shift Sir Brian Moffat's views on the prospect of diversifying and securing worker and management buyouts of some plants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comment on the importance of presenting a united front to both urban and rural areas is especially important in light of difficulties in steel and farming. The key economic question that unites the two areas is whether Britain enters the euro. The Budget did not signal the Government's policy on the euro and they seem unwilling to discuss such matters before a general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the Government have been extremely timid about the euro. We know that Wales depends upon manufacturing industry and agriculture more than other parts of the UK. Indeed, the failure to enter the euro on 1 January 1999 is the root of many Welsh problems. Commodity prices for both steel and farm products were hit for six by export difficulties and the many imports that resulted from the skewed exchange rate between the pound and the euro. We must pay more attention to both steel and agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third industry that is suffering is tourism, which has been severely damaged by the foot and mouth restrictions of the past 10 days. I hope that the Secretary of State will help the Wales tourist board to push the Government to implement a code of responsible tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the Secretary of State visited my constituency at the weekend. There is nothing wrong with visiting Welsh places such as Llandrindod Wells or Hay-on-Wye as long as one does not enter the countryside and contravene the security rules to prevent foot and mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hotels in my constituency are laying off workers. Many hon. Members will know Llangoed hall in the Wye valley. It laid off 18 people during the past week; I could name many similar examples. One would be able to visit towns, leisure centres, museums and other places in Welsh country towns if we had a code of responsible tourism. There is no doubt that responsible tourism is vital because anyone who has visited a Welsh market town in the past week will have noticed that it is deserted. I congratulate the urban public on respecting the foot and mouth rules, but if they are responsible they can visit the many towns that are suffering. Responsible tourism can proceed if ground rules are laid down.

Of course, foot and mouth affects not only big hotels, but bed and breakfasts. Farmers who cannot sell their stock and hoteliers who cannot let their beds are confronted by the same problem; cash is not coming in. There will be huge losses in those two interrelated sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government might want to find the money to enable local abattoirs to reopen? That would keep capital in the local area, which would be good in budgetary terms, and it would be easier to contain foot and mouth because the distance between the factory and the consumer would be reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. On most evenings I receive telephone calls from constituents about foot and mouth; other Members will be having the same experience. Last night, I spoke to a farmer who said that during the previous outbreak in 1967, he had to take his stock only three miles down the road to the local abattoir, but now he has to take them much further. He is in a zone where he cannot move his stock, although he is about 20 miles from the nearest outbreak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, I heard on the radio that the Government have decided to pay abattoir owners money to cover the additional costs of the scheme. Given that the Government have already applied for agri-money compensation to help farmers with their cash flow during this crisis, that shows that they are responding to the representations that have been made. They are a listening Government, and I am sure that they will respond to the cares of rural, as well as industrial, areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments, although I do not agree with everything that he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain why in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that the Government have managed the crisis well. As the hon. Member for Bridgend said, they have made arrangements for abattoirs to be given help with additional costs. However, he was wrong to mention agri-money compensation, which is money for livestock sold over the previous 12 months. One of the disappointments of the Budget was that no additional money was made available for the foot and mouth outbreak. However, I am confident that the Government will come up with special funding from the Treasury's contingency funds to address this huge problem. They should do so, because analysis of the announcements about compensation shows that it is intended to deal with previous shortfalls resulting from discrepancies in exchange rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would assist me tremendously in winding up the debate if he clarified his points relating to tuition fees, rural areas, compensation for foot and mouth, steel

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
and the need to invest more in education and health. If he were a Liberal Democrat Chancellor of the Exchequer, how much money would have gone to Wales to meet those costs and, on the other side of the balance, what taxes would he have changed to fund them? I have heard nothing about where the money is to come from and how resources are to be allocated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a classic pre-election question. As the Under-Secretary of State knows, we have costed our alternative Budget in great detail. For example, we are prepared to tax those who earn more than £100,000 at a 50 per cent. rate of income tax, we are sticking to our promise of an additional 1p on tax to fund education and we are prepared to put 6p on a pack of cigarettes to support our programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has a record, massive surplus and he ought to use more of it. He does not have to increase taxation, but he should be a less tight in his management and produce more money to solve some of the problems. For example, in relation to foot and mouth, the reopening of one or two abattoirs would not go amiss, which would not cost much. There is no doubt that the original outbreak of foot and mouth stemmed from pig swill, and its banning is long overdue. The importation of meat is not properly controlled. The previous Government reduced the number of inspectors at ports and that must be sorted out, because illegally imported meat was the origin of the present outbreak, as it was of the 1967 outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs. Thatcher's Government halved the number of vets at Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food centres and closed several veterinary investigation centres, and we are reaping the harvest. We are having to import vets from New Zealand, Australia and elsewhere to help out. They are doing a fantastic job, as are private vets, and they deserve our congratulations and thanks. This huge crisis will be overcome because safety measures have been put in place, but this is a virulent strain of foot and mouth disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The failure of the past four years to spend enough on health and education is the reason for the increase in waiting lists and class sizes in comprehensive schools. That must be addressed. There is an element of double-counting in some of the more optimistic statements that have been made here and in the Chancellor's speech. He said that he has provided £2 billion of extra spending, but the figure is only £1 billion, because half of the extra spending on public services that he announced is simply money that he failed to spend in the previous financial year. Given that and the size of the surplus, more could have been done to make an impact on the problems in the steel industry, tourism and agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their four years in Government, Labour's spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product is almost exactly the same as that of the previous Government, and education spending has fallen by 0.4 per cent. That is what we should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
examining. There has been too much caution. More doctors and nurses are needed in the national health service, as well as resources for free long-term care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want to mislead the Committee. He said that spending on education has fallen in comparison with spending by the previous Government. I am sure that he meant to say that spending on education as a proportion of GDP has fallen but that because GDP is far higher as a result of the Government's successful running of the economy, education spending, like other public spending, has risen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we know, GDP has gone backwards in Wales; only in the past 12 months has it increased by a minuscule amount. The hon. Gentleman's argument does not stand up and I should be grateful to be told the equation on which he based his calculation. Mickey Mouse economics should not feature in a Budget. GDP has fallen in Wales, although the hon. Gentleman does not acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument holds because GDP in Wales is in proportion to GDP throughout the United Kingdom. If UK GDP rises by 10 per cent., more money is available for public spending. The proportion may not be what the hon. Gentleman wants, but it does not mean that total spending has fallen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a stark contrast. If UK GDP has risen by 10 per cent. but GDP in Wales has fallen, something is seriously wrong somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the size of some classes in Wales has increased? Whatever the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) says about the figures, the reality is that teachers in Wales are still waiting for a substantial improvement in both morale and resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to annoy Labour Members too much, so let me say that there is no doubt that some of the special provisions in the Budget—especially those for tax credits—will benefit some of our more deprived areas. They include abolishing stamp duty in assisted areas, introducing community investment tax credits for those areas, tax credits for cleaning up contaminated industrial sites, corporation tax relief for urban and industrial regeneration companies, capital allowances on flats over shops and reduction of value added tax on residential property conversions in assisted areas from 17.5 per cent. to 5 per cent. All of those are extremely welcome, but we should have liked more action, especially in objective 1 areas, to reduce national insurance and to take other measures that are legal under European Union rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget shows a definite social conscience, which we support through and through, but more could have been done to re-establish economic support for those parts of the urban economy that have been

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Jones, and other members of the Committee to county hall, Cwmbran. It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. His sincerity and expertise in farming is acknowledged throughout Wales and he will be a loss to the Committee and the House of Commons should this be the last time that he speaks as a member of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pleasure to be here in county hall, Cwmbran. The Committee has visited different parts of Wales and it gives me great pleasure that it has come to my constituency at this time. County hall is also the administrative centre of Torfaen county borough council, and I regularly visit to meet council officers. Only two weeks ago, I came here with a representative of the United States embassy to discuss economic development in Monmouthshire, Torfaen and southeast Wales in the light of the Corus announcement and Torfaen's recent success in securing world heritage status for Blaenavon. Two years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Cwmbran new town, and a section of Cwmbran lies in my constituency—the area of Croesyceiliog, Llanyrafon and Llanfrechfa—which provides a good example of new town development and good social housing, much of it now in private ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the dominant issue in Monmouthshire for the past couple of weeks has been the foot and mouth crisis. When I last spoke to the National Farmers Union on Friday afternoon, I was assured that there had been no direct outbreaks in Monmouthshire, but the area has certainly been affected by outbreaks in Herefordshire and, I heard today, in Gloucestershire in the Forest of Dean. I pay tribute to all those who have taken such a responsible attitude here in Monmouthshire, despite the serious losses that many of them may experience as a result. Yesterday, I drove past a market garden centre that had closed because of the crisis, even though I understand that there is no requirement that such places should close. Caravan sites were much emptier than is normal for the time of year. Farmers and walkers have been responsible, and I would be appalled to hear that people were walking in this area, as they were through Snowdonia a couple of weeks ago, in defiance of requests by the local farming community to keep out to avoid the spread of foot and mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried to hear from local farmers over the weekend that when they telephoned the Cardiff MAFF office, they found that it was closed. They were being advised by the foot and mouth helpline, whose office—in the north of England, I believe—was open. I telephoned the Cardiff office myself at 1 o'clock on Saturday afternoon only to hear a recorded message saying that it was closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
I understand the anxiety of the farming community. At the beginning of the crisis, when there were about six or seven outbreaks of foot and mouth, horse racing was cancelled, whereas now that there have been 160 or 170 such cases, it has been resumed. I have sympathy with those members of the farming community who believe that double standards are at work in relation to what is and what is not being closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and express the pleasure of the people of Cwmbran that he now occupies that office, having formerly been the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office. The people of Croesyceiliog, Llanyrafon, Llanfrechfa and Ponthir in my constituency have benefited greatly from the economic stability seen under the Labour Government, who have given us stable interest rates that are 4 per cent. lower than the mortgage rates that we had under the Conservative Government. We have also had steady economic growth and falling unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not to say that there have not been difficulties, some of which members of the Committee have mentioned this morning. Several of my constituents work at Llanwern; many more of them used to work there, but they paid the price for increased productivity at that plant in early retirement and redundancy. The people who are now working there are being rewarded—if that is the right word— with the closure of the heavy end of its steel-making process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues on the Welsh Affairs Committee and I were appalled when we received evidence from the chief executive and chairman of Corus the other day. He came out with a startling statement. My hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) put to him that the Bryngwyn plant was making a profit, yet it was still being closed. We shall never forget his reply, which was, "I don't know whether it is making a profit or not." The company says that it is losing £1 million a day; it does not know which of its plants are profitable and which are not, but they are being closed anyway. That appalling management comes from someone applying a financial analysis with little understanding of the human impact of his business decisions. I hope that Corus will reconsider its actions and work with the Government. They have offered support, even though Sir Brian Moffat has denied that. The National Assembly is trying to resolve the crisis. I hope that people can work together as stakeholders in Corus and that as many jobs as possible are retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may remember that Sir Brian Moffat said that he been offered help, but that he did not think that it would fit the requirements of the law. He just ignored the offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, who is the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, makes a powerful point. We look forward to Sir Brian Moffat and his colleagues—who did not contribute much to those discussions—expanding on their analysis of which of their plants are profitable and what help they have or have not been offered by the Government.

No Government since 1945 have done as much to help families as the current Government. The 1945 Labour Government began the new peace and the reconstruction of Britain after the war. Having defeated Nazism, we had to defeat the social injustice that characterised so much of south Wales, especially in the valleys. That Labour Government introduced some good measures, such as family allowances, but for the second and subsequent children only. They continued the system of child tax allowances, which were eliminated when child benefit was introduced in 1976. There was no particular support for the working poor and there was no minimum wage at that time, but the current Government have continued with child benefit for all children and in April will reintroduce child tax allowances. That will be worth about £500 to families. The current Government have introduced the working families tax credit, which is a real benefit to low-income families. They are helping those in full-time and part-time work. They are providing a child care credit to encourage people to get off benefit and back into work by making work pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I talked to one of my constituents, Miss Ashleigh Clements, a single mother with two children who lives in Abergavenny. When I first met her, she was on benefit, but she now works in the local pub, she is training to work in the catering trade and she is benefiting from the sure start programme. She has admitted that that it has made a significant difference to her life, including giving her a better social life. I am sure that we shall hear more about Ashleigh Clements and other people who have benefited similarly from the working families tax credit. At my surgery on Saturday I met another single parent who needs to move into training. I was pleased to be at the launch of Monmouthshire community council for education and training, which is a major new initiative in Wales for education and training for the over-16s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is also benefiting from the national minimum wage, which rises to £4.10 an hour in October. It has been a great method of attacking poverty wages, reducing inequalities between women and men, reducing unemployment and boosting employment, especially for women, as was the Equal Pay Act 1970. A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Abergavenny job centre and was pleased to see the jobs advertised there. I remember when many advertisements in job centres contained the term "Neg", which was supposed to mean that the wage rate was negotiable, but effectively meant that it was negligible. I have done reports and research on the matter and I am pleased that, now, every job advertised in job centres must be minimum wage-compliant, although I think that advertisements should state, "at least £3.70 per hour".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley said that the minimum wage should be £5 an hour-plus. I agree with her in many respects, but I assure her that advertisements in job centres now state that if applicants have dependent children, the minimum wage will, in effect, be £5.60 an hour. It will be even more later this year. I suggest to the Government that there should be a minimum wage for working parents
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
of £5.60 an hour, which should be advertised as such. That is what the minimum wage is, because of the impact of the working families tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of weeks ago in Monmouth, I met a young man who is benefiting from the new deal. He had left the army and was on jobseeker's allowance. He wanted to do training at Simone's fitness centre in Monmouth, which took him on under the new deal. That is not a Mickey Mouse job like those provided under Government schemes in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result of the opportunities under the new deal, he will be able to qualify as a fitness instructor and might manage a fitness centre such as Simone's in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget gave a great boost to public services. Here in my constituency we have seen the benefits of the Government's investment in the national health service. A new day surgery unit has been opened at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, and a new community hospital has been opened in Chepstow, which I visited a couple of weeks ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the National Assembly for Wales will soon make a positive announcement about the new health and social care facility for the people of Monmouth, and that there will be a more rigorous examination of the development of mental health services for people in the area. I remember making a representation to Gwent health authority after the general election about the need for the Red Barn centre, which was going to be a new psychiatric centre. Unfortunately, it was never developed, although alternative facilities may have been built elsewhere. Recently, I met the parents of a young man who committed suicide as a result of his condition, and, perhaps, of the lack of adequate secure accommodation for such people. Mental health services have been neglected throughout the 20th century and require extra investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been extra investment in our comprehensive and primary schools. Across the way from here is the Croesyceiliog comprehensive school. I assure members of the Committee that there are no bog-standard comprehensives here and I resent that phrase being used about comprehensive schools. None of them can specialise in anything apart from providing comprehensive education, although many would be helped by improved facilities and refurbishment. I recently visited Caerleon comprehensive, which has a good academic record but could do with more investment in the form of a sixth-form centre, better facilities for the staff and better sports facilities. I hope that those schools will benefit from the Government's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been an honour and pleasure for me to speak in the debate in my constituency. The people of Monmouthshire and Torfaen recognise the ability of the Government to secure economic stability and social justice. It has been a pleasure for me to represent them in Parliament and will be my pleasure to do so for many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If ever there was an example of all spin and no delivery, it was this Budget, which contained a series of recycled announcements. We were given cuts in duty on petrol that no one can buy—clearly a great advantage to all of us—but there was no acknowledgement of the 45 stealth taxes, nor a new tax on spin, which was a great disappointment. The Secretary of State for Wales has done nothing to convince the Committee of the real benefits for the people of Wales; he has merely given us more spin.

Many Labour Members present will lose their seats at the forthcoming general election, some by choice, whereas others are on the list made by the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, the hon.

A degree of fantasy was evident in some of the speeches made by Labour Members and some of their Liberal Democrat friends.

I remind the right hon. Gentleman and other Labour Members that the reality is that the Labour Government have been responsible for the deterioration of the national health service in Wales. When the hon. Member for Monmouth spoke, I flicked through the figures for the health authority in the area that he represents. They show that the waiting lists in the Gwent health authority had increased dramatically not only the past four years, but in the past year.

that Labour is in power in the National Assembly, propped up by its Liberal Democrat toadies— Rhodri's little helpers—and that Labour is dominant in local government in Wales. At the general election, which the Secretary of State suggests will come soon, the Labour Government will be judged on their performance in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economic figures are important when assessing the Budget. The most recent available data show that in the three months to November 2000, the employment rate in Wales fell to 69.2 per cent. from 69.6 per cent. in the same period in 1999. Before any hon. Member jumps, I know that the unemployment rate also went down from 7.4 per cent. to 6.5 per cent. However, unemployment has been falling in Wales for almost a decade. The current concern is that the rate of job creation and the rate at which unemployment is falling have both slowed over the past four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment in Wales remains higher than the UK average. Recent job losses were announced by Corus at Llanwern, Ebbw Vale, Shotton and Bryngwyn, by Dairy Crest at Lampeter, Marshfield and Carmarthen; and by Valeo in Gorseinon. All such losses point to a structural problem that the Government have yet to face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Secretary of State referred, although not at great length, to European objective 1 funding. That funding has been secured, but the Treasury has not provided a single new penny with which to match it and the Budget contained nothing to address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will be judged on some of pledges they made at the last election, such as "education, education, education". The success of their education policy in Wales has been patchy at best. In 1997, the percentage of under-fives receiving full-time nursery education was 1.1 per cent. It remains 1.1 per cent. The percentage in part-time nursery classes has increased, but only from 25.8 per cent. to 27.7 per cent. That is hardly a realisation of the Government's vision of nursery education for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average class size in maintained primary schools has decreased from 26.4 pupils to 25.2 pupils. However, the effect of cutting primary school class sizes is seen in statistics for secondary schools, which show that, in Wales, secondary school class sizes have risen from 20.6 in 1997–98 to 21 in 1999–2000. At the previous election, class size was one of Labour's key pledges, and it has failed to deliver on it. The Budget has done nothing but create more spin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the Labour Government's greatest failure—no doubt, during the coming election we will return to it again and again—was their commitment to cut waiting lists by treating an extra 100,000 patients as a first step. The latest figures from the National Assembly about NHS waiting lists in Wales, dated 28 February, show that the number of Welsh residents waiting for in-patient or day-case treatment has risen from just over 67,000 in 1997 to 75,000 on 31 January
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
this year. That represents an increase of 11.5 per cent. The number of patients waiting more than 18 months for in-patient treatment has risen from 1,402 in 1997 to 4,818 in January this year—an increase of 243 per cent. However, the worst figure of all is the number of patients waiting more than six months for their first out-patient appointment, which has risen from 5,956 in 1997 to 48,506—an increase of more than 700 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Labour Government have not delivered and, as the health figures that I cited make clear, their friends in the Assembly have not delivered either.

I should like to return to the Budget and its effect on Wales. There are many measures that are warmly welcomed not just by Labour Members, but by all the people of Wales. The children's tax credit will give families up to £10 and the £5 rise in the working families tax credit will help to make work pay and to tackle the enormous problem of child poverty, which grew under the Tories. The minimum income guarantee will jump from £78 a week to £92 a week for a single pensioner, which is a wonderful increase for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
the poorest pensioners. There is an increase for all pensioners of £5 a week for single people and £8 a week for married couples. That is the biggest increase in the last 20 years, if not longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I greatly welcome the research and development tax incentives. One of the failings of British industry has been that we have not invested in research and development in the same way as Japan, Germany and the United States and other advanced economies. I am delighted that the tax incentives that we introduced earlier for small and medium enterprises are to be spread to the biggest companies. It will produce a huge long-term spin-off for the whole of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has a wonderful record on the macro-economic front. We have the lowest unemployment for 25 years, the lowest inflation since records began at 1.8 per cent. and the lowest interest rates. We have not mentioned interest rates this morning, but they are down to 5.75 per cent and are predicted to fall to 5.5 per cent. or 5.25 per cent before the end of the year. The cost of a mortgage is £1,200 less than it was under the Tories. There is steady sustainable economic growth of 2.5 per cent. a year. Debt is being repaid on a massive scale. As a proportion of GDP, debt repayment has dropped from 44 per cent. to 31 per cent. By transforming deficit into surplus, we now have the platform to expand investment in health and education substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next three years, we will see growth in real terms of 5 or 6 per cent. a year. That is a wonderful backdrop for a general election campaign. When we are returned—I am confident that we will be—the Labour Government will have a phenomenal record in health, education and the economy in the first half of our second term. We will deliver things that Labour Governments and Labour Oppositions over the years could only dream about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier exchanges, we heard about substantial job losses, which have had an impact in my constituency. We all go through bad periods. Dewhurst in Lampeter employs many people who live on my side of the constituency boundary; the same goes for Dairy Crest in Johnstown near Carmarthen. Valeo in Gorseinon has lost 270 jobs and some of my constituents in Ammanford have suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our dynamic economy, however, has breadth and depth and new jobs are continually being created. Mitzui Kinzoku is a new company in my constituency providing 100 new jobs this year. International Rectifiers in Penllergaer will also be a great help to those made redundant from Valeo; comparable technologies are used in the two companies. Ammanford has a call centre that is now ready for an occupant and we hope that another 300 jobs will be created there over the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out earlier, some job losses in the valley, which has gone through several generations of job changes, are to be expected. Job losses are part of life; the Government can only try to create an economic climate in which new jobs outnumber the losses. The Government have succeeded in doing so across Wales
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
and, more widely, across Britain. Unemployment has dropped substantially—by about a third last year—in every Welsh constituency. In my constituency, 1,536 people were unemployed in May 1997, compared with 1,037 according to the latest figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about job losses and gains, but fanning is vital to his constituency. While farming is now facing the worst crisis that anyone can remember, is it right for Parliament to spend time debating the banning of hunting with hounds, which will cost jobs in his own constituency? Even a Labour peer, Lord Donoughue, said that job losses might be twice as many as predicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to move on to rural affairs, so the hon. Gentleman has anticipated the next part of my speech. On foxhunting, he is out of line with public opinion, including opinion in rural areas. The number of jobs in foxhunting is trivial and the individuals affected can be much better employed elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving towards full employment in this country and, in recent years, the Chancellor has made it increasingly clear that that is the Labour Government's goal. The crocodile tears of— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I wish that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) had the courtesy to listen to my answer. It is amazing to see crocodile tears about job losses from a representative of a party that destroyed 30,000 coalmining jobs in south Wales. In that context, I am not too concerned about a handful of jobs in foxhunting. We can train those people to do much more useful activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers in rural areas have suffered from difficult times over the past three or four years; longer, in fact, as the trouble started with the BSE crisis. I recall Professor Peter Midmore of Aberystwyth anticipating 30,000 job losses in northern Wales. That was his prediction in 1997, but where are those job losses? At 2 per cent., Powys has the lowest unemployment in Wales. My own constituency has 3.5 per cent. unemployment and it is not so different across rural Wales. Fortunately, farmers are multi-skilled and able to turn their hands to other employment. The Government have created a suitable environment for massive job creation, which helps rapidly to mop up unemployment; I am delighted about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the foot and mouth epidemic, the Government are doing all they can to minimise animal traffic. I am delighted that the general public has been sensible in respecting the restrictions. Great difficulties have obviously been caused to the tourist industry in rural areas but all we can do is to try to minimise the duration of the problem to within four or six weeks; that is the purpose of the Government's policies. The Government will look sympathetically at consequential losses in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, in regard to the general election, the opposition in my constituency comes from Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party. We regularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
hear, as we heard this morning, pleas for more money for this and for that; for farmers, miners, students, the health service or pensioners. Plaid Cymru gives the impression that that will all be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that Plaid Cymru stands for an independent Wales. If we had the status of Ireland or Denmark, we would lose the Barnett formula; a loss of £2 billion a year. Should we ever have a Plaid Cymru Government, we would have cuts of 20 per cent. in the health service, education, social services and across the board. The so-called party of Wales does not represent the interests of the people of Wales. For the past 100 years, the people of Wales have voted for a Labour Government. They got a landslide Labour Government in 1997 and we hope that in a few weeks there will be another landslide Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>[Continued in Welsh]</i> I shall begin by quoting the Chancellor's remarks as reported in last Thursday's 	<i>Western Mail:</i>
	<br><q><p>"Because employment and the economy is growing and we are saving billions of pounds in debt repayments, we can target more help on Wales' priorities."</p></q>
That is exactly what Plaid Cymru has been saying for the past few years. The British economy is in fair shape but the chance to target economic policies to less well-off regions has been missed. Common sense tells us that some of that £16 billion surplus should be used to regenerate less advantaged areas in the UK, but what the Chancellor is saying and doing are two different things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, it again represents a lost opportunity for Wales. It does not enable us to create jobs in objective 1 areas. Wales is losing much and its problems are not being addressed. Some small businesses will welcome the VAT relief that will lessen bureaucratic burdens but generally the Budget has done nothing to help our industry. Manufacturing industry in Wales has suffered much over the past few months but Plaid Cymru believes that the country is strong and vibrant with a strong work force. That great potential should be used so that we can enjoy a success similar to that of south-east England. Unfortunately, the taxation incentives will have no effect on coal and steel industry areas such as Ebbw Vale. The Chancellor wants to do away with stamp duty, but will Ebbw Vale—an area that does not have money in the first place—benefit from that? Will it benefit from the reduction in the derelict land tax? Why is the Chancellor giving help to Corus rather than helping people on the dole? A policy for the future should already be in place if the plans for Corus are to go ahead. I support the members of the Committee who asked the Government to reconsider the matter, even at the 11th hour.

Some members of the Labour party accuse us of asking for an unreasonable amount of money to regenerate the Welsh steel areas. I assure them that we have considered the costs in detail, and about £200 million is needed. That is not unreasonable, bearing in mind the job losses. The objective 1 guidelines suggest about £55,000 for every new job in deprived areas. The task of the new Labour party is to list figures for the new jobs that it has created. Of course, creating new jobs is important; new jobs have been created and we are glad of that. However, it is as important to retain jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member --> (Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, 20,000 manufacturing jobs in Wales have disappeared since new Labour came to power. Reducing national insurance payments by employers, for example, would boost employers' ability to retain capital and jobs, which in turn would encourage the recruitment of staff. A reduction in corporation tax would also be an incentive to invest further. Plaid Cymru has for some time been asking for that policy to be implemented in objective 1 areas, but time after time the Chancellor has refused to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since Labour came to power, the rural economy has also suffered. The agriculture sector is crucial to the development of Wales and the continuance of rural areas and the economy. The current situation is the worst that we can remember. A succession of crises, including BSE and then foot and mouth disease, has been enough to kill the industry completely. It has also had to cope with a disadvantageous exchange rate. Even before the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, jobs in agriculture were being lost at a rate at 73 a week, which is on a par with the closure of a large factory every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average income for a United Kingdom farmer is £4,500 a year, but for those farming on high ground, which covers about 80 per cent. of the Welsh landscape, it is £3,800.1 am very concerned about the decline of that figure following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Unfortunately, the Government have dragged their feet on the claim for compensation for agriculture to overcome the problems caused by the strength of the pound. It took a crisis such as foot and mouth disease to get money from the Government, but that is not for compensation. Farmers were suffering hardship well in advance of the first outbreak, and the agriculture industry is crying out for compensation, without which the rural economy in general and jobs will be in real danger. That compensation needs to be extended, and other parties have supported that. The loss of certain breeds, for example, has resulted in a loss of profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the fate of other industries such as haulage, abattoirs and tourism in rural Wales? So far, the Chancellor has turned his back on them, but according to today's edition of 	<i>The Times</i> some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
discussion is taking place and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will in turn discuss extending the compensation to those who rely on the industry. That is vital for a complete, rather than a one-sector, economy. For example, in Plas y Brenin in Capel Curig, there is a centre for walkers where 25 jobs have disappeared, at least temporarily. We have heard that 18 jobs have disappeared at Llangoed hall. I understand that the Minister is considering that, and I sincerely hope that he will extend the basis for compensation, because in many constituencies in Wales, perhaps in all of them, tourism is the biggest industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member --> (Translation) 	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member --> (Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman think that the comments of one person will undermine the whole tourism industry? If so, he is more silly than I thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Continued in English]</i> Will there be full match funding for the objective 1 money to which Wales is entitled? New Labour seems to be happy for the deficit to be made up from block grant, even though it will take much-needed resources away from other sectors. The Chancellor proudly announces surpluses year after year—there is obviously room for pride— but why cannot some of the money be used to provide full match funding? The shortfall over the next four years will be in the region of £600 million. Labour likes to divert attention from that fact by concentrating on how much Wales would have to pay in match funding if it were independent. If it were independent, it would receive twice as much in grants from Europe and, unlike at present, it would be sure to receive 100 per cent. of those grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should concentrate on what happens now. Although £600 million match funding is being taken out of the block grant, spending in other vital sectors is falling behind that of England. There was an 8.6 per cent. increase in health spending in Wales, but a 9.3 per cent. increase in England. If Wales received the same percentage increase as England, the health service would have an additional £22.2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the mantra "Education, education, education", but the shortfall in that sector is even starker. Spending per head in England in 2000–01 is 2.3 per cent. higher than in Wales, and the gap will widen rapidly to become 9.7 per cent. by 2003–04. During those four years, the total spending on education in Wales will be £600 million less than it would be if the same were spent per head as in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quoting percentage increases in expenditure in the public sector.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor announced extra investment in education and health, which will result in an extra £100 million for Wales and that is welcome. However, services in Wales are desperate for even more money. The Chancellor makes less prominent the fact that the money must last us three years, making the amount £33 million a year—about £10 per head per person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Labour came to power in 1997, it promised a reduction in hospital waiting lists. In 1997, 6 per cent. of patients in Wales had to wait longer than six months for their first out-patient appointment. By the year 2000, that figure had increased by 458 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor announced £200 million to aid teacher recruitment. Again, that is welcome, although the timing—just before an election—is interesting. The average age of teachers in Wales is about 40. We need to recruit more young people to the profession, and longer-term solutions are needed to tackle recruitment problems. Of course, better pay is welcome, but there is more to recruitment than that. For example, new teachers in Scotland are guaranteed a 35-hour working week, non-contract hours and a support system. In Wales in 1998, 900 teachers left the profession before retirement age. In 1997, new Labour introduced an early retirement package; it spent a fortune getting people to leave the profession and it is now spending a fortune to get them back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that there was nothing in the Budget to help students. As I mentioned this morning, we know about the reduced numbers applying for further and higher education in Wales, while in Scotland, for example, applications have increased by 15 per cent. Help for students is another glaring omission from the Chancellor's statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good things in the Budget. I am the first to say that working families tax credit, assistance for younger families on low incomes, child care credit, and other measures are most welcome. However, some of the one-off pre-election investments are not good enough. We need to examine the way in which public services are funded. The Government have followed Tory spending plans and cut public expenditure to 38 per cent. of the GDP, which has led to reduced health and education budgets. Only now, with an election in view, is there an announcement of an increase in public spending. We need consistent investment, not stop-go short-term measures that might be designed to win votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Labour always says that a vote for Plaid Cymru is a vote for the Tories. However, people who vote for new Labour appear to get Tory policies. Plaid is the only party that offers a real alternative in Wales.

For some time now, I have been pushing the Government on miners' compensation and I am pleased to say that there is light at the end of the tunnel. For example, I had a debate on 6 February with the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe. He told me that the problem of widows having their pensions stopped when compensation was paid to them after their husbands had died did not exist. I advised him that there was a problem and that the Department of Trade and Industry was undertaking High Court action to ensure that the policy continued. The Minister was obviously shocked and was rude to me all day. Subsequently, we found that the policy has been reversed. I am pleased about that, but if hon. Members from other political parties had also done something, perhaps the Minister would have acted sooner. I am pleased that extra resources are going into public services. I appreciate that the Budget is finite, but the policy of continuing to claw back miners' compensation is ludicrous, immoral and wasteful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State might say that he does not need a lecture on miners' compensation from anyone from Meirionnydd. However, if the Government took a fair approach in the first place, I would not have to argue the points and the Government would not have to concede them bit by bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru believes that the Budget is not a good one for Wales; it is no Budget for Wales at all. Wales has been let down and I am sure that, come the election, the people will show their disappointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to speak about the Budget and what it has done for the future of Wales. I was brought up in Maerdy, and I remember the devastation that the Tories visited on that mining village and the lack of hope for the young people who grew up there. In my previous job—my last real job, some would say—I taught in social priority schools for 15 years, and I discovered that it is extremely difficult to motivate children from poor backgrounds with poverty of ambition and little hope and aspiration for bettering their lives.

Given what has been achieved in the past four years, and particularly in the most recent Budget, I am proud to be a member of this Labour Government. Wales has low inflation, low interest rates, low mortgages and high employment. Today's generation of young people are much better off than those whom I used to teach. Aspirations are much higher because there is the real option of a variety of work that has not existed in 25 years. The development and success of the new deal has created 814 opportunities in my constituency alone, where 406 young people have secured work as a result. Youth unemployment is greatly reduced— indeed, the new deal has virtually eliminated it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take great pride in our Government's efforts to help working families to bring up their children. Maternity pay has been increased and extended, and paternity leave is now given. Past Governments have ignored the needs and duties of women parents in particular, but they have also ignored those of men. When my first child was born, I was not entitled to paternity leave. To get the day off, I had to fiddle the system with the help of my head teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The failure to give such support to foster parents and adoptive parents was an indefensible anomaly. We have increased child benefit by unheard-of levels, and although there is more that we could do we have made great headway in helping people to bring up their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members have mentioned some of those points, but little mention was made—even in the Budget coverage—of the Chancellor's announcement that this year he will pay off £34 billion of national debt. Perhaps that is not regarded as a sexy issue, but £34 billion is more than was paid off in the preceding 40 years, and will result in a huge investment in young people. Had that money not been paid off, it would have been the young people of today who would have paid during the next 20 to 25 years in terms of increased taxes and reduced services. Some on the left used to argue—perhaps they still do—that we should borrow more to invest in services, but I have never regarded that view as moral. The argument that the following generation should be obliged to pay for services enjoyed by the current generation is not a socialist one, and I do not understand why it was advanced. I am very pleased that the Chancellor has shown his confidence in, and invested in, this country's youth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the extra money that has been put into education. We have not yet heard the Welsh Assembly's decision about what it will do with the money that it has been given for education and health. It is entitled to make its own decisions, and spend the money in any way it sees fit, but I sincerely hope that it is spent on Welsh schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
The Welsh Assembly has said that Wales has a skills shortage. There are problems in developing the Welsh economy, and with GDP. It has looked at Ireland as an exemplar, and at the ways in which Ireland has devoted money to education and upskilling to fuel its burgeoning economy. There is surely, therefore, an argument for the Assembly to spend at least as much money on education as the Westminster Government are spending, if not much more. I look forward to the Assembly's decision in the very near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must voice my disquiet about the Assembly's decisions on direct payments to schools. Both the English and Scottish Governments have decided that some money should be directed straight at schools. My experience—not only as a politician, but as a teacher in Mid-Glamorgan for 15 years—has led me to believe that, at a local level, schools themselves are often in the best position to make immediate decisions about what is in their best interests. That is empowerment for schools, and as a result they are often far better at screwing out the last piece of value from the money allocated to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear a lot about partnership, and I agree that there must be partnership between the different stakeholders and providers, and with local government. However, there must also be partnership with schools, head teachers, teachers and parents. In the provision of education, those people are as important as, if not more important than, local education authorities, important though their role is. I would like to see the idea of partnership extended to cover all who contribute to education, not just local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is an expert in the subject that he is discussing, and takes much interest in it. However, some schools are more wealthy than others, and have more reserves. If payments are made directly to head teachers and schools, rather than going through the local authorities, which can differentiate between schools and target money where it is most needed, how can relative wealth be taken into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority of money goes to LEAs and I am not arguing that it should all go to schools. Head teachers would, however, welcome some money, and in England the sums concerned are considerable: £40-odd thousand for each average primary school a year, for the next three years, and nearly £100,000 for each average secondary school a year, for the next three years. I trust head teachers to spend such money wisely—in my experience, they tend to spend it more wisely than anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prompted to make such comments because, during the past few weeks, an Opposition party has distributed a number of leaflets in my constituency. They draw critical attention to the Government's spending promises on education and health, and, in particular, allege that schools in Cardiff are underfunded in comparison with other areas. There may be nothing unusual in Opposition parties drawing attention to the Government's promises because it is their role to do so. However, the Opposition party to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
which I am referring is the Liberal Democrat party, which is not just an Opposition party in Wales, but a party of Government in Wales. It is even stranger that the leaflets were published at 133 City road, which is the constituency office of the Assembly Member, Jenny Randerson, who is also a Cabinet Minister with collective responsibility for making those decisions. I know that the concept of collective responsibility for decisions is alien to the Liberal Democrats and after 100 years it may be difficult for them to recall what it means, but I do not expect a Cabinet Minister, who receives a handsome salary for making collective decisions on education and health, to send out literature condemning those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education spend in Cardiff is low compared with most parts of Wales. Last weekend, I saw Chris Bettinson, deputy mayor with responsibility for resources in Cardiff, and asked him why Cardiff's spend is less than that for other parts of Wales. He replied that the standard spending assessment for Cardiff is almost the lowest in Wales, but not as low as in Monmouth, and that it is impossible to match the spend levels of other places without taking resources from other areas of local government responsibility. It is for members of the Committee to decide whether they believe that, but there are only two possible reasons for spending on education in Cardiff being lower than elsewhere. It is due either to the standard spending assessment being lower than elsewhere, as the local authority claims, so that it cannot match what other areas spend, or the authority is underspending on education in comparison with other services. If either of those reasons is correct, the responsibility to do something about it lies with the Welsh Assembly, which has the power to distribute money differently or to force local authorities to spend more on education if it believes that they are underspending. Yet, the leaflets were produced in the constituency office of a Cabinet Minister for Wales. What better example can there be of complete irresponsibility? I am astonished that neither of the Liberal Democrats present has attempted to defend that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that there was no intervention, because I was looking for an excuse. During our debate this morning, I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, who is the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Wales. I said that the Liberal Democrat policy on the minimum wage was to pay less in Wales and he told me that that had not been their policy for a decade or more. However, I have in front of me a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
document entitled "Investing in People and Assisting Enterprise" dated September 1998, which is not 10 years ago. It states:
	<br><q><p>"We believe in regional flexibility in the minimum wage and that the Commission"—</p></q>
which the Liberal Democrats intend to set up—
	<br><q><p>"should be specifically required to report and recommend on this."</p></q>
While I am at it, during the last but one Welsh Grand Committee, I intervened in the speech of the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Wales to point out that they do not support the new deal. He told me that they did, but they do not. That is a fascinating example of the confusion and hypocrisy that lies at the heart of Liberal Democrat policies. I know that the media are not usually interested in those policies—that is understandable, because they believe the Liberal Democrats to be an irrelevance—nevertheless, why do I, the Labour Member for Cardiff, Central, know more about Liberal Democrat policies than the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was no minimum wage at the time to which the hon. Gentleman refers.

I thank you for the discipline that I have learned over the past few years under your chairmanship. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, without whom I would not know half of what I know about Liberal Democrat policy, which is sometimes an education to me as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is timely that I should follow the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), who illustrates the importance of a dialogue and shows that it is possible for parties—in this case, the Liberal Democrats and Labour—to be in partnership in the Assembly, while maintaining healthy competition and different views on some aspects of policy. I shall return to the hon. Gentleman's questions, because he clearly thinks that there is a far greater likelihood than does the Secretary of State that we will form a Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by taking an unusual line. Despite the strong and aggressive attack by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central, I shall praise the Government, subjugating my feelings of anger to my values of honesty. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, there are many good things in the Budget. It would be disingenuous to pretend otherwise. The Government have raised the tax take, albeit through indirect taxation, while improving economic performance. That is a credit to the Chancellor, who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
has shown himself to be in touch with his brief; although I disagree with certain aspects of the policies that he has chosen to pursue. The fact that the Government have used the surplus to pay back the national debt is a great advantage, especially given the enormous and out-of-control debt that they inherited in 1997 from the Conservatives. They have invested some money in transport, health and education, and they have shown that they have a long-term strategy based on their assumption that they will win the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are all macro-points at a UK-wide level, from which some specific points of interest spin off. I hope that the Budget will be translated into clearer support for farmers at this time of crisis. As other Opposition Members have said, we must recognise that farming is on the verge of collapse and that foot and mouth could ultimately destroy the fabric of the rural economy, with effects that go far beyond agriculture. Given the surpluses that the Government have amassed, it would be timely for them to make a strategic statement of their long-term commitment to ensuring that we continue to have a working countryside. So far, there have been many tactical promises of individual payoffs, but I should like the Secretary of State, the Minister and, indeed, the Chancellor to make a strategic commitment to doing whatever it takes to prevent the collapse of the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister support other industries that are on the verge of collapse but are not directly related to farming? For example, the Redridge centre, which is run by Pete Jones, is a training centre; he has had to close all operations because it is in the heart of a rural area. He is losing thousands of pounds a day and he will go bankrupt if the crisis continues much longer. Can the Minister give a strategic commitment to support such industries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Does he agree that the relationship between agriculture, tourism and other economic activities in the countryside, which has been demonstrated in the current crisis, gives the lie to those who have argued that agriculture does not contribute to the Welsh gross domestic product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I am sure that he will pursue that point in his speech. I anticipate that our views would not differ on that area of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall criticise the Budget in case Conservative Members worry that we are blindly following the Government. First, the Budget is designed to win the 2006 general election. It is not especially generous because strategists in the Labour party assume that they do not have to hand out a huge amount of money, but want to prepare for 2006. The Secretary of State and his colleagues obviously judge that that will be the year when the Liberal Democrat party will challenge for the Government of the UK, which is something that they will want to be ready for. I am disappointed by the Budget because by playing long-term party politics, the Government have missed a chance to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
invest in health, education and pensions, which could have been done with the enormous surpluses that the Chancellor has achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the importance of repaying the national debt when there are pressing problems in Welsh education and health? The perception is that inroads have not been made into waiting lists, which is a missed opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central criticised the Liberal Democrats for holding what he regards as a hypocritical position on indirect taxation. I understand why he said that but I must clarify our policy commitments, which include a shift towards direct taxation. We would introduce a 50 per cent. tax rate for those who earned more than £100,000. Furthermore, if we could not find sufficient money to invest in education, we would increase income tax by 1p in the pound. Our strategy is to shift back towards direct taxation, although every Government must use a combination of direct and indirect taxation. That is a philosophically important debate that all parties should engage with. I am concerned that we do not have that philosophical debate often enough because we indulge in what might be regarded as point scoring. I hope that my party and others will return to that debate, but I suspect that that will occur only after the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another criticism of the Government, which has been mentioned previously, is their silence on the euro. In simple terms, if the economy continues to grow in strength it will ultimately be brought down by the strength of the pound, which is a self-regulating factor in Europe that will price us out of the export market. Can the Minister give us a commitment that the Government are seriously committed to fast entry to the euro? I fear that we shall lose the benefits that have been created in terms of a strong economy for simple fear of what the public might say about the euro.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was recently involved in an experiment with the BBC. After a weekend of campaigning, we convinced 58 per cent. of a group of people, 65 per cent. of whom were initially opposed to the euro, to vote for it. The Government should not be scared about the euro.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is dangerous for Conservative Members to remind us of their poor performance by criticising the Government's economic policy. Let us remember that the last Government were willing to borrow billions upon billions of pounds that they had no prospect of paying back only to save their skins. They did not even achieve that. It was a pity that the Tories were willing to mortgage the future to protect their party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He has completely forgotten that the Liberal Democrat party—and its predecessor, the Liberal party—had a great tradition of opposition. His party is now just part of the coalition. As the hon.

The Conservatives simply do not understand the difference between pursuing one's politics competitively and treating it as war. If people want negative, hectoring, accusatory and confrontational politics, they can choose the Conservative party in Wales. However, if they want a proactive approach with members who are willing to give credit where it is due and put forward a constructive, alternative case where it is needed, they should consider other parties, especially the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will remind the Committee of what the Liberal Democrats would do differently. We would cut waiting times and find the money for an extra 3,300 doctors and 11,400 nurses across the United Kingdom. We would ensure that average class sizes really went down to 25 for all five to 11-year-olds, and give every pensioner an extra £5 a week, £8 for every pensioner couple. We would pay for that in clear and transparent ways. We will increase tax for those earning more than £100,000 and we will be quite clear about our intentions for the lp on income tax. We will also make some capital gains tax changes. Those policies would add a considerable amount to that spent on the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will make a point that underlines the difference between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central was critical and cynical about the changes that we made in Scotland in respect of the abolition of tuition fees. It was a Liberal Democrat policy and our Labour partners in Scotland bought into it. The people of Wales can decide that either they do not want that policy or accept our commitment to abolish tuition fees for students. Voters will have to make that decision at the next poll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat party is trying to make politics more transparent. We want to be honest to the public about where we stand, where we agree with other parties and where there are alternative policies. Instead of investing in the 2006 general election, the Government should have invested in the people of Wales today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party is known for its co-operative and positive spirit, but voters must decide whether they want that kind of partnership. I will not tolerate hypocrisy in my party. If hypocrisy exists, I will take it up internally and externally. I want our party to be honest, and to be seen to be honest. I give that commitment to all hon. Members and to the public. If the people of Wales want a party that has proved that it makes a difference

when in government and that its actions are transparent, they should consider giving their vote to the Liberal Democrat party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main points of the Budget speech gave positive indications for Wales and the Welsh economy. However, it is worthwhile first to describe the economic backdrop of recent years to help us to measure the progress made by Labour since 1997. In particular, it is worth reflecting on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher in Wales. During her period in office, 23,000 miners lost their livelihoods; 65,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing industry; council house construction was slashed by 90 per cent.; the poll tax was forced on us; we limped through Black Wednesday and its consequences, and endured boom and bust; we experienced record home repossessions and negative equity on homes for the first time; we witnessed the tragic economic and social breakdown of some of our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That land is now foreign to us. I suspect that it is the land to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred. He claims that we would return to that land after the next general election, if the Labour Government won another term. The opposite would be the case. When Conservative Members reflect on the failures of Baroness Thatcher's dismal 11-year reign, they will fully understand why none of them represents a Welsh constituency. In 1997, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) lost the battle, but the war was lost during Baroness Thatcher's dismal reign of economic failure and decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I was heartened to read that some Tory parliamentary candidates are contemplating using photographs of Baroness Thatcher in their election material at the next general election, instead of the customary mugshot of the Leader of the Opposition. I commend them for contemplating that; if a leaflet bearing the image of Baroness Thatcher fell through the letterbox of any Welsh voter, that would guarantee that the Tory party remained as numerically challenged in terms of parliamentary seats as it is today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After only four years of Labour Government, the recovery of Wales presents a sharp contrast. Wales has undergone an economic revival over the past 47 months. If my party's pledge card had included a commitment to achieve the lowest inflation ever and the lowest unemployment and interest rates for some time, nobody would have believed it. We have fulfilled those pledges, and achieved much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, one of the biggest success stories has been the introduction of the new deal. That is the same new deal to which the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) referred, in his usual mild-mannered tones, as
	<br><q><p>"a colossal and expensive failure" </p></q>
and a
	<br><q><p>"rotten service at a rip-off price".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
I recommend that he and his Conservative colleagues visit their local Employment Service offices. I did that recently. The people whom I met there deal daily with employment issues and they are delighted with the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction of youth unemployment was a key Labour general election pledge, and I am proud that it has been achieved in Wales. Today, as a result of the new deal, 17,000 young people in Wales have secured a job; Labour's target in the 1997 general election was to secure 13,000 jobs for under-25s. By the end of November last year, 6,300 employers in Wales had signed up to support the new deal. That is an amazing statistic, although the economic measures used by Opposition Members are, perhaps, more amazing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last week's Budget speech, it was announced that the new deal would be expanded to benefit all over-25s who have been receiving jobseekers' allowance for more than 18 months. It was also announced that the new deal would be extended to lone parents. That is excellent news. In Wales, 50,000 people will benefit from that important change. In addition, it was announced that all claimants of invalidity benefit would be able to participate in the new deal. It is apparent that, under Labour, Wales has gone back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government have invested in the future of Wales by taking profits from fat cats and investing them in high-quality training for our young people, the disabled and the long-term unemployed. That will help to rebuild our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our communities will soon face a choice between the Tories—who would scrap the new deal—and Labour, which is extending it to cover lone parents and the long-term unemployed. The Conservative party left the young people of Wales on the scrapheap. The Labour Government have invested wisely to give them back their future and to enable them to use their talents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment in Wales is now lower than in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and employment is growing faster in Wales than in the UK as a whole. During the past year alone, 17,000 jobs have been created. The number of unemployed people claiming benefit has continued to fall. The latest figures cover the winter months, which is usually the worst period of the year, but they underline the fundamental strength of the Welsh economy; compared with last October, 1,800 fewer people are out of work. There are more people in work in Wales than ever before.

That growth in jobs did not happen by chance. It happened because the Government have delivered economic policies of stability, growth and low inflation. The Conservative party would take the country back to the days of boom and bust, and the shadow Chancellor said nothing in response to the Budget speech that will convince the people of Wales that the Tories have changed one iota since the days when he was an advocate of right-wing Thatcherite doctrine, the effects of which I have already outlined. Mortgage costs would rocket, thousands would be faced with repossessions and unemployment would rise because he would scrap the new deal and end
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
measures to make work pay, such as the working families tax credit and children's tax credit. The policies of our Government and the new announcements on pensions, the minimum wage and the 10p tax rate made in the Budget statement underline our commitment and ensure that Wales has its share of prosperity from the United Kingdom's economic cake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to touch on two areas of concern. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth movingly referred to the problems of steel jobs for his constituents. We have problems in north Wales, too, in that several hundred jobs will be lost if Corns does not negotiate meaningfully with the Government, the Assembly and the unions during the remaining two months of the consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that Sir Brian Moffat came before the Welsh Affairs Committee and had a rough ride, although he did not tell us why it was necessary to lose so many jobs within Wales. The fundamental issue seems to lie in the amalgamation of Corus with a Dutch company, giving the shareholders of British Steel a £700 million handout. That sum would have kept British Steel going for two years, even at the losses that it was making. It might have met a peak in the cycle and not have lost any jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Brian Moffat sat in the Committee and showed no concern for the 6,000 who were losing their jobs, because he, as a shareholder in Corus, had given himself a nice little handout before the merger with Hoogovens. That is at the nub of why he does not care; he is sitting pretty, thank you very much. When he comes before the Select Committee again, that will be forcefully pointed out to him, along with many other things that we are finding out as time goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have referred to the foot and mouth epidemic, which is a tremendous problem for not only agriculture, but tourism. The Select Committee is trying to establish why Wales, although it has a good image, does not have as prominent an image as Scotland and Ireland. I am afraid that we will have an even bigger problem if tourism is affected by foot and mouth as it seems it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget contained measures for rural areas, including a cut in fuel duty, which will help many people in my constituency who have to travel for whatever reason. As we know, there is little or no public transport, so that measure will help those people. Similarly, the cut in the road licence fee for cars up to 1500 cc will help those who have to travel by car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sections of the rural community who criticise the way in which the Government are tackling the foot and mouth problem are wrong to do so. It has been decided that the way chosen by the Government is the only sensible way in which to keep Britain free of the disease. If the economic disbenefits of the foot and mouth disease policy were to be set against the disbenefits for tourism, it would be difficult to make a decision, especially if the disease reached an epidemic scale in this country. Those sections of the farming industry that criticise the Government should not do so.

I am sure that the Secretary of State would agree that the Government have a great deal left to do in Wales. Social exclusion in many parts of the nation, both north and south, remains a challenge for us all, but that challenge has been brought about by the legacy of failure to which I referred. The Government will not shirk that challenge; we have set out to rectify the failure of past Governments and, after four years of power, we are beginning to turn the corner. We have made a start on a long road to recovery and, in the coming months, I hope that the Welsh people will give us the chance to complete our journey for the benefit of everyone in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The House of Commons and the Welsh Grand Committee will be the poorer for your going and we wish you well in your retirement. The hon.

We do not yet live in a Soviet bloc totalitarian regime; constructive dialogue is always useful.

Agriculture and rural Wales are uppermost in all our minds. Farming has been in a crisis for a few years, but what is happening now is the worst crisis that it has faced in more than 60 years. I suspect that it is the worst crisis that any of us has seen. It has obvious and immediate consequences for farmers and those who rely on healthy agriculture. Added to those woes is foot and mouth, which has deeper complications and consequences for rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales relies tremendously on tourism. It is a beautiful country and attracts an enormous number of tourists throughout the year. The crisis has meant that the tourist industry is cautious about what it does; understandably so. It does not want to add to the plight of our agricultural areas. Several businesses, from bed-and-breakfast accommodation to hotels, are being affected. The postponement of rugby internationals has had enormous and immediate consequences for urban areas. Little tea rooms, coffee shops and gift shops rely on an influx of visitors to Wales; that is drying up. Several such businesses have been operating on the margins for years and they are now looking for some form of help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis is continuing and we read that the Government are considering the consequential damages of foot and mouth. I plead with the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
of State and the Minister to consider those businesses that are in danger of going under. Several operate on loans or mortgages from the bank. Their trade is drying up and they cannot survive for much longer. Without some support from the Government, they may go bankrupt and future tourism will be eroded. The outbreak will damage rural Wales enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman, as the Front-Bench spokesman for the Conservative party in Wales, giving an undertaking that a Conservative Government would help those sectors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a spirit of consensus, I say to the right hon. Gentleman that we recognise the depth of the problem in Wales. I shall certainly be making representations throughout my party that some form of compensation for consequential damages must be made in Wales where tourism in so important. Consideration must be given to those areas that rely on rural tourism. We know that such problems are not restricted to Wales; similar businesses face similar problems in parts of the Lake district, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are the Government of the day. The problems that exist are today's problems and I hope that the Government can do something about them. Yesterday, 	<i>The Observer</i> reported that business losses are about £100 million a week. That is an enormous body blow to several small businesses, perhaps family-run, that employ occasional staff. Some of them employ either the wives or families of those who rely on farming. On the one hand, they have been hit by the farming crisis; on the other, businesses that rely or depend on a healthy agriculture and rural life are being doubly hit. It is a deep crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Government to think again about their priorities. It is absurd to give legislative time to the attempt to ban hunting with dogs when we should be spending all our time on considering how we can help the agriculture industry. I hope that Lord Donoughue's suggestions will be given more serious consideration in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to stress that farming is in deep crisis. Incomes have dropped dramatically; in some cases, to well below the minimum wage. I hope that the Government will be more sensitive about the needs of farmers. In relation to foot and mouth, we should look again at what can be done to involve the Army in disposing of some of the stock that is lying around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget must be looked at in the context of other Budgets in the past four years. It is amazing that, within a few weeks of a general election, the Budget is handing some of the money back that has been taken away from families and people in Wales for the past four years. We know that the stealth taxes that have been introduced, one after the other—there have been about 45 during the past four years—have taken the equivalent of a 10p rise in income tax from the people of Wales. The Government are giving 1p back in this Budget, just weeks before a general election. We know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has tax raising form—it is in his blood, and it is his ethos—but, weeks before a general election, he is trying to go straight. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
the nightmare happened and the Labour party formed the next Government, the Chancellor will return to his tax-raising ways. We cannot allow that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural areas especially have been hit by tax rises on petrol and fuel; 16p on a litre over the past four years. The Budget has given 2p back, and we are supposed to start organising street parties to welcome this great news. We do not welcome it. A year ago, there was a 75p increase for pensioners. A few weeks before a general election, the increase is substantially greater. Again, we are supposed to start ringing the church bells in celebration of the Government becoming enlightened to the fact that the 75p increase last year was a gross insult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not the 75p increase precisely in line with the formula that was used for 18 years? Is not the £5 a week increase that pensioners will receive the biggest-ever rise in pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that the hon. Gentleman would use his opportunity to apologise for the 75p increase, and to say that the Government got it wrong and looked at the matter again. He must now learn that his party is in government and has control of the purse strings. It is interesting that, in the first few years, the Government were extremely frugal in relation to pensioners, but a few weeks before a general election they are doling the money out. I do not believe that the pensioners of Wales will be deceived for a single moment. They will judge the Government in the context of the past four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr's remarks about farming and those involved in hunting with hounds were completely insensitive. He was effectively saying, "Some jobs will be lost because of the ban on hunting with hounds, but those concerned can always go into other jobs that we are creating." Skilled people working in industries associated with hunting with hounds are doing what they want to do. I find it totally perplexing that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the fact that the Government are providing legislative time so that those jobs can be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there might be budgetary implications of the banning of hunting with dogs? The police might need enormously increased resources to look after the countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments. If the Government make something illegal, they must ensure that it is properly and effectively policed. There will have to be a further increase in police numbers; that will have cost implications, or the police will be pulled away from other duties. Violent crime has increased in Wales; the police should be concentrating their time on that, not on new crimes the creation of which means that the Government will persecute currently law-abiding citizens. That is completely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the announcement on VAT simplification for small businesses. We need to see the detail, because several smaller businesses, including my own in Swansea, spend a lot of time on paperwork and pay
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
accountants to do the paperwork with which they do not have time to deal. We need a simpler way of raising revenue, especially from smaller businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the announcement of the abolition of stamp duty in areas with genuine and severe problems, but it should be pointed out that the Government have increased stamp duty time and again. I shall not detail the problems that the Federation of Small Businesses listed in its document, as I have done so twice before. However, the lack of support for the plight of such businesses means that the matter deserves another airing; perhaps I shall do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a lot about job losses, especially in the manufacturing sector. Those job losses worry me. Admittedly, other jobs have been created, and we welcome those. Indeed, such changes took place under the previous Government, with jobs created to replace jobs lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manufacturing sector is proportionately more important to Wales than to other parts of the country. Last week the Chancellor could have provided an opportunity to reconsider the climate change levy and the impact that it will have on manufacturing jobs in particular. He lost that chance. I urge the Secretary of State to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider that impact. If manufacturing jobs are lost, other jobs—worthy though they may be—may not match up to the skills of some members of our manufacturing force. Those skills might attract other businesses to Wales. We need a strong manufacturing base, and it is being damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Budget, the Government could have done a great deal more to help families, as well as small businesses and manufacturing in Wales. After four years of tax rises and of rules and regulations, the Government—in one Budget, announced weeks before a general election—do a little to repair some of the damage that they did before. Some would say that it is a great shame that we do not have elections every year, because the Government might be a bit more careful and consider how to help the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past four years, council tax in Wales has increased well above inflation, and this year is no different. We welcome the transfer of responsibilities to local government, but funding is not always transferred in the same proportion. I was very unhappy with last year's use of the damping procedure, which hit rural areas in particular, including Monmouthshire and the Vale of Glamorgan, where council tax was pushed up further to provide money for some of the less prudent local authorities in Wales. The council tax bills of several councils are three or four times more than the current rate of inflation. I ask the Secretary of State and the Assembly to reconsider how they set priorities for local government. They are given money to pass on to local authorities, but the way in which they are caning rural areas in particular will not help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is a small step back at a time when the Government have done so much damage in Wales. All the Budgets should be taken together and consigned to Room 101, along with Anne Robinson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I may not have another chance to do so before the general election, whenever it will be, I thank you for being such a support and inspiration to several hon. Members, especially those who entered the House in 1997. You are an excellent ambassador for your area, and especially Flintshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that time is against me, but I welcome the Budget. I thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for speaking so eloquently and with such feeling about the social history of this area. One point that came through clearly was that the economy and society of these industrial valleys have had to embrace change. There is a lesson there. We are living in a world that is changing at a fast pace, and not just in our industrial communities. Those of us who live in and love our rural communities must accept the need for change there. Insufficient work has been done in that regard, especially in agriculture. People accept that agriculture is in crisis, and that the Government are dealing with foot and mouth in a practical way, but a long-term strategy for agriculture is needed. I know that the Government are giving priority to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central. His point about paying off the national debt in order to invest in youngsters today was original; I had not heard it made in such an effective way before. The main principle of this Government is to create social justice and a fairer society, and that is a strong principle. We should embrace and create a strong economy and control interest rates, which are low now due to the Government's economic success. We now have a much stronger economy than the one that we inherited from the Tories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the significance of the new deal. In my constituency, it has been of great benefit to hundreds of young people. The Government have made strong inroads into unemployment by moving people from dependency on benefit into work. That is a strong point of the Government's policies, which are on the right track, but we must also create jobs that make it pay to work. The Government can be proud of having introduced the minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency is highly dependent on tourism, in which pay has traditionally tended to be low. There is a problem with implementing the minimum wage policy that I hope that my right hon. Friend will note. I met a woman in Colwyn Bay who was working in a pub who told me that she was not getting the minimum wage. That was a disappointment and concern to me. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that enough is being done to police the minimum wage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that time is of the essence. I am happy that emphasis has been placed on measures that will renew and regenerate our community. Tax rebates and tax credits could be of benefit to areas such as Abergele and Colwyn Bay. The Government have achieved a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
great deal and more will be done if they are re-elected. If we can spread the word about their wonderful record, we can be confident that that will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to consider changes in education in the context of the Budget. Welsh lessons are held in this building, so Welsh education is another matter that comes to mind. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth referred to Caerleon school. I was there on Friday and a group of teachers are teaching children Welsh enthusiastically; for the first time, in my opinion. In the early 1970s, brave parents fought a long battle for their children to receive education in Welsh. We can now celebrate their success with the opening of a new school in the shadow of the Severn bridge, which I believe will be called "Ysgol y Ffin"—the border school. If money comes from the Budget to the Assembly, it is important to ensure that the present generation of Gwent children regain their inheritance, which has been denied them for decades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to the Budget's effect on people in the third world who face suffering each day of their lives. It is possible for the Chancellor to give £1 billion from the Budget to get rid of third world debt. Our Government's success means that we can repay debt. Next year, more debt will be paid back than has repaid during the past 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Continued in English]</i> People's jobs will collapse soon. A new atmosphere descended last weekend; hope is disappearing fast. I want to make a strong point to my friends in government. I read this morning that consequential compensation will be paid. Paradise has arrived. We are in the days of socialism when individuals or businesses that lose money are compensated by the Government. Is that happening? I welcome it. However, I want to put in a bid. I shall not talk for long about farmers, but one of the perverse things that could happen is that my steelworkers on modest incomes will lose their livelihood, may never work again and will receive redundancy pay that could be as little as a fifth of what is on offer in other countries in the European Community. At the same time, Sir Brian Moffat, who is a farmer, may receive compensation for losses that he may have suffered in the present crisis. Those are the two extremes of what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Continued in Welsh]</i> I wish to refer to people on small farms who speak Welsh. After the job losses in anthracite-producing areas, we must battle for the little farms in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>[Continued in English]</i> Eighty per cent. of the subsidies go to 20 per cent. of the farmers, some of whom are the richest and are running businesses worth many millions of pounds. There must be compensation, but it should be given on the basis of justice and not to save every business in the rural areas. Rural areas have a rich future, but great change will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
Tourism is not confined to rural areas; it is an industry also in urban areas. Tourism suffers ups and downs, feast and famine, as a result of weather changes and so on. If there is to be consequential compensation to one industry, it should not be provided for rural areas only. If we are now saying that compensation is for everyone who experiences losses that are not their fault, people in the steel industry should be eligible. What has happened to them is not their fault and, over the years, they have sacrificed, reskilled and done everything that they possibly can; as you know, Mr. Jones, from your experience. For internal, selfish reasons, the company has kicked them in the teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way to tackle such behaviour is for unions to work multinationally against multinational companies. The Government should be working with the Dutch and German Governments to ensure at least an equality of standards within the steel industry. What is happening at Llanwern and Ebbw Vale is not happening in Holland or Germany, although our standards of productivity are higher than theirs. If there are to be handouts, they should not go to one industry or group of industries, or to an industry in one area only. They should be given to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For years, I have represented people in urban areas. We know that the money goes to the squeaking wheel; perhaps we have not squeaked enough. Perhaps we should have demonstrated, protested and blocked the Severn bridge. If multi-millionaires who have vast businesses are to be compensated because they are threatened with bankruptcy—even though such threats are idle—our steelworkers should be compensated as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I welcome the money for extra public spending in Wales, particularly for education. We have heard banter about facts, figures and GDP. I wish to compare my experiences since becoming a Member of Parliament in 1997 with what happened during the previous 18 years, when I was a county councillor, a governor for two county schools and a parent in Pembrokeshire with three children. I care about children because they are our future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were occasions during those 18 years when I was almost in despair. I was a member of the parent-teacher association when my daughter and son were in junior school in Pembroke. We raised money for the school because of our concerns about the Conservative Government's cuts in education spending; only as a result of that fundraising was the school able to afford a new copy of the maths scheme for its pupils. I had to buy my daughter's literature book when she was studying for her GCSEs, because there were only four copies of that book for about 30 children. When I was a councillor, a ceiling in Neyland primary school fell down because of lack of maintenance. When I was a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
school governor in Pembroke dock, a school with 410 pupils had cardboard walls and difficulties with maintenance and heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Friday, I visited the construction site of a new school in St. Davids. It is being built in partnership with the church in Wales. I used to be a governor in Pembroke dock, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger). Again, there is a new school for that community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fishguard school in my constituency is gaining a new technology block and £750,000 worth of investment. Tasker Milward school in Haverfordwest has had a new sports hall and a new 10-classroom extension. Such things do not come about out of the blue. They come about because of a stable economy and investment by Government in public services. It is important because the children are our future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central spoke about the repayment of debt, about which some hon. Members complained this afternoon. It is only as a result of the repayment of debt that we have this money for spending on public services. For every £1 of extra public spending in 1997, 42p went on repayment of debt. That is now down to 16p. That is where the money is coming from for our children and their future. That must be good for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have often wondered whether I should table a question to all Departments asking which hon. Member has led more missions to Ministers. I am sure that you would win every time. I should also like to pay tribute to all those hon. Members who are retiring. Without going into detail, they have all played a distinctive part in our lives at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not look at the Budget in isolation as many hon. Members have tried to do, claiming that it is some sort of sweetener for the election that may be held some time during the next year. We must look at it in the context of all the Budgets produced by our Chancellor who will go down as one of the top three Chancellors of the past 150 years. His Budgets have provided sustainable and stable expansion. They have led to the creation of more jobs in Wales, despite the difficulties in particular industries. In my constituency, steel comes to mind, and there are problems in the furniture industry. On the other hand there is success at Ford. The overall picture is one of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider the help that the Government have provided for small businesses, not just with the announcements in this Budget, but with the drop in corporation tax for large and small businesses and the fact that business taxes in Britain are 25 per cent. less than those of our major competitors in the European Union. Moreover, let us not forget the proposals in this Budget to try to encourage further investment in research and development. The Government are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
preparing Britain for the 21st century in a way that it has never been prepared before and they are seeking to give the regions and nations of the United Kingdom a far greater role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the additional money for the public services, which again is only provided because of the way in which the Government have responded to the demands of the 21st century. I should like the Assembly to make speedy decisions to ensure that the extra money for education and health is handed out in the quickest most cost-effective way possible. I know from schools in my constituency and from the Bro Morgannwg NHS trust that it could be well spent without any difficulty to provide a better education and health service for children, young people and adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the impact of the Budget on individuals and families. It has not been targeted particularly at middle England. It tries to do something for everybody, but particularly for lower paid people, people struggling to get qualifications or into work, and pensioners, who have been given the best deal in the history of the old age pension. The commitment to them is not just for this year; they have been awarded an above-inflation increase for next year. The Budget also creates record low mortgage rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much additional spending power has been put into the Welsh economy? I imagine that it is phenomenal, and it all helps local businesses. The Chancellor is not stop-go, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy claimed. Indeed, the Government are determined to build up the economy and are giving three-year forecasts of future expenditure. The National Assembly received 8.2 per cent. more last year and 6.5 per cent. more this year, and it will receive 10.2 per cent. more next year and 7.1 per cent. more the year after that. That money, which has increased way above inflation, will provide public services in Wales. I look forward to the election, whenever it is held, because I know that there will be another convincing Labour victory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Women and children have never been at the centre of a Budget in the way that they are in this one. I welcome what my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central said about maternity leave, paternity leave and adoption leave. This is the first Government to have placed children and families at the heart of their policies—the previous Government would not even sign the European directive on parental leave. I am sorry that their representative is not present to defend that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday, I visited the University hospital of Wales and attended the opening of the leading paediatric intensive care unit—which provides a good
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
reason to talk up Wales and its achievements. The unit, which is a centre of excellence, was funded by extra money from the Assembly and treats children from south Wales, west Wales and England. Tanny Gray, a constituent of mine who was brought up in the Heath hospital in Cardiff, opened the unit and spoke about her experiences; she said that the Heath hospital was where she used to do her training. She talked about the five or six days of training she had done there and then about the good care she had received in the spina bifida unit of the Heath hospital. She was an inspiration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is re-distributive, giving money where it is most needed. If we have an election in a few weeks or a few months—whenever it is—the people of Wales will recognise that the Government have put their money where it is needed and are committed to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (Translation)	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse all that has been said to you today, Mr. Jones, and I wish you well when you leave the special palace where we usually perform. I sincerely hope that you enjoy your life back in politics, as another hon. Member said. It is also appropriate that I should pay my respects to others, such as the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon, who are retiring from Parliament, but not from politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting debate today. The election is on the horizon and it is obvious that people are preparing for it. The Secretary of State's statement was interesting in adopting a historical view of the valley that he represents, but he did not acknowledge that it has reached its present position only after many longstanding crises and problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main weakness of the Budget is that is focused on the UK rather than the Welsh economy. Wales is starting to crumble, suffering from the disappearance of 20,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector and 6,000 in the agricultural sector. The Budget fails to foresee what will happen in Wales over the next two or three years. What is missing is that it has not prepared us enough for what is to come. The Budget may be a perfect answer to the present position, but it does not address the circumstances of the 165 women in Lampeter, for example, who will lose their jobs at Dewhurst. The Budget will not help such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget fails to mention cuts in corporation tax or the contributions of employers to create new jobs. The Budget is all right in what it seeks to do, but does not address the true needs of Wales. However, the Budget includes some useful provisions. At one point I thought that the Chancellor, having recently married, would make a personal announcement about a baby bonus through family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru and I welcome the elements of the Budget that truly apply to Wales as well as to other parts of the UK, but there are some deficiencies. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire offered a clear analysis of the Budget as a reasonable measure, but falling short of the mark with respect to Wales. He spoke about tuition fees—unfortunately, the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
Member for Ribble Valley did not say how the Conservatives would pay for their new policy in Wales—long-term care and the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget represents a lost opportunity to achieve more with the billions invested in Railtrack. Bit by bit, we should buy it back, although I do not mean total renationalisation. We could turn the £9 billion into company shares and bring 51 per cent. back into the public sector. The sooner that is done, the sooner we shall have the better transport system for which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire yearned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his square mile, the hon. Member for Monmouth talked about Labour's achievements in the past, but he drew a veil over some episodes for which Labour are responsible. They are a Conservative Government with a capital or small "c". That is the main deficiency. Although £4 billion of the £23 billion is now being spent on public services, it is late in the day. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire hit the nail on the head when he said that it was a Budget for an election in two or three years' time, which might be when the present Chancellor is Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another omission from the analysis was a reassessment of the Barnett formula. It is interesting and revealing that the only defence that we have heard for the current system of tying Wales with England and Scotland, on a parliamentary level in Scotland, by the Assembly in Wales and a full Parliament in England, is Barnett. We are told that we cannot do things because of the Barnett formula. Something worked out by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury 20 years ago is now a basis for the British constitution. That is a poor defence. During the next few years, people in Wales will find it a weak reason for continuing with the current system. My hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy talked clearly about how match funding underlines and undermines any arguments for keeping the Barnett formula as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members, such as the hon. Members for Cardiff, Central—I think that something is bothering him—and for Cardiff, North, have contributed in their usual way to today's debate and talked of personal experiences. However, I want to refer to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and the relationship between the Liberal Democrats and Labour. As Tom Jones said, it is not unusual, it happens all the time. Perhaps we can see something developing, but something odd is happening at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have lost an opportunity. On Tuesday, the Prime Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"The evidence grows daily of the danger of indifference to our duty to treat nature with respect and care for our environment."</p></q>
Unfortunately, however, we did not have a Budget to meet that challenge. We have had £100 million for alternative crops and energy, which I very much welcome, but we must accept that the fuel policy is nonsense. I know that we need to cut vehicle excise duty somewhat to help rural areas, but we must face the issue of what to do where traffic is at its worst, in the middle of cities where there are traffic jams and poor air quality. We have heard no ideas in that respect. A way out would be to encourage more
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
development and to use biodiesel, hydrogen and, temporarily, liquid petroleum gas. That, too, has not been encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry, but I have only two minutes left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen some money to encourage the use of those fuels. For example, biodiesel will receive a substantial cut in tax, but in two years' time. Why not now? The technology exists, and the infrastructure is starting to be put together—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members say that biodiesel is not on the market, but every diesel car on the market now can run on 85 per cent. biodiesel. Diesel cars were developed in Germany to run on vegetable oil, so it can be used now. There is no point waiting for two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the tax on aggregates, which makes sense in itself when one thinks about not allowing people to mine. But the way it has been put together encourages people to mine old mines. That has been counted as recycling and will pose a problem. The hon. Member for Gower is not present. He might have something to say about dredging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are environmental deficiencies, but the issue of the moment is foot and mouth. There was nothing in the Budget to alleviate the current situation and the reasons for that are obvious. We do not know the extent of the problem yet. It may be controlled or it may increase and become a bigger problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a unique relationship in Wales between agriculture and the environment and between the rural economy and tourism. It has been argued, as a few hon. Members tried to argue today, that one can differentiate between them, but that is not possible. Tourists come to Wales to see what our farmers have created. We cannot differentiate between them. Tourism is suffering too. I am glad that the Urdd has reopened in Llangranog in my constituency. It has lost more than £150,000 in two weeks, which shows the effect of the problems on the tourist industry. We must not create or allow a split to develop between tourism and agriculture where one side says, "We are claiming compensation," and the other says, "No, you cannot have compensation because we do not get any." What is needed at the end of all this is a package for rural areas. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, we need guidelines for the tourist industry on what can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in the tributes to your chairmanship, Mr. Jones, and to your nearly 31 years in the House of Commons representing Alyn and Deeside and the Flintshire constituency.

Members I should like to thank Monmouthshire county council, the House of Commons authorities, including 	<i>Hansard</i> staff, the door keepers, the police and all the

others who have helped us here today. I am tempted, given the nature of the debate, to thank the returning officer too, but perhaps we shall leave that for the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past four years the Government's prime aim has been to build a platform of economic stability. Our discussions on the Budget have related to that platform. We have tried to take a balanced approach between making resources available for greater public investment in education and the health service while making targeted tax changes that have helped the poorest members of our society most. I reflected on what my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North and for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr said about that. Through the tax cuts, we are trying to help the disadvantaged and the poorest in our community, and to lift children out of poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with hon. Members' contributions, I want to reflect on what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor did for people in Wales in last week's Budget. There is extra money for education and health—£100 million over and above last year's comprehensive spending review—and there is extra money for fighting drugs. The Chancellor has targeted investment on tax cuts with the 10p income tax band, which helps those who earn the lowest incomes, and the children's tax credit will rise from £10 a week in April 2001 to £20 a week in April 2002. There is also a rise in the working families tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maternity pay has been increased, and maternity cover extended—moves that are especially important to women in our community, as my hon. Friends have said—and the introduction of paternity leave will also help at the pressured time when children are first born. The minimum wage has been increased to £4.10 an hour, and rural and urban areas will be helped by cuts in petrol tax duty of 2p a litre on ultra low sulphur petrol and 3p a litre on ultra low sulphur diesel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the Government's actions in this and previous Budgets, from October 2001, families with children in Wales will be £1,000 better off, and such families in the poorest fifth of the population will be £1,700 better off. Real changes are being made because of the Budget, including such measures as the extension of the new deal, the increase in the minimum wage, changes in national insurance contributions and the help being given to lone parents, the disabled, partners of the unemployed and the over-50s. The balance of power in Wales is being shifted in favour of the poorer members of our community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, change is occurring in economic stability, the creation of jobs and the fall in unemployment. The investment that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has outlined—£100 million extra—will be targeted at real things, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mrs. Lawrence) said. It will make real differences in schools and hospitals throughout Wales. On that basis alone, we should commend the Budget to hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
I shall try to respond to as many as possible of the various points that hon. Members have made, although time is limited. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire in his pending retirement. Foot and mouth was the key issue that he raised, and I can tell all hon. Members who mentioned foot and mouth that the Government's main aim is to eradicate it as quickly as possible, and to ensure that we examine the implications for farmers, when that involves the killing of animals. Farmers will receive the full market value for slaughtered animals. The Government have quickly made available £156 million of agrimoney compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Real problems surround foot and mouth. However, we start from the basis of trying to eradicate it, and I hope that hon. Members agree with that. I represent a rural area, as do many other hon. Members, and we all urgently want to see foot and mouth eradicated. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth drew attention to his concern that the MAFF helpline for foot and mouth was shut at the weekend. I am assured that three Assembly helplines, advertised on its website, were open from 10 am to 4 pm during the weekend. I used one yesterday to raise concerns in my constituency about foot and mouth, so I hope that that reassures him. My hon. Friend paid tribute to the help that the Budget gives to families. The minimum wage, the new deal and the working families tax credit are important in his constituency, as elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset, who has had to leave, said that ultra low sulphur petrol is not available in Wales. However, from 1 April, it is expected to be available at 96 per cent. of major retail sites and more than 80 per cent. of total sites in Wales. By 1 June, we expect 100 per cent. of petrol stations in Wales to have ultra low sulphur petrol available and we have cut the rate of tax on non-leaded petrol to compensate for the period during which ultra low sulphur petrol is not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman criticised the Government's performance on education and national health service waiting lists. I leave you with one thought, Mr. Jones. How will the Conservative party tackle those issues when they have given a pledge to cut taxes and public spending?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr referred to child poverty and emphasised the strong economy. There are difficulties with Dewhursts, Dairy Crest and Valeo, which border his constituency, but the strong economy, low inflation, low interest rates, and investment are key elements in helping to restructure and reform our economy. His reference to Plaid Cymru and its economic arguments were spot on. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) has said many times that the cost of independence to our public services will be rejected by the people of Wales when the election comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy referred to Corus. He knows the situation and our concern about it, but we await with interest the comments of Sir Brian Moffat. He surprised me—my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will also be surprised—when he said that there was no new money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
in the Budget for objective 1 funding. If he thinks that there is no new money in the Budget, he is not a nationalist, but a Dutchman. The Budget includes new money for objective 1 funding. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State fought very hard for that new money. It is British Government money to support objective 1 funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot, because of the time. The right hon. Gentleman has been absent for a large part of the debate, but not for as long as his party leader, who will be fighting for his seat at Westminster in the general election shortly, but cannot be bothered to come to our debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central referred to the repayment of £34 billion of national debt. His comments were important and valuable, as were his comments about the Liberal Democrats. We all share collective responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire referred to compensation for foot and mouth disease. The Government are considering a range of issues, but no decisions have been made. Full consultation is under way, but the starting principle is that compensation is not given for consequential losses. We are discussing with the industry the possibility of insurance-based arrangements. Many of our constituents are affected and we recognise the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the euro and he knows the five tests. He also knows that, unlike the Conservative party, we shall give the people of Wales a choice in due course.My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) referred to the new deal, which is vital in creating wealth and support. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) referred to implementation of the national minimum wage. The Department of Trade and Industry has made 290 visits to Wales to check on enforcement. It has recovered £192,000 of money for low-paid workers and many enforcement orders have been issued. Again, I must tell the Committee that the minimum wage would not exist but for my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley said that the Chancellor should give the money back in tax cuts. If that money were given back, what public services would be taken back? Spending cuts would have to be made in the number of police, educational establishments, nurses and doctors. That is crucial. If the Conservative party goes into the election promising tax cuts, it must go into it promising public spending cuts. We need to know where those cuts will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire referred to investment in education, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. We have had a positive debate on those issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are proud of the Budget, which invests in education, health and public services, and shifts the balance to the poorest members of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
community with the working families tax credit, the minimum wage and a range of other measures. We must contrast that with the measures proposed by the hon. Members for Ribble Valley and for North Dorset—public spending cuts, lack of interest in services in Wales, and tax cuts that will damage the infrastructure and economy of Wales. To hon. Members from the nationalist party I say that independence would mean further cuts in services in Wales.
