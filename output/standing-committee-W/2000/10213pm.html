	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I appeal for brief speeches so that all hon. Members who seek to take part in the debate can do so. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. I was asked this morning whether I would ask for Councillor Simon Glyn to be sacked from his post as chair of the housing committee in Gwynedd. In response, I said that I would find it personally difficult, but that this was a matter for "the local party to decide" and the local party alone. The Under-Secretary and his hon. Friends have construed that to mean that I called for that person to be sacked. I did no such thing. If the Committee is to be worth anything as a forum, it should not allow such misconstruction or outright lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note your appeal for brevity, Mr. Jones; if only you had made it this morning at the start of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) with some amazement. Given the doubling of crime under the Conservative Government, the axing of many of the resources of Customs and Excise, the fall in the number of police officers, the disaster of the Tories' care in the community policy, which led to the death of at least one of my constituents, and their apparent failure to act successfully on drugs in prison, and given how adamant the hon. Gentleman claims to be about law and order, I am surprised that he is still a member of the Conservative party. As an aside, I must say that my amazement turned to almost irresistible curiosity about where the £16 billion might be found; I presume that the Tories have a convincing photocopier at party headquarters, because the figures do not add up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have heard many statistics, safety is as much about hard facts as it is about attitudes or a state of mind. In essence, it has four elements—jobs, health, the dangers associated with daily life, and crime. On jobs, I need not emphasise how easy it is for people to feel insecure if they do not know whether they can provide for themselves and their families. On health, knowing that one has to care for oneself as well as for
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
others can lead to insecurity in the community, especially if one fears that vulnerability, pain or other debilitating factors will get in the way. In essence, health is about quality of life, and the fear that health provision will be insufficient is every bit as debilitating as the absence of health provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dangers of living include matters such as pollution, and road transport. In the absence of the relatively safe methods of public transport that are enjoyed in many urban areas, rural Wales is laid open to danger by the dangerous state of some of our roads. With crime, we should think not only of the victims of crime but about what happens to them after the crimes have been perpetrated. Only yesterday, I was speaking with two constituents, one of whom—Mrs Crompton—has seen her family collapse as a direct result of the murder of one of her offspring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safety goes far beyond the crime itself; it includes the aftercare received by victims of crime. The criminals themselves are sometimes victims of circumstance, and the community should also seek to rehabilitate rather than to punish those who fall by the wayside and engage in disreputable means of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider how we are doing in those four elements. It seems clear that the loss of a job is one of the greatest strains that one can experience. We have talked much of the considerable job losses associated with Corns and other big employers. Let us not forget that small companies such as that formerly known as BSK in Llanidloes also employ Welsh people. All individuals in small or large companies who lose their jobs have the same right to feel concerned about their future. When we think about jobs in the context of building a safer community, we have to consider big and small companies, the macro and the micro. The same is true of farming, which now has the highest suicide rates of any industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is an ageing society. There are some good reasons for that, such as the fact that we live longer. The ageing of our population will exacerbate the strain on social and health services. Sparsity has been alluded to already. Waiting lists and the insecurity of not knowing whether treatment will become available before a condition worsens add to concerns about vulnerability and security in local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next points are about living dangerously. Transport safety might be a weakness. A more effective means of transport might be expensive for Wales, but we have some way to go to provide a public transport service that means that individuals can safely travel round Wales, and that those who do not have private transport do not live in isolation in their homes. That often leads to insecurity and a sense of tremendous vulnerability. The treacherous Llanymynech road, the main north-south road in Wales, goes through a small town. It is a real danger to the residents, who feel that the population has been cut in half by a road that carries more than 10,000 vehicles a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime figures vary. It is to the credit of the Government that we are blessed with encouraging conditions, as things seem to be getting better. Certainly in mid-Wales, I thank the Government for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
having spent sufficient money to herald a genuine decrease in overall crime. Violent crime is a concern, as it forms a high percentage of crime in rural Wales and Wales as a whole. One reason why the percentage is so high is that overall crime is quite low. That is not a reason for complacency, but we must reassure the listening public, who will no doubt read the report of our proceedings assiduously, that Wales is not an especially violent place to live. Police are doing well, but rural crime is another concern. The remoteness of farms and so forth leads to specific threats to livelihood and resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drugs, within which I include alcohol, are a terrible scourge. I am sad to see that drug abuse is beginning to creep into our small towns. I shall consider the causes of that briefly, but we must tackle head-on the reasons why people take drugs if we are to ensure safety in our communities. That involves more than simply punishing individuals for doing something that is occasionally the only way out of a miserable existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the genome project, because the question was asked whether crime was genetic. If it were, we could not do much about it. I read with fascination that all human beings are apparently almost identical, which means, I am sorry to say, that we are almost identical to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. I have to believe that political affiliation is environmental, not genetic, otherwise there is no hope for the hon. Gentleman. On the assumption that crime has environmental causes, it must have environmental solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can we do to fix the problem? We must build a partnership in Wales between politicians and the people. That means that we must sometimes build partnerships between parties on issues such as crime. I do not enjoy the ceaseless efforts of some individuals to score party political points about crime, given that the Conservative Government failed to make anything about the issue a reality other than its doubling. If we stop reminding people of that, perhaps others will stop trying to score points as well, so that we can make crime a cross-party issue. I am sure that when people's houses are burgled, they do not find interesting party politicians' attacks on one another. We need, first of all, to tackle the actuality of crime, including bullying, child abuse and so forth. The Children's Commissioner for Wales is a great step forward. On drugs, we must work with the probation service, which regards itself as underfunded in Wales, so that it can prevent as well as cure the problems, by reapplying its knowledge to those at risk of offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also create some sort of crime link, whereby communities help those who have fallen into drug use, mainly through depression or despair, to find reasons not to reoffend. We should make the incentive not to reoffend more powerful than the incentive to backslide. We should consider restorative justice, whereby one builds a community that helps itself, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
helps those who have previously been involved in crime to develop a sense of responsibility and respect, and to feel rewarded for doing what is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Closed circuit television is much demanded. I have doubts about that, because it simply displaces the problem. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that it works in Cardiff, and we should consider that. I am against extensive DNA testing on a continuing basis, because we might begin to assume that we can judge criminals by their DNA, and that we do not have environmental solutions for the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to any potential violence during the FA cup, we should all support Leicester City, because the club has some of the most docile and supportive fans in the country. Were the club to go to Wales and to Cardiff, it would not only win the FA cup but bring peace and tranquillity. I note the shocked expression on the face of the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), whose football allegiance clearly differs from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My underlying point on crime is that we need to find solutions to the causes, not just to the symptoms. With jobs, we must ensure that there is true investment. As I said before, we should consider both macro and micro—not only Corus, but BSK; not only farming but individual farmers. I am working on the assumption that it is cheaper for us to stop job losses than to support the individuals concerned through social security and sometimes through bankruptcy, which often ensues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give the Assembly the money that it needs to provide the health service that Wales requires. In Scotland, thanks to the Liberal Democrats convincing their Labour partners, there is now a commitment to free health care. Perhaps we should consider that for Wales, too, but the money needs to come from Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On transport, we require better roads and more projects like the Sarn-y-Bryn Caled junction, which I worked to secure in partnership with the then Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain). Statistically, that roundabout saves probably six lives a year. We need more projects like that, which recognise that if one values a human life at £1 million, as the NHS does, one quickly gets one's money back by investing in better roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be interested to hear that I am shortly to introduce a ten-minute Bill on rail compensation. That should provide a good incentive for safer, but faster and more reliable rail links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Robert Owen believed in all the things that I am describing, and believed that human behaviour was a condition of the environment, as the conclusions of the genome project imply. He was born not in the last few years, not even in the last century, but in 1771. He was the architect of the co-operative movement, and in many ways, he was the father of much of what was socialism for over a century, although his ideas were somewhat stolen by others, for which I will not forgive them. His concept was the same as that which I have described. He believed in giving people work, good health, safe living conditions and an education, and he believed that if he did those things he would generate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
a community of good citizens with a sense of mutual respect and values. In New Lanark, he achieved that model—it was more than just theory. To him, the duty of the Government towards citizens was to educate people to aspire to be the best that they could be, and to build safe communities in which they felt comfortable. That is our goal as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us will have visited the statue of Robert Owen in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Does he agree that Sir Brian Moffatt could do no better than to visit the hon. Gentleman's constituency and learn about Robert Owen, which would not only do something for the communities of Sir Brian's employees but might actually make him into a businessman of Owen's stature?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. We all have a lot to learn, and I would gladly give any hon. Member a free guided tour should they come to Newtown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our goals should to be similar to the laudable goals of Robert Owen. He had a vision, and he turned it into action. His actions could be regarded as building a safer community, as at New Lanark. Let us take his example and use it to make our communities better, stronger and safer, with true partnership between the Government and the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out in his excellent speech this morning, creating safer communities involves a range of issues. Those include creating the climate for full employment, providing people with decent wages rather than poverty pay, and helping people to buy their own homes or to rent decent houses. It is important to recognise that fact, since the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) started his speech by apparently denying it, seeking instead to restrict the debate to a narrower area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is wrong. We were talking about building safer communities, and I concentrated on policing. There is nothing wrong with that. I did not seek to deny anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to the point of order that he made at the beginning of this morning's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Creating safer communities must involve bringing together all elements of those communities to work together. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has personally condemned the divisive, not to say racist, comments of Councillor Simon Glyn. It is one thing for an individual Member of Parliament to reject the comments on a personal level, but what is needed is action by the party to prove its rejection of them. So far, that has not happened. That can only mean that protestations about what Councillor Glyn
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
said are merely crocodile tears. Only action by the party to censure its senior member will demonstrate that such racist comments must not be tolerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am sure that we all agree that the utterances of the person to whom my hon. Friend referred are repugnant and alien to any kind of libertarian movement, I do not think that she should be particularly surprised by them. Does not such behaviour simply reflect the history of the movement, which began some 75 years ago? The two big hates of Saunders Lewis were the English and the Jews; his big loves were Hitler and Mussolini. During the second world war, the Welsh nationalist party protested against children coming into Wales to escape the bombing in England. They claimed that that was one of the greatest threats ever to Welsh civilisation and culture. Should we therefore be surprised by recent events? If the man in question is repugnant, all he is doing is reflecting the history of his party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a background in researching such things, but I am afraid that I do not share his knowledge. I came into Wales, married a Welshman and learned the Welsh language. My children are educated through the medium of Welsh and my son was, until recently, a member of a Welsh rock band. I think that I have demonstrated my commitment to the country in which I live. However, if one is committed to the country of Wales, one must acknowledge that the future of the language relies on winning the good will of English-speaking people in Wales, whether they come from elsewhere or are English speakers who have lost the Welsh language over generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three main elements involved in building safer communities in Wales—or anywhere else for that matter. Those elements are the police, the local authority and other agencies, and the community itself. They form the basis of the crime reduction partnerships introduced by the Government to help combat crime and the fear of crime, which, for some people, is just as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police force in my corner of Wales—Dyfed Powys—has an excellent performance record. Crime in Dyfed Powys is less than half the national average and the force's clear-up rate is 95 per cent. Those figures were published in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> last month, and have been referred to by other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I arrived in Westminster, I have pursued the issue of sparsity in police funding because I well recall the discussions and evidence that showed the extra costs involved in rural policing from my time as a member of Dyfed Powys police authority. For that reason, I was pleased that the Government gave £4.5 million to Welsh police forces to cover the extra costs of rural policing. Dyfed Powys, which covers more than half of the landmass of Wales, has benefited considerably from that funding. West Wales anticipates taking on extra officers with that money and there are plans to reopen some rural police
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
stations in order to provide the permanent police presence that has been missing for so long because of Tory funding cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a participant in the police service parliamentary scheme this year, I was privileged to spend some time with Carmarthen police division on operational duty just outside my constituency. For a week, I worked the same shift patterns as the police officers and accompanied them on a variety of duties. It was enlightening. Comparing Carmarthen at midnight on a Friday with its sleepy market-town image during the day brought to mind Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as accompanying officers on night shift in Carmarthen, I accompanied a rural officer on his round of villages, meeting local people and discussing their concerns. We visited the homes of individuals who had applied for shotgun licences; we had to interview them or walk their land to ensure that no danger would be posed to passing walkers or motorists. That work took a large chunk out of the officer's day. It seems sensible to suggest that the Home Office should consider employing retired police officers to do that administrative work. They have the necessary training and background as police officers, but serving officers would be relieved of the bureaucracy and be free to deal with crime and other policing issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent a day with criminal intelligence officers and half a day with a police patrol vehicle. I observed a meeting between social services staff and the divisional superintendent, Bill Home, who has since been appointed assistant chief constable in Gwent—Gwent's gain is our loss in west Wales. That meeting was held to discuss contingency measures for monitoring sex offenders who are released into the community. As a politician, I was reassured to see both agencies working together to protect our children. I accompanied acting inspector Carol Evans and some special constables on traffic duty at the United Counties agricultural show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that week, I gained first-hand knowledge of the difficulties and demands that our police officers have to face. I congratulate them on their dedication and on the service that they deliver to the people of Wales. That experience was an eye-opener; it was the other side of the coin from my experience as a member of the police authority. It was good to see the police implementing the policing plan for which that authority had been responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police, in dealing with the prevention and detection of crime, are only part of the story. Our local authorities have a major role. Housing and environmental health, social services and economic development departments of local councils have a crucial role in creating safer communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that every hon. Member here today will be aware that a major factor for many people, particularly those who live on council estates, is neighbourhood nuisance. Before 1997, as a county councillor, I recall hearing of the frustration of people who had to cope with the noise and nuisance of
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
neighbours. I also knew of the difficulties that faced the environmental health departments when trying to bring such cases to court. The perpetrators would often have their noisy equipment confiscated by the court, but they would simply buy more equipment and continue to make their neighbours' lives a misery.

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 gave us antisocial behaviour orders and parenting orders, which we thought might deal with such problems. Indeed, the mechanics exist to deal with antisocial behaviour, but it is extremely disappointing that local authorities and the police do not appear to be pursuing such cases as vigorously as one would wish. I understand that Wrexham is the only local authority in Wales to have implemented such an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some residents in my constituency are up in arms following a tragic incident on their estate. I shall not mention that case because it is sub judice. Suffice it to say that it could have been avoided if the local authority had taken action sooner by implementing the powers in the 1998 Act to tackle neighbour nuisance. It is not an extreme measure; it is a tool to make people realise that they and their entire families have a responsibility to behave decently to their neighbours. In recent discussions, Pembrokeshire county council confirmed that it intended to pursue tenancy conditions vigorously in such cases in the future and to work with the police to use ASBOs as a preventive measure. I shall be monitoring that in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) mentioned this morning another interesting development—acceptable behaviour contracts and parental control agreements. Those are being introduced by the Islington crime reduction partnership as an easier way of implementing ASBOs. They will be used as a tool rather than a weapon. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) was at pains to point out that Islington council is controlled by the Liberal Democrats, but my constituents will not care who is responsible for the ideas, so long as they are effective. Perhaps it is a real example of consensus government. I shall forward details of that initiative to my local authority in the hope that our local crime reduction partnership will consider following that course, particularly in areas like The Mount in Milford Haven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), who is not here this afternoon, referred to his recent visit to council housing estates. I know that one of the estates that he visited was in my constituency. He said that tenants and residents wanted more say and complained that antisocial residents were located among decent families. That is indeed the compliant of many of my constituents, and I have dealt with it in some detail. However, the hon. Gentleman should have known that the years of cuts to council housing budgets in Wales were caused by poor local government settlements during those Tory years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities used to set aside specific areas for particular tenants—pensioners' bungalows are a prime example; elderly people like to live in relative quiet—but the previous Government's refusal to allow
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
local authorities to invest in new homes and to repair property resulted in fewer homes being available for pensioners. The pressure on housing stock meant that the councils did not have the opportunity to allocate housing for specific purposes. The council could only struggle to provide homes. That is the real cause of many of the problems that ordinary, decent people on housing estates are forced to endure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most important element in creating safer communities is the involvement of the community itself. One of the reasons why Dyfed Powys has been so successful in combating crime is that we in west Wales have a good sense of community. People care about others who live in their village, street or neighbourhood. By tapping into that good citizenship, communities can prevent and combat crime. That can be done either though neighbourhood watch schemes or the projects now being funded by the Welsh Assembly on council estates. Those projects give tenants and residents a real say in how their estates should be managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further co-ordination is needed between the community planning aspects of crime reduction, which are the responsibility of local government and therefore of the Assembly, and the Home Office crime and disorder strategies. The community planning aspect works on a four-year cycle, whereas the Home Office crime and disorder strategy operates on a three-year cycle. Dyfed Powys police say that it is important that those two strategies are co-ordinated on either a three or a four-year cycle as quickly as possible, to ensure that they operate fully in tandem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to say that Milford Haven has recently been successful in gaining funding from the National Assembly to establish a project to help residents on The Mount estate. The tenants and residents there are keen to improve their area; they now have the funding to make it happen and to restore confidence in their community. At lunchtime, I spoke to a representative from Dyfed Powys, who said that the future looks good. However, he raised three small points about that funding that need further examination. First, we need to make the money available to all communities. Some communities that would benefit from the funding are too small, and do not reach the criteria. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secy investigate that problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the representative stressed that funding should be available for a minimum of three years rather than one. Capital funding is fine, but it sometimes has revenue implications for the local authorities. Finally, he believed that we need to know for how much time communities have to submit bids in specific funding rounds. I ask my hon. Friend to raise those matters with the Home Secretary and the First Minister of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those things can happen only if the Government are committed to the principle of safer communities. They will not happen if there is talk but no action. The Opposition may talk today about crime and dealing with crime, but their record in office was appalling. Many of my hon. Friends will be keen to remind the Committee that crime doubled between 1979 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
1997. At the same time, cautions and convictions decreased by 6 per cent. In 1979, the chance of being burgled was one in 32, but in 1995, before the Tories left office, it was one in 13. In 1979, the chance of being a victim of car crime, a subject raised this morning by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, was one in 11, but in 1995 it was one in six. The chance of being a victim of violence was one in 213 in 1979, but one in 73 in 1995. The hon. Gentleman talked about the continued rise in violent crime figures, but he will find that the rate of increase has fallen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it entirely surprising that during those years more people resorted to crime? Our young people were left on the scrap heap. They could not find work and faced a bleak future with no prospects. Some households in my constituency had had no one in full-time work for three generations. Unemployment throughout the United Kingdom topped 3 million. Some unscrupulous employers thought nothing of paying their workers £2 an hour and relying on the state to boost their income to minimum levels. Interest rates hit 15 per cent., with record mortgage repayments and house repossessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that, unfortunately, the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) is not with us this afternoon. He mentioned the need to remove the differential in the minimum wage. Where were Plaid Cymru Members when the issue was voted on in the House? I recall that Labour Members sat through the night to secure the implementation of the measure for our constituents, but Plaid Cymru Members appeared to have gone home, by all accounts. They certainly did not stay to vote at 8 o'clock the next morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the impact of the Tory years and the detriment that they caused our communities and society. Margaret Thatcher may famously have said that there was no such thing as society, but it was society that paid the price during those years. For two decades, people were in fear for their jobs and homes, and feared being victims of crime. The key to safer communities is partnerships and real jobs. Youth unemployment in my constituency has gone down by 81 percent. since 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum wage and the working families tax credit have led to decent incomes; the Tories opposed both measures. Investment in housing and measures introduced in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 could restore the right to decent homes with considerate neighbours, and, under this Government, we are at last starting to achieve a well-resourced police force in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am interested in the love affair in the Committee between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The welcoming gestures from the Under-Secretary as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) spoke relate to the fact that no prospective Labour candidate has yet been adopted for that constituency. Obviously,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
Labour is going to give him a clear run. However, Labour Members expressed venom towards Plaid Cymru Members. One senses that the election campaign is somehow under way already. The jibes directed towards my party were predictable, and I shall not spend too much time dealing with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out, the debate is about more than police numbers and crime. I shall try to deal with those concerns throughout Wales, and to pose some questions for the Under-Secretary. Several issues must be dealt with, especially on crime and policing, whether Labour is re-elected or whether my party forms a Government after the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community action in the form of neighbourhood watch schemes has been mentioned little. Will the Under-Secretary steer us through how he or the Home Office sees such schemes evolving in Wales? It is felt, especially in urban areas, that there should be some greater form of community action to deal with crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is not here, as I am going to quote one of his local county councillors, Mr. Bob Mills. He said in the 	<i>Powys County Times and Express</i> on 14 December that he wanted a fresh approach to policing in Newtown rather than more officers.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the circumstances I believe there to be far too many officers in Newtown and we do not need more on the force. I think we need more on the beat."</p></blockquote>
That is an important point, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again, a programme motion has eaten into debate on an important topic, as one did last week when the Under-Secretary and I were discussing something similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of our concerns on policing in Wales is special constables, who provide an essential back-up, especially in rural areas. On 31 January, the 	<i>Western Mail</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much of Wales is suffering a chronic shortage of special constables … Specials, once referred to as hobby bobbies, are now a much more professional back-up to regular officers and perform much the same duties when on shift. Yet numbers have dropped significantly over the past two years … South Wales Police should have a specials unit of 500 constables but, as of yesterday the official total was only 246, comprising 179 men and 67 women … This compares with January 1999 when the force had 365 specials, and 320 for the same time last year.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Dyfed-Powys Police, covering a huge rural area of Wales and traditionally reliant on a high number of specials, is also down on previous years.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At the end of December 1996 the total was 314. Just over 12 months later the number had dropped to 255 and by December 1999 the force was down to 220 specials.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yesterday a spokesperson said there were now only 196 specials.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In North Wales, operational specials number around 200, a fall of 60 over two years, and well under the force establishment figure of 320 that was met in 1996.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Only in Gwent is the trend different … Howard Hughes, training co-ordinator for specials in South Wales, admitted their situation was desperate and said there was a need for far more publicity about the specials' role, how well they were trained and how much they were contributing to the fight against crime."</p></blockquote>
We believe that the role of the specials can be enhanced, particularly in rural areas, where it would be possible to attach specials to specific villages and communities. The term "parish constable" has been used in the past. The Government should consider the matter, and I will be interested to hear the Under-Secretary's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All police authorities suffer from a pensions problem. Some forces have tried to develop a strategy to encourage officers to stay on after their notional 25 years of service, but a better pensions package for older officers needs to be created. The continued rise in police pensions is eating into revenue budgets. The Association of Police Authorities stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The continued rise in the cost of police pensions is eating further into revenue budgets—we estimate that 14 per cent. of total revenue expenditure in 2000/01 will be spent on pensions. We urgently need an announcement from the Home Secretary on his proposals for dealing with the rising pension bill. We believe the only tenable solution in the long term is a funded pension scheme."</p></blockquote>
Then there is the matter of efficiency. I shall share an interesting statistic with the Committee. The South Wales police website says that 12 minutes spent searching from the air in a helicopter is the equivalent of 400 man hours searching on foot. The air support unit has a vital role in dealing with incidents such as pursuits, recovering stolen vehicles and searching for missing people. I shall translate that comparison into money. An hour of helicopter service costs £2,000; 12 minutes costs £400; an hour's pay at the average rate for one police officer costs £13; and 400 hours therefore costs £5,200. That is a difference of £4,800. Will the Minister give us a clear idea of how those efficiency savings, particularly the use of helicopters, will be funded in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of sick leave. Lat year, the South Wales police force lost about £2.5 million on sick leave. The 	<i>Western Mail</i> of 21 November stated that sickness is expected to remain at similar levels this year. Among civilian support staff, the figure rose to 18.8 sick days last year, compared to the national average of 11.7 days, but it is expected to fall to 15.7 days. Will the Minister give us a clue as to how he is looking at that? Mike Lewis, assistant chief constable for south Wales said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have a problem with sickness. We cannot maintain this level of sickness and maintain our performance in relation to crime detection and reduction".</p></blockquote>
We have heard much about attitudes to violent crime, including from my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans). We know that crime fell in three of the four Welsh police forces last year, but those statistics show that Gwent remains among the most violent areas in England and Wales. The force recorded 25.5 violent crimes per 1,000 people—higher than any other area except inner London. The Minister should be dealing with that when winding up. We shall be looking for answers to some serious matters.

I shall widen the debate slightly; others have already done so, including the Secretary of State in his opening remarks. I want to talk about the relationship between family poverty and crime. I want to put the record straight. A typical working family pays £670 more a year in tax under this Government than under the previous Government. The changes in the taxes imposed on families are a contributory factor. We have seen changes in income tax rates and bands that have made the average family slightly better off, but the abolition of the married couples allowance, the abolition of MIRAS, the tax on pension with the abolition of dividend credits, the above-inflation increase on petrol tax, the increase in tobacco taxes and the above-inflation increases on council tax have all led to a net loss for the average family of £669 during the past three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was intrigued this morning when the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) said that £24 million would be spent in his constituency. I hope that he will break that figure down.

I am conscious of the fact that I said that I would try to be brief. Let us be clear about the simple truth, which is that Labour has failed to deliver on building safer communities. It promised so much, yet has delivered so little, and the evidence is building. We have seen the connections between health and crime.
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
Our hospitals are becoming worse and hospital waiting lists are still up. As our debate has shown, crime is also up, and there are approximately 3,000 fewer police under Labour.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of the debate is building safer communities in Wales, and I am fortunate to represent a constituency in west Wales that is part of the Dyfed Powys police force area. For decades, we have had the lowest incidence of crime in Britain, and the highest detection rate. Dyfed Powys is the safest police area in Britain. Since Labour has been in power, crime has continued to fall. The latest figures from the British crime survey, published last October, show that in Dyfed Powys there was a fall of 4.9 per cent. between September 1999 and September 2000. In total, there has been an 11 per cent. fall in crime since the 1997 general election. Those figures speak for themselves. As I said, we also have the highest detection rate in Britain. An article in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> of 12 January 2001 recorded that the Dyfed Powys force detected 64.2 per cent. of all crime. The England and Wales average is 29 per cent., so the Dyfed Powys rate is double the national average. Not only is there less crime, but the crime that occurs is detected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On finance for the police force, the comprehensive spending review has given us a generous three-year settlement. For this year, the settlement is up 6 per cent. on last year. That includes an extra £1.3 million for rural policing. For several years, our former chief constable, Ray White, argued that police forces in rural areas across Britain were not being sufficiently compensated for the sparsity of the land mass that they had to cover. The Government have recognised that, and Dyfed Powys, of all areas, has done best out of the rural policing formula. In our period of government, the police numbers have risen, from 1,005 in March 1997, to 1,045 on 30 September last year. That is an increase of 40. Thanks to the increased budget, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
will be an extra 79 police recruits over the next three years. Despite the problems, we are substantially increasing police numbers in Dyfed Powys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also delivering on the pledges that we gave at the time of the last general election, one of which was that we would halve the time from arrest to sentencing for persistent young offenders. The national average period in 1997 was 142 days. In Dyfed Powys it was 124 days. That has fallen to 60 days, so that is a pledge achieved. Labour is delivering on all fronts in Dyfed Powys—in terms of law and order, and in terms of building safer communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against this growth in the budget, and growth in the police numbers, the constabulary are aware of the demands being made, especially in rural areas, for a more visible presence. At the united county show in Carmarthen last year, I visited the police tent, and met some people involved in re-opening the police station in St. Clears. In St. Clears, the community wanted a police presence, so it found suitable premises for one. Many volunteers from the community are involved in staffing those premises on a nine-to-five basis, putting in extra hours whenever required. The police call in for few hours every day, so that there is a police presence there, responding to demand in the local community. I understand that roughly 20 such centres are to be opened across Carmarthenshire: St. Clears, Pencader and Llanybydder in the first phase, and later in Pontyates and Llangunnor in my constituency. In a sense, it brings back a village police station presence, which has pulled in more volunteers from the community—people involved in neighbourhood watch, pensioners associations and others who want to be involved in the unpaid but important work of supporting the police in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of my two further points, the first is the proliferation of speed traps. It is important that our driving should be disciplined in built-up areas, but I have noticed, as have others, that now that the police are getting the money from fines, more drivers are being caught. I must plead guilty a small indiscretion; 18 months ago, I was caught driving at 41 mph in a built-up area. It is easy money for the police and I hope that our constabulary—indeed, all police forces—use speed traps only when the traffic layout requires it, in areas where traffic routinely goes too fast or where there are particular hazards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is about car crime. I have generally been lucky; I have never been a victim of crime, but I have suffered from car crime. My car was broken into in London, soon after I was elected to the House, and also at Port Talbot railway station. I routinely drive to Port Talbot, and take the train to London. My car has been stolen four times; twice it was driven away and twice some damage was caused. Those four incidents happened under the Conservative Government between 1987 and 1997. I am pleased to report that, since May 1997, I have not suffered another incident. We in Port Talbot are helping to build safer community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
Finally, I return to the British crime survey and the crime figures for the communities of Wales for the past three and a half years. Crime in Gwent has fallen by 3.1 per cent. In north Wales, it has fallen by 9.1 per cent. In Dyfed Powys, it has fallen by 11 per cent. In south Wales, it has fallen by 24.5 per cent. That gives an average fall of 12 per cent. across Wales since 1997. The Government are certainly sticking to the task; they are in the process of building those safer communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I want to expand a little on the comprehensive and detailed analysis that my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) made at the start of the debate, but I shall concentrate on the supply side of criminal justice—how the court system is working in rural areas. If I have time, I may also "do a little drugs".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a delight to address the Welsh Grand Committee again—it is a baby grand at the moment, but I am sure that other hon. Members will avail themselves of the opportunity to attend later. As those hon. Members who represent constituencies in Dyfed Powys have recently contributed to the debate, I want to put on record my brief thanks to the force in Dyfed Powys for making that area one of the safest in western Europe. Much of that is due to the members of the police force, to the previous chief constable and to the fairly new chief constable, Mr. Dennis Grange. All hon. Members who represent constituencies in that area would want to put it on record that we are personally as well as politically thankful for that. It reflects well on the police force but it also reflects well on the communities that we represent here. It underlines the need for a wider context of protecting those communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to the problems and lack of moral that exists within the lay magistracy. I have met with the magistrates in Aberystwyth and representatives of magistrates throughout the Ceredigion part of Dyfed Powys. They are uncertain about the Government's plans. The Government have sent out uncertain signals. We have heard of the possibility of greater use of stipendiary magistrates—in other words, of salaried local magistrates. I want to emphasise to the Minister how important it is in an area such as Ceredigion, and in rural areas generally, that lay magistrates are seen to dispense local justice. They can take on board the local circumstances. They may even look kindly on the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) when he goes a little too fast along a rural lane, because they realise that in rural areas certain ways of driving must be followed, or one does not get from A to B. The lay magistracy can reflect local needs. It is seen to work effectively. There is a lot of trust in magistrates courts in rural areas. People have an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
association with magistrates. They see their local court as part of their local system of justice; they support it, and want to see it continuing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long-term aim within Dyfed Powys is alarming. Labour Members who represent areas of Dyfed Powys will be aware of this and, I hope, be as alarmed as I am that there is a financial imperative to work towards one court centre per area within Dyfed Powys. That has been set out in black and white in one of the forward plans for the magistrates courts. It has not yet been enacted, but as a result of the closure of Lampeter magistrates court, there has been a threat to some of the Narey cases, which were working well in Cardigan. That threat has been lifted, but in west Wales we are questioning just how court justice will be delivered in a rural area in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can provide an example of how a magistrates court closure can affect constituents. A constituent of the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr who needed to attend court in my constituency had to walk from his home to the court. He left home in Talley in Talyllychau at 5 am, to try hitch a lift in to his court case in Aberystwyth. He arrived at 4.30 pm, after the warrant for his arrest had been issued because he had not turned up for court. The magistrates took pity on him, but such incidents show that local justice is not being delivered locally. We must reappraise the need for strategic courts such as Lampeter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an Adjournment debate recently and the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department replied to it. He claimed—I want to put this on the record because I have proof positive from the magistrates courts committee—that there had been a 6.54 per cent. increase in magistrates courts funding for Dyfed Powys. I have the letter from the magistrates courts here, and it tells me that 6.54 per cent. is in reality 3.46 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to deliver justice locally, we need to think about the cost of it, and consider how it might be achieved. An uplift of 3 per cent. is making it very difficult to deliver justice in rural areas and meet the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998. That is the killer. We need to bring old court houses up to the required standards, and I do not deny that that is a problem. The Government are saying that the local magistrates courts committee makes the decisions, but the Government give 80 per cent. of the funding, so a lot of thought needs to go into that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response to the recent Police Foundation report on drugs was late in coming; it came a year after the Runciman report. I would like to express a different view on the way in which the Government have responded to the report, and the way forward for Wales and the UK on this issue. Before I do so, I want to make it clear that my party consistently supports the need for a royal commission on drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that we have run up against a difficulty, particularly with cannabis. There is little evidence to show that the increase in drugs is being thwarted or met by the present use of resources. In other words, the deterrent effect that we have gone for in the UK does not seem to be working. Possession offences are
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
dominating most of the time that the criminal justice system is taking up to deal with drugs. I argue that we need to free up that time to deal with the more substantial matters of drug dealing and drugs that have a more injurious effect on communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to tell the Committee that his party is now in favour of legalising drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not listen to what I said. I said that this was my personal view. If we cannot have an open debate on an issue that is affecting hundreds of people and thousands of young people, then we really should not be here at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just because there is a general election on the horizon, we do not need to be trading party political points about something that needs cross-party work. If the hon. Gentleman is only going deliberately to misinterpret everything that I say in order to return, in a totally unsatisfactory way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I cannot accept any interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the public attitude towards drugs— the hon. Gentleman may not be of the generation that has this attitude towards drugs—is related directly to the perceived health-related dangers of particular drugs; it is not related to the illegality or otherwise of those drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the question. The hon. Gentleman may have been sleeping when I made that statement. The Police Foundation report made it clear that the experience in other countries— not so much the Netherlands where drugs are not legalised as decriminalised, but particularly in the German Lander—is something that we should be looking at within the UK. In that context, I think that the Government's response so far has been somewhat disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final issue is the use of antisocial behaviour orders—a matter on which I intervened in the speech of the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). On 7 February, I had an answer to a written question, which revealed that, to date, there have been just two antisocial behaviour orders in Wales; one in north Wales and one in south Wales. As I said in my intervention, I can think of two areas where certainly the communities and the police are seriously thinking about this now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the problem is—other hon. Members have mentioned costs—but we really need to work through this problem because the antisocial behaviour orders have a real role to play in the criminal justice system, in rural areas and on the council estates that I represent. I can think of many areas where they would have a huge effect. Whatever is holding us back, I say to the Minister: Can we please, please move to get them working better between local authorities and the police constabulary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we would all agree that building safer communities in Wales has to be a close partnership between all agencies, including the public. A crucial element, however, is the police. A dedicated police force with high morale and self-respect is the lynchpin of any successful policy for a safer community. So, for a few moments, I shall share with the Committee recent developments in north Wales, which I believe will greatly contribute to that goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that this is the only scheme in Wales and could be the first of its kind in the UK. A week ago, a long-term partnership was launched between north Wales police and the employment service—a powerful partnership, in my view. They will be working together on a number of projects. They began a new campaign supporting the national police campaign to recruit more officers to the service. The Employment Service is the largest recruitment agency in Wales. It has a network of 25 offices in north Wales. Access to its services has recently improved through the introduction of a website. Later this year, it will introduce job points to allow job seekers to use touch screen technology instantly to access vacancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That advanced and powerful service is to be used to build on the already successful recruitment of new police officers to the North Wales police. Since 1 April 2000, 92 officers have been recruited in north Wales following Home Office funding allocations. Those officers will be on probation for two years, starting with 35 weeks intensive training. During that time, they will visit one of the national police training schools in England and Wales, and will also be training in one of the local police divisional training units at Bangor, Rhyl and Wrexham. Following the initial 35 weeks, the officers will progress their training by carrying out duties in different parts of north Wales. They will also be involved in further training into a different aspect of police work, for example CID or traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That partnership has been cemented at the highest level in north Wales by our new chief constable, Richard Brunstrom, and the Employment Service Wales director, Sheelagh Keyse. That is how we in north Wales intend to strengthen our police force, by taking a positive attitude. We shall then be able to build on the foundations that we have laid since coming into office in May 1997 for the most determined attack on crime in a generation. The police, local councils and others throughout north Wales are already working together successfully. In north Wales, recorded crime has fallen by 11.4 per cent. and domestic burglary has fallen by 28.3 percent. since the election. My constituency of Conwy has additional funding for anti-burglary projects and for CCTV schemes. I was born in the constituency that I now represent. I have been particularly pleased to see Ministers taking an interest in areas that have been neglected for longer than the lifetime of many youths in my constituency. The Maesgeirchen area of Bangor was visited last year by the Select Committee on Welsh Affair. It had been ignored by Westminster until this
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
Government took office. Since then, the former Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and the First Minister for the National Assembly for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) have had discussions with local residents and bodies representing them, such as the healthy living centre steering group, the tenants and residents association at Maesgeirchen and police representatives. There is now a new policing initiative for that area, something that was badly lacking. I pay tribute to the tenants and residents of Maesgeirchen and look forward to further fruitful discussions with Ministers, so that my constituency will never again be forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are funding an extra 104 police recruits for north Wales over the next three years, over and above the chief constable's existing plans. The Government are well on the way to delivering a key election pledge, which is to half the time from arrest to sentencing for persistent young offenders. By June 2000, the north Wales figure had fallen to 65 days, from 124 days in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Secretary of State for his endeavours on behalf of the people of Wales, and ask him to pass our thanks to the Home Secretary and his Ministers for listening to our requests, and for providing the welcome generous additional resources that will enable our police forces in Wales to protect our communities in the correct manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening speech, the Secretary of State talked about the wide issues that affect, and make safe, communities. The issues of jobs, benefits, child care and transport all affect public safety and have been well covered in the debate. The Government have made huge strides with the minimum wage and record increases in child benefit and child care strategy. All those measures help to make safer communities. However, crime and safety and the fear of crime is one of the big issues that people discuss when they come to our surgeries, and it is among the most important issues that we deal with. Much of today's debate has concentrated on how much of an improvement there has been, and whether or not there has been an improvement, but the general consensus is that crime is falling and police numbers are rising. The public want to see bobbies on the beat, and we are making progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some areas, it is particularly important that the greatest progress has been made on domestic burglary. I have been burgled many times, as I am sure many members of this Committee have, and it is a very upsetting experience. The decrease in domestic burglaries by 28 per cent. since the election is a huge stride forward. Vehicle theft has also gone down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much progress has been made. In my police area in south Wales, recorded crime has declined by 24.5 per cent. since the election, which is a huge drop. That is good news, but there is still a long way to go. It is important to recognise not only that progress has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
made, but that we have a long way to go. Hon. Members have expressed concern that violent crime continues to rise, and it is important that we get to grips with the problem of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, I pay tribute to Cardiff violence prevention group and to Professor Shepherd, who has been very successful in working with agencies in partnerships to try to reduce violent crime. Some of the methods used are very simple, such as putting a free phone in accident and emergency departments so that the police can be contacted, because there is a huge problem of under-reporting of violent crime. Other measures could be used to encourage more people to report crime, because only 25 per cent. of violent crimes causing the victim to have medical treatment are recorded, and only 10 per cent. of assaults in pubs and clubs are recorded. We know that 30 per cent. of people who suffer such injuries develop severe psychological problems, and the trauma of experiencing an attack cannot be underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt huge sympathy for the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) when I heard what he went through when he was attacked. We have to remember the victims, and the crime prevention group has worked with the victims. We should concentrate on that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another useful measure is to educate and train doormen in clubs, because some of the violence in city centres is due to their lack of training. The use of toughened glass is also important. I am pleased that some of the hon. Members present have signed early-day motion 245, which calls for bottles to be made of toughened glass. People often drink directly from bottles, and using toughened glass would reduce injuries enormously. I hope other Members will consider signing that early-day motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Domestic violence is an extremely important issue that has not been mentioned in the debate. It is a serious problem for the whole family, but especially for the children who experience domestic violence first hand. It is estimated that one in four women suffer domestic violence. It is a crime that is also massively under-reported. On those figures, more than 20,000 women in Cardiff may experience domestic violence, but less than 2,000 incidents have been reported. We must do something about this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to declare an interest as the chair of the Cardiff domestic violence forum. When women experiencing domestic violence seek help, they often have to go to0020about 10 places. We have put a bid in to the Home Office for a women's safety unit. Will the Minister pursue that on our behalf, as well as any other bids from Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of whether more people should be sent to prison and the debate that we are having with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, I agree that persistent offenders make life miserable for their neighbours and cause problems for decent law-abiding citizens, but I believe that maximum use should be made of community sentences, and I support the Government's moves in that direction. I support the tracking system, which has been overwhelmingly
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
successful. However long sentences are, prisoners ultimately have to leave prison, and the more that can be done to help them in that process the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel particularly strongly about women in prison. The number of women in prison has risen disproportionately, but most women have committed offences that do not make them a risk to the community. Their imprisonment causes enormous problems to their families and children. Women have to leave Wales to go to prisons in England, causing additional problems for their families, but I do not support the proposal of building a women's prison in Wales. Our aim should be to reduce the number of women in prison, and I believe that building a women's prison in Wales would be counterproductive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made great strides, but there is a huge amount still to do. I am confident that we will tackle the issues, particularly violence crime, violence against women and women in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to speak about building safer communities, because I have a good story to tell. According to the most recent statistics, my constituency is the safest community in south Wales and one of the safest in the country. People are less likely to be attacked there than anywhere else. We should be proud of that. In the mid-1990s, there were a total of 15,000 recorded crimes in the Vale of Glamorgan. We are waiting for the Vale of Glamorgan division to publish its latest statistics, which will show a dramatic reduction of 33 percent. to a total of 10,000 recorded crimes. That would have been a good story in itself but there is more: the real story is that 10 years ago, E division, the old Vale of Glamorgan division, had one of the worst crime rates and one of the highest incidences of violent crime in Barry. We have therefore seen a dramatic turnaround of that situation over the past five to 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would love to be able to say, "Well done" just to the Labour Government—if it had not been for the Labour Government, we would not have seen those dramatic changes—but there are several other important reasons for that improvement. We have talked about the causes of crime. There is no doubt that the major causes of crime in my constituency are poverty and deprivation. Between 1979 and 1982, there was an 80 per cent. loss in manufacturing jobs— the most sought after and best paid jobs in Barry and the Vale of Glamorgan—so it was little wonder that eight years later we had one of the highest crime rates. There was a direct correlation between that loss of jobs and those crime rates. The first question any good copper asks—or used to ask—a suspect is, "Have you got a job?" The second is, "Where do you live?" If the police associate a suspect with a certain area, it is almost invariably associated with social deprivation. Police officers know the causes of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not excusing crime, but explaining it. To quote a statistic that I have quoted before—I repeat it because hon. Members may simply not believe it—in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
north-east Barry in the mid-1990s, according to the most recent comprehensive housing needs survey, the gross domestic income in a household including all non-housing benefit was less than £60 a week. That family income had to provide food, clothing and support a way of life. Do not tell me that there is no direct relationship between people having to live on such a low income and the sudden, dramatic increase in crime, especially among young people—that is where unemployment, especially youth unemployment, contributed massively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years, there has been a dramatic improvement in all those indices. In my constituency, unemployment is no longer a problem. We have other problems. We do not have the right kind of employment or employment that pays enough, but unemployment as such is back down to the level it was more than 25 years ago when that great economist John Maynard Keynes referred to "frictional" unemployment: an unemployment level caused by people simply changing jobs. That has had a dramatic effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working families tax credit and the minimum wage have improved the situation dramatically, and there has been a reduction in crime, but there is more to it than that. We are changing the way in which we police our communities. That has had a dramatic effect in my constituency over the past few years in particular. Ten years ago, as many as one in three of my constituents would raise with me an issue not necessarily about a crime, but about the fear of crime. Now, as my hon. Friends have rightly said, crime is still a major problem among constituents, but nothing like it was before: it is now down to perhaps one in eight or one in 10. One of the problems is people's perception of crime, especially the elderly and young women, who are afraid to go out at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership approach has made the difference, as efforts in the Vale of Glamorgan over the past few years show. There has been partnership with our schools. Police officers, such as PC Bill Fletcher, have gone into our schools as part of the anti-racist and anti-bullying campaigns. He has tried to tackle the problem at the root cause, that has had an effect over the years. We have the largest number of neighbourhood watch groups in the whole of Wales, so it is no coincidence that we have seen a dramatic improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the role of the good copper, and to the good leadership in the local police force. I believe that the dramatic change in my area in the past couple of years is partly due to Police Superintendent Colin Jones, and I pay tribute to him. Some people may not accept that, and I hear a few sniggers in the Committee Room, but he has made a big difference to policing in our area. He lives in the community, which makes a huge difference because he knows and lives in the area he polices. His officers are allocated to the known communities throughout the constituencies—the wards. He knows the local business and elected leaders, so he picks up where the problems are very
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
early on. A higher proportion of his recruited officers live in the community, so they have a vested interest in ensuring that crime is brought down. They get married in that community, they bring their children up in that community and they do not want to live in a community that is dominated by crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have known about the professionalism of our police for a long time, but it is the style of leadership that is important. It is a great honour for me to pay tribute to Superintendent Colin Jones. I can tell the Committee openly that I have a vested interest in doing so, because I know that he is coming up to retirement age. He will shortly have to decide whether to continue policing our community or to retire. I do not want to lose him or the magnificent team we have in the Vale of Glamorgan, because they have done such a good job over the last four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend, who paid tribute to one of the outstanding police officers in the area. I am sure that all members of the Committee can identify police officers and others in the police force who have made a significant contribution to reducing crime in their area. It gave me great pleasure just a few months ago to meet the chief constable of Gwent, Mr. Keith Turner, who had formerly been at Dyfed Powys police force, and to give him a copy of a letter from the Prime Minister congratulating Gwent police on its 10 per cent. reduction in crime in the earlier part of this financial year. That improvement has continued. Gwent, none the less, remains a comparatively high crime area. It has the smallest police force in Wales, which has the second highest detection rates of all the police forces in England and Wales. That has been an historic achievement, and the Committee should pay tribute to Gwent for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The high crime rate remains. I am disappointed that the increase to be allocated for Gwent in the police funding formula for the distribution of new resources to the police forces of England and Wales is below the national average. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I met the chief constable of Gwent a couple of weeks ago, we discussed some of the problems of policing in Gwent. The part of Gwent that I represent, B division, is a largely rural area where there is a problem of sparsity. There are police stations in Chepstow, Abergavenny and Monmouth. There is a beautiful little police station in Usk. It must be one of the prettiest police stations in the entire country or indeed the world, especially during the Usk in bloom festival. I urge hon. Friends to come to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a concern among my constituents. I happen to live next to Monmouth police station. Visitors turn up to the police station at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening and find it closed and have to make a phone call to Pontypool. People expect police stations to be staffed most of the time, just as they expect ambulance stations to be staffed and to have ambulances most of the time. Until recently, they did not have that in Monmouth. Through good representations we have now changed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
There is a particular problem in rural areas because of the sparsity and the distances that have to be travelled. The farming community has been concerned about crime on isolated farms, such as the stealing of fanning equipment and plants. People living in isolated areas do not have the same access to neighbours as other victims of crime. I had a fruitful meeting about that with members of the National Farmers Union Wales. To its credit, Gwent police force has now designated additional police officers to serve the rural areas, following a good model that has been developed in Gloucestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gwent police area is also characterised by high levels of social deprivation, as shown by the fact that much of Gwent is in an objective 1 area. Hon. Members who represent Gwent, such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), recognise the problems of social deprivation in the area. We honestly believe that the police funding formula, which is supposed to have some element of weighting, is not adequately weighted for social deprivation. That was a matter that the chief constable was keen to impress upon us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the comments of other hon. Members about the use of antisocial behaviour orders. I have made representations following one or two incidents involving antisocial behaviour, and I have been disappointed by how slowly they have been considered. It may have been right not to instigate antisocial behaviour orders, but my impression was that the agencies were slow to respond. Housing associations on estates do not have the same powers as local authorities to instigate antisocial behaviour orders. I know that these problems are difficult to deal with, but my impression was that they could have been considered more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday in the House, in the debate on prison conditions, I spoke about Usk prison, which is a model of a progressive prison. It has a very high commitment to inmate training, behaviour modification programmes, sex offender treatment programmes, training and education. It was a great pleasure for me to visit Usk prison recently and see some of the developments that have occurred there. Three years ago, there were two or three people working in the sex offender treatment programme, and now there are 11, including probation officers, specially trained prison officers and psychologists. They are making a great difference. There has been a 46 per cent. non-reoffending rate among people who have been through the sex offender treatment programme, which is available only to prisoners in their last year of sentence. It is important that such prisoners do not reoffend when they come out of prison and back into society, as they inevitably will. A 46 per cent. rate is good, but 100 per cent. would be the ideal, and that is what we are working towards. I am delighted to commend the work of Usk Prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should emphasise strongly the importance of a building safer communities in Wales, and this debate is an opportunity to do that. The Government were determined to begin by developing a strong economy and within that economy to tackle unemployment, to ensure there were more jobs. We know that that has been done in Wales, despite the bad news about Corus—let us hope that we get some good news before the end of the week. Despite that bad news, 40,000 more people work in Wales now than in 1997. Moreover, despite the loss of jobs in manufacturing, extra jobs have been created. In 1999–2000, which is the last year for which we have figures, the average full-time wage rose faster in Wales than in Great Britain as a whole. It rose by 4.1 per cent. in Wales compared with 2.6 per cent. in Great Britain as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working families tax credit helps about 70,000 families, and the national minimum wage benefits about 10 per cent. of the Welsh work force. There has been a 70 per cent. increase in income support for under 11s since April 1998, the child care tax credit assists almost 6,000 families and there have been significant increases in child benefit. All these schemes give people more money in their pockets to help them to live better without the need that many have felt to become involved in crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our strong economy has also meant that the Government have been able to invest in public services, and have put more money into education and training. This year, local government had a record increase—despite the whinging of the Conservatives, it has had the best deal. Huge complications arise from the changes in the local government formula, but there is more money for local government and the police, with more people working in the police force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recorded crime has gone down, not just because of extra resources, but because of more thoughtful policing. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) has already mentioned what has happened in his area—I have family connections, but I will not go into that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In Bridgend, focused policing in the problem areas has helped to bring crime down. There is a communities-that-care programme involving local government, the police, social services, education, and voluntary organisations, such as Kenfig Hill Pyle Connelly, which last year won the Philip Lawrence citizenship award for the work of young people led by a young mother, Helena Parobijc. They are doing fantastic work in helping to get young people off the streets. There are four projects in the Bridgend county borough area. Such initiatives, backed by Government finance, help to build safer communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an excellent debate. What strikes me is that everyone cares about solving crime and crime prevention. It is a shame that no Home Office Ministers are present. I understand the stresses and strains of their job, as they are very much in the front line. They are dealing with six Bills at the moment, so they must be overloaded, like some of our police forces. None the less, their presence would have been helpful, as their Department controls the purse strings and has responsibility for these matters, together with the Lord Chancellor. The Secretary of State's wide-ranging speech helpfully included specific references to social exclusion. As many hon. Members have pointed out, there is no doubt that employment and wage levels are important in stabilising society, lowering crime and making society safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a discussion about the new deal and the national minimum wage. I believe that the new deal should be available to 16-year-olds, particularly to 16 to 18-year-olds. Unless we solve these problems, there will be more criminal elements. I hope that that will not happen, and that problems such as those in the steel industry will be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question mark over police numbers. The Government have made a commitment to raise police numbers and have set targets. However, there is a large wastage rate as police officers leave the service. Crime and disorder partnerships are important, and rural crime is of particular concern to me and my community, as I represent a rural constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) rightly concentrated on increases in violent crime. Violent crime in rural areas in particular is a problem, which we ignore at our peril. I believe that the problem is alcohol-related, as violent crime peaks on Friday and Saturday evenings. We have all experienced that, and it needs to be tackled head on. The hon. Gentleman highlighted the funding problems, which have been fully debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rt. hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) mentioned on-the-spot fines. I am sure that that has resulted in a vast improvement. He mentioned in particular the reduction of violent crime and the laudable methods deployed in Cardiff. The rt. hon. Gentleman is a former Home Office Minister, who has taken a great interest in these matters and has contributed much to solving the problem of crime. We all appreciate that.

The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) dealt with the important issues of drugs, notifiable offences and early releases. I, too, am sorry for the rough experience that he had with criminals on his property. We want to banish that sort of behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of Clywd (Mr. Ruane) rightly concentrated on tackling the underlying problem of poverty, and similar matters. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) rightly praised Dyfed Powys police force, whose record is outstanding. The detection rate, at 64.2 per cent., is the best in the land. I should like to
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
pay tribute to the former head of the police service, Chief Constable Ray White, who was an outstanding police officer and did a fantastic job in Dyfed Powys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) quite rightly concentrated on the problems of keeping courts open—a matter that is occupying us a great deal in Powys. There is very little understanding in the Lord Chancellor's Department of the distances involved in rural Wales. My constituency is 87 miles long and 47 miles wide, yet they are trying to have a situation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about magistrates courts. We understand that there are plans to close Ystradgynlais and Llandrindod magistrates courts in Powys. That is totally unacceptable and we are making representations to the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) rightly discussed violent crime and in particular how women are affected by domestic violence. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) talked about a 33 per cent. reduction in crime, and the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) talked about how unemployment affects crime. They both talked about a man whom I suppose should be called super Col, Colin Jones, who appears to be an excellent policeman. I am sure that there are excellent policemen in all our areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) rightly mentioned the problems of rural crime and the means of tackling them. My hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) discussed the importance of jobs and health and the dangers of crime. He espoused the virtue of Robert Owen—which I do, too—whose vision still applies today. The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mrs. Lawrence) talked in particular about council estates and their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) was right to discuss community action and neighbourhood watch, but perhaps not right to extol the virtues of Councillor Bob Mills, who was done for grievous bodily harm four years ago and who has flirted with some political parties, but not the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To develop that theme, I suggest that the reason why Bob Mills thought that there were too many policemen in Newtown was because he got nicked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that was the motivating factor for his statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way to create freedom from crime is to provide sufficient police to improve the prevention and detection of crime. Liberal Democrats plan to increase overall police numbers by 6,000 and the number in Wales by at least 500. We want to make crime and disorder partnerships focus on improvements for local

residents. We want to cut re-offending, give victims and their families greater rights to be heard in court, and target the causes of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime prevention is excellent in many parts of Wales. I am old enough to remember when the people in the crowd at Cardiff Arms park sang off by heart "The Bold Gendarmes" and "We'll run them in" when the other side was playing dirty. The culture that encourages people to behave in their societies still exists in Wales. The problem is that violence is up, which we must tackle head on.We must aim at social factors such as full employment, because they are bound to reduce crime. There is no question but that we need more bobbies on the beat. The speeches about keeping police stations open are especially important. We must all work together in partnership with youth, communities, the churches and councils to support the police and to make our communities safer places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The probation service in Powys has been destroyed by its proposed amalgamation with that of Dyfed. Powys probation service had the best record in the United Kingdom and received many awards. We regret that it is being amalgamated because a huge area has to be covered. The role of the probation service in small communities is absolutely vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are all issues that we need to deal with. I believe that we are going in the right direction. There is a will among politicians of all parties to achieve that. We need more funding and more people. If we go along that route, and as long as we have enough magistrates courts in the locality to deal with the problems in our society, we will make considerable progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate in the time that we have had. We have heard not just useful contributions, but useful confessions. Several hon. Members have come clean and declared previous form, as I think the phrase goes in the police service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rightly, we have concentrated on crime. That was the Govt's purpose in bringing forward the motion. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, the Government are concerned not just with tackling crime, but with looking at the underlying causes of crime. We have had many welcome contributions today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I explain the absence of the Secretary of State? We have overrun and he is in an important ministerial meeting about another matter. I hope that you, Mr. Jones, and the Committee will understand his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are focusing on crime. We have heard a number of important speeches. I particularly welcome the contribution by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). As well as his experience in Wales, both as Secretary of State and as First Minister, he brings to the debate his experience as a Home Office Minister. He and my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mrs. Lawrence), for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane), for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams), for Conwy
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
(Mrs. Williams), for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan), for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr Smith), for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) and for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) have all mentioned the fact that, under the proposals that the Government have introduced, we have seen an increase in the number of police on the beat in Wales since the general election. As a result of increased funding, there have been 146 extra officers in Wales since the election. Funding for tackling crime has increased by 15.6 per cent since 1997. It is a record settlement, which will give police budgets their biggest boost since the early 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, Welsh police forces will receive nearly £390 million from the main settlement for 2001–02. All of my hon. Friends have mentioned the impact of that resource on the ground-floor operations of the police. There are increases of £56.3 million for the Dyfed Powys police, £75.1 million for Gwent, £82.2 million for North Wales and a massive £176.1 million for the South Wales force—all real increases in funding thanks to the Government. My hon. Friends have recognised that contribution and made much of it in their speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcome the local examples given by several hon. Members about how that money is being used on the ground, in partnership with the Assembly, local authorities, voluntary agencies and with the victims of crime, to ensure that we tackle the problems. All my hon. Friends have mentioned that partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those forces will also receive £8.5 million for Airwave. Dyfed Powys, Gwent and North Wales will receive an additional £4.3 million for rural policing and there will be approximately £5.7 million from the crime fighting fund if forces meet the criteria. Overall, police funding in Wales has risen by £53.7 million, a 15.6 per cent. increase since 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) said that police numbers had fallen. If he has any alternative figures, I would be grateful if he wrote to me and brought them to my attention, but, in March 1997, in Wales, there were 6,592 police officers. In September 2000—these are the latest figures that we have—there were 6,738 officers, an extra 146 police officers on the ground in Wales since the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the detail on the full-time officers. Does the Minister deny, however, that the number of special constables in Wales has gone down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was looking forward to the issue of special constables being raised because those figures relate to real police officers, on the beat, doing real jobs trying to prevent crime. I recognise that the number of special constables occasionally causes difficulty. There are issues there, which the hon. Gentleman has drawn to the attention of the Committee. I recognise those concerns. The Government believe that special constables have a valuable contribution to make. Indeed, the Home Office is undertaking a new recruitment drive in England and Wales. All four Welsh forces are actively involved in recruiting special constables. Again, the Government are very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
supportive of neighbourhood watch. Neighbourhood-watch schemes are extremely strong in Wales. They are supported by the police, are growing and are valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Real issues were raised by hon. Members. The hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and for Ribble Valley mentioned violent crime. I accept that that is an important issue. Only last week in my constituency, I visited the victim of an armed post office raid. I saw at first hand, shortly after the raid, the circumstances that the individual faced and the fear that that brought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an issue that the Government are trying to tackle. Last year, about 38 per cent. of notifiable offences in Wales involved either violence against a person or criminal damage. However, the post office incident in my constituency is not the norm. Most violent crimes in Wales—the police agree—arise in public order situations such as drunken balls outside pubs. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I mean drunken brawls, although it is possibly balls as well—who knows? There are some strange events of an evening in many parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important thing to mention is that disorderly and anti-social behaviour is exactly the type of crime which the Government are targeting in the new Criminal Justice and Police Bill—exactly the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made in his excellent contribution. The link between alcohol misuse and crime and disorder is widely accepted. The Bill would allow local authorities to ban drinking in designated places and give police new powers of arrest to enforce those bans. I believe that that is welcome. Indeed, many hon. Members have mentioned that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned the difficulties that have been raised about Gwent police funding. I know that the Secretary of State is concerned—he is a Gwent Member—but I refer the hon. Gentleman, to counterbalance some of his points, to a letter dated 29 November 2000 to my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), the Whip on duty today, from Mr. Keith Turner, the chief constable. He said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have some good news for you. So far, we have been awarded 31 additional police officers from the Crime Fighting Fund…There is more good news in the pipeline … In the 2002–03 … we are expecting an allocation of an additional 32 officers from this fund."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that, at the end of the three-year period in Gwent:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will have been awarded an additional 81 police officers … Moreover, these officers are over and above those we would acquire through our normal recruiting process. Good news indeed".</p></blockquote>
There are difficulties, but I concur that efforts are being made by the Government to secure those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is very limited. I take on board the points that the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Simon Thomas) made, which were supported by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey), about rural court services. I have no direct responsibility for those matters. I will examine them and report back to the hon. Member for Ceredigion about the conversations that I will have with the appropriate officer about those issues in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final points that I want to make relate to the issue of preventing crime. Extra policing, partnership and the issues that all hon. Members have raised in the debate are important, but it is vital to tackle the causes of crime, too. It is not just a slogan; it is an issue. The working families tax credit, the minimum wage, the developments in the Employment Service and the increase in jobs in our community are all important issues. It is right to say that those are things that the Government have done and brought to the table, which will add to the sum total of employment and, therefore, the safety of communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on this overtly political point. I repeat that the Conservative party's cuts would not have supported those initiatives. It did not support them in the House of Commons. It is all very well for Conservative Members to say that they support the minimum wage, but I do not recall them voting for it. The Government are committed to those social improvements, to police funding and to tackling the causes of crime and crime itself. I believe that we have a great story to tell to the communities of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
