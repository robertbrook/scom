	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Ms. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with chief constables in Wales concerning the Government's funding of police forces in Wales. [148987]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet all four Welsh chief constables on a regular basis. I last met them on 15 January to discuss a number of issues affecting policing in Wales, including the funding of police forces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Dyfed-Powys police force, which covers my area, is responsible for policing over half the landmass of Wales. The police in my area are especially pleased with the money that the Government have provided for rural policing. Does my right hon. Friend, like me, welcome the fact that this money will enable the Dyfed-Powys force to consider reopening police stations in rural areas that were closed during the years of Tory Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I welcome that. Welsh police forces are to receive nearly £390 million from the main settlement for the next financial year. Of that, £56.3 million is going to Dyfed-Powys. I endorse what my hon. Friend has said particularly because, of course, crime is not restricted to industrial or urban areas. The money that is allocated to my hon. Friend's constituency and others is very welcome indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>2. 	<div class='member'> Mr. Martin Caton	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has held with the First Secretary about manufacturing industry in Wales. [148988]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regularly meet the First Minister and discuss a wide range of issues including manufacturing in Wales. I welcome the announcement that Ford is investing £240 million at its Bridgend plant, creating over 600 new jobs. That is a major coup for Welsh industry and a welcome sign that manufacturing investment is back on track after what has been an extremely difficult month for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the good news. My right hon. Friend may have had an opportunity to discuss these matters at the Millennium stadium a week last Saturday, at the rugby international. Did he have the chance to glance at the roof of the stadium—perhaps to avert his eyes from what was happening on the pitch? If so, he would have seen the first-class product of Welsh steel workers. Many of those panels were made or finished at the Bryngwyn works in Gorseinon in my constituency. Does my right hon. Friend realise how sickened some of the families in Gorseinon were to see Corus management drinking and laughing in their hospitality box at that match, just days after they had announced the decimation of the Welsh steel industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's frustration. All of us who represent constituencies in Wales that will be affected by the closures—and there are few in south Wales or in the north-east of the country that will not be affected—will share his views. I was at the rugby match. It was a sad day for Wales but, in that regard, I am sure that things will get better as the weeks progress. I fully understand his points about Gorseinon. Steel is an important industry for his constituency and for that town. All of us who represent Welsh steel-working communities are fearful of the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Things may get better for the rugby, but can the Secretary of State put his hand on his heart and assure us that that is the case in manufacturing? Since 1990, there has been a net loss of 38,000 manufacturing jobs in Wales—in fact we are losing 10 for every new one that is announced— affecting works in every part of Wales. What specific steps will he take to reverse that situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency in which the vast bulk of people who work, work in manufacturing. I, too, am concerned about the job losses that we have seen in manufacturing, as well as in steel and other industries, in Wales. However, the many jobs that are coming into Wales balance those losses. I have already referred to the jobs at Bridgend, and communications firms will be bringing several hundred jobs to my constituency during the next couple of weeks. Lost jobs are being replaced by other jobs. That is the essence of the matter. In a fast-moving economy, we must be diverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing output has risen by 1.6 per cent, during the past year, and productivity has risen by 4 per cent. The problems in the steel industry concern all of us in Wales. What Corus has done has been a dreadful blow, but it must not hide the good news about the manufacturing and investment coming into our Welsh constituencies because of the Government's sound economic management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As manufacturing industry modernises, the survival of fit and healthy companies often means job losses. Ford's announcement last week reversed that trend. In the past, it has cut jobs to stay alive, but it has now
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
announced new jobs because of the success of the Bridgend plant, brought about by all its staff—men and management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes in Corus are due to short-term financial issues, not new technology, given that it has offloaded hundreds of millions of pounds on to its shareholders. Can my right hon. Friend tell me whether Corus has had discussions with Ford about how it can overcome short-term problems, such as with exchange rates, and still be prepared to invest in Welsh manufacturing for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, who is in a good position to comment because many hundreds, if not thousands, of his Bridgend constituents work in the steel industry. Ford has now provided 600 extra jobs in his constituency. Wireless Systems International has brought over 260 new jobs to my constituency. Such companies are taking long-term decisions about their futures. Our fear, expressed in our comments in the past few days, is that Corus has not taken a long-term decision, but has thought of only the short term. What is the sense of closing down whole works, or parts of works, on the basis of an exchange rate that may change, and is even changing at the moment? The trade unions are meeting Corus tomorrow, and we appeal to it to reconsider the proposals and think about the long term—not just for the future of the company, but for the future of our communities in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference has been made to the rugby international. I would not dream of entering a hospitality box, especially with Corus directors. During that game, I sat next to a steel worker who had been made redundant, and had an interesting discussion with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been tremendous job losses in both manufacturing and farming. In my constituency, over 1,000 Lucas Rists workers have lost their jobs, as have 150 workers in motorway remoulds in Knighton. Has the Secretary of State made representations to his colleagues in the Treasury about the euro and the exchange rate, which lose us money on every tonne of steel, every gallon or litre of milk, and every kilo of lamb and beef? Has he read in this morning's papers that Welsh farming has lost £2.6 million of its income during the past 12 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman was not addressing the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Agriculture is important, but does not relate to a question on manufacturing—although I understand the hon. Gentleman's points about job losses. I want to re-emphasise my point that the Government must be concerned with balancing job losses and job gains. In my constituency, between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs have been lost over the past decade, but they have all been replaced. The Government must concentrate their attention on ensuring that any jobs lost are replaced by those in other sectors. The Government do not underestimate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the enormity of the proposals that Corus is putting to the people of Wales, or their consequences. That is why we are urging Corus to reconsider its decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my right hon. Friend noted the anger and disbelief, expressed by Dutch Corus workers, at the abominable way in which the Welsh and English workers have been treated? On the continent of Europe it is usual for companies to work in partnership with workers in an atmosphere of mutual respect. Is it not true that Corus, therefore, stands out as an ugly exception to that rule? If we are successfully to apply pressure to a transnational company, should not that be applied transnationally by unions and Governments? In addition to meeting the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly, will my right hon. Friend seek talks with his opposite numbers in Germany and Holland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will consider anything that ensures that Corus changes its mind. However, when the chief executive of Corus, Sir Brian Moffat, met me, the First Minister for Wales, the Prime Minister and a Trade and Industry Minister in past weeks, he was always confident that his proposals would go through unaltered. He took no notice of the point that the Government could help the steel industry because he was determined to take the route that he did. When Sir Brian Moffat meets the trade unions and they suggest positive, detailed alternatives to his announcement, I hope that he will consider them seriously. The issue concerns the long-term future of the steel industry in the United Kingdom and Wales. Once the steelworks has been closed, it cannot be reopened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend regularly meets the First Secretary and discusses a wide range of industry matters. My right hon. Friend visited Avimo Optical Imaging, Prestatyn in September and visited Thales Optronics, Llandudno Junction—formerly Pilkington Optronics—last week. I have also met the Optro-Electronic Forum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply and pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State who last Thursday met the members of the Welsh Optro-Electronic Forum and a senior Thales representative, Benwar Bazir. The Welsh Optro-Electronic Forum is key to the regeneration of central north Wales. They intend to put forward a £10 million objective 1 project that will have incubation and research facilities. I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends for their full political support for such projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches on an important issue. I know that he champions the optoelectronic industry in his constituency and the rest of Wales. I welcome the announcement of £210,000 for

the objective 1 programme, which the Government secured for Wales—let us not forget that. That money is allocated to establishing a sector champion for this key industry. I wish the Welsh Optro-Electronic Forum well in its bid for objective 1 funding. As has been said, the manufacturing industry is important. Equally, industries, such as that of opto-electronics, are key future sectors for creating wealth and prosperity in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[148990]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are committed to eradicating child poverty within 20 years and to halving it within 10. Personal tax and benefit measures, announced during this Parliament, will lift more than one million children out of low income poverty; that includes an estimated 50,000 children in Wales. The Government and the National Assembly for Wales place a high priority on tackling the causes of poverty and social exclusion, as well as alleviating the symptoms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that during the Conservative Government from 1979 to 1997, child poverty trebled. We have made great inroads into that problem through record rises in child benefit, the new deal and the working families tax credit. Can he explain how the children's tax credit, which will be introduced in the Budget, will also help?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches on an important issue. Many of the changes that he mentioned—the working families tax credit, increases in child benefit and income support, and the minimum wage—have dramatically reduced child poverty in Wales. The Conservative party opposed those measures and, if elected, would abolish them. The child care tax credit, which is part of the working families tax credit, will help with 70 per cent, of child care costs, up to a maximum of £100 for one child and £150 for two or more children. Again, there is no warm welcome from the Conservative party, the major opposition party in Wales and the United Kingdom, for those measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[148991]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Per capita spending on policing in Wales was around £7 higher than for England, excluding the seven metropolitan forces, in 1997–98, rising to over £9

higher by 1999–2000. Per capita spending on policing in Wales during the past three years has been consistently level with the England and Wales average and consistently higher than the average for English shire forces. I have not, therefore, made any representations to the Home Secretary about the level of per capita funding and I will write to the hon. Gentleman with the full figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his reply. Will he nevertheless confirm that, if he included the metropolitan forces, per capita expenditure on police forces in Wales would be £15 less than in England? Will he also concede that, over the past three years, the amount—excluding or including metropolitan forces—paid out of central funds to police forces in Wales has gone down, resulting in an additional burden on the council tax payer in Wales? Should he not have at least made representations to the Home Secretary about that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong to compare those figures. He should compare like with like, and the equivalent police forces in England are those outside the metropolitan areas. We have had a very good deal on police funding in Wales, and if Wales were to become independent, we would have a much worse deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend aware of the dramatic turnaround in policing in the Vale of Glamorgan, which has recently become one of the safest constituencies in Wales? Does he agree that, as well as expenditure, reduction in the crime rate is due to having good coppers doing a good job, which is what has happened in my constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. He has been conscious in the past of the level of crime in his constituency.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that the Assembly is currently consulting on both the organisational matters to which she refers— community health councils and the abolition of health authorities. The Assembly will have the power to examine the future of community health councils, if the Bill currently in the Commons is passed, and it will consult further on the abolition of health authorities. Both are measures that it can consider independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key thing that my hon. Friend mentioned is resources. Whatever savings result from the abolition of health authorities, the National Assembly for Wales will have additional resources for the next couple of years due to the Government's major investment. The Assembly has received £1.35 billion from the Government, which it is allocating to health services. I remind my hon. Friend that that money would never have been given by a Conservative Government—and that Plaid Cymru could never have given it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four years ago, the country was told that it had only 24 hours to save the NHS. This week, an 87-year-old lady spent 24 hours on a trolley because a bed could not be found for her, and it has also been reported that 661 beds in Wales are blocked by elderly people because there is nowhere else for them to go, and the Llanclwyd hospital has had to close a 30 bed surgical ward because of staff shortages—it does not have enough trained nurses.

Yesterday, the Government admitted that their education policies have failed. Today, should they not admit that they have failed the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party has pledged to make £24 million of cuts in each constituency in Wales and to reduce taxes. Given that it is committed to such cuts in resources, can any hon. Member tell me how it would be able to direct more resources into the NHS? The £1.35 billion of extra spending on health would not have happened had the party of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) continued in office on 1 May, and there would be less money for the health service in Wales if his party were ever again to form the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not made an assessment of any such operating aids.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by that answer, bearing in mind the huge concern that is felt by Committee members about job losses in manufacturing. I ask the Secretary of State again to consider measures such as cuts in corporation tax and in national insurance employers' contributions, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
substantial tax breaks for research and development? Those are matters that he should be discussing with his colleagues, either in the National Assembly or at Westminster. He cannot sit by and say that they are matters for others to decide, because they are, in part, his responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, of course, aware that the National Assembly's Minister for Economic Development recently visited Brussels on a factfinding visit about operating aids. I am also aware that certain aids can be determined between the Assembly and the European Union. For example, the finance Wales loans products fall within the Assembly's area of responsibility, and I understand that the European Commission is expected to clear the loans of containing an aid element. The Assembly is also working with my right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister on a rate relief scheme for small businesses. The European Commission has to be involved in the matter. The Assembly and the Government are working jointly on that. In addition, the Treasury has proposed a community investment tax credit, which it is discussing with the Assembly. When the details are finalised, the proposal will have to be put to the European Commission. So the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) is wrong: the National Assembly and my Cabinet colleagues are taking up these matters with the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the implementation in Wales of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. I recently attended the launch of the community council for education and training in Monmouthshire. It has a rural focus, to reflect the training needs of a farming community that is currently under-trained. Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's position has been strongly outlined by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State. We strongly believe that Corus should reconsider its proposals. It has an opportunity to do that, and to examine a range of alternatives proposed by its work force. The Government are willing to discuss several issues with it in due course. My right hon.

I am sure that Corus needs to rethink its proposals. If it does not, the Government will consider the situation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the Secretary of State discussed crime reduction in that meeting because the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 make the reduction of crime a matter for every organisation and agency, including educational agencies.

However, I note with interest that, on Saturday, someone from the Wales Office contacted the 	<i>Western Mail</i> and extended the remit of the debate to include poverty and social exclusion.

	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of Building Safer Communities in Wales.</p></q>
Almost all the members of the Committee represent constituencies in Wales. Clearly, a debate on safer communities should cover the levels of crime, why crime exists and how we can eradicate it. As the debate progresses this morning and later this afternoon, I am sure that hon. Members will draw on a wide range of experiences to ensure that we debate what will or will not make for a safer Wales, not just the question of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime, poverty and worklessness are the deadliest threats to strong and safe communities, but they are not the only factors. The pensioner who is afraid to turn on the heating, the rural family without access to public transport, the young mother without access to child care, the child in a failing school—all those people suffer from the social exclusion that weakens our communities, and they expect action from us, as their representatives in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safe communities are not just those that are free of crime but those in which all our citizens have a stake and are listened to. The safe society is the responsible society, in which we take our duties to one another seriously. I am proud to say that the Labour Government have tackled and are tackling all those issues, often in partnership with the National
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Assembly for Wales. Our war on worklessness and poverty is at the very heart of our programme to modernise and strengthen Britain and Wales. We have introduced the new deal, the centrepiece of our action against social exclusion, which has taken 27,000 people off the dole queues in Wales. We understand that not only must we be tough on crime. Quite rightly, we must be tough as well on the causes of crime. Young people, particularly young men, without work will turn to crime. My hon. Friends and I know that; the Liberal Democrats believe it; so too, does the Welsh Nationalist party. Even the reformers of the Victorian era knew it a century ago, but I am not convinced that the Conservative party knows it. It proposes to abolish the new deal. Not for nothing did John Stuart Mill call the Tories the stupidest party. Their decisions are the latest manifestation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government also introduced a national minimum wage. For the first time, our adult citizens know that a floor has been put on the wages that employers can offer them. It is a guarantee of security in the workplace. For those on the Government Benches, it is a matter of human dignity, but the Conservative party fought for years to resist it. They told us that the minimum wage would cost jobs, but since its introduction, firms in Wales have taken on an additional 29,000 workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who supports the minimum wage, I welcome its extension. Is the Secretary of State aware that some young people aged 16 and 17 are being sacked as they approach the age of 18, so that employers can take on younger people at wages way below the minimum? Will the right hon. Gentleman discuss with his colleagues in the Government the possibility of introducing greater safeguards for those below the age of 18?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. All of those who support the national minimum wage deplore such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of growth in the number of jobs in Wales has accelerated, not declined, since the minimum wage was introduced. We should not forget the real human benefits of the minimum wage. More than 100,000 people, almost one in 10 of the working population in Wales, received a pay rise as a result—a pay rise that the Conservative party resisted for years. When they make their contribution to today's debate, those who speak from the Opposition Benches may wish to offer an apology for those years of black propaganda. They may wish to explain to the people of Wales why they did not deserve the safety and security brought by the minimum wage. Once the Conservatives have done that, they should promise not to cut it—if they are ever re-elected.

that people are now receiving about £2 an hour less? That is a scandal. Will the Government use the Budget to increase the minimum wage to at least £4 an hour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would get into awful trouble if I started saying what should be included in the Budget. Nevertheless, I take the general point that the hon. Gentleman makes about those who abuse the system. The problem should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of the overall strength of the economy in Wales, many families face tough times. The callous, short-term and fundamentally flawed decision by Corus to close Ebbw Vale and to shed jobs at Bryngwyn, Shotton and Llanwern is a case in point. Those who represent Welsh constituencies are unanimous in our demand that Corus should reconsider. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) certainly believes that, although he mentioned in the Assembly the other day that the steel industry could be taken back into public ownership That is not realistic; nor would it resolve the problems of the steel industry. I know that the right hon. Gentleman, like me, shares the frustration of those communities, but that is not the answer. The answer must be for Corus to think bigger, to think about the future and to understand that the steel industry in Britain has a future only if it can wait to ensure the right economic conditions. For example, if the exchange rate improves, the steel industry will survive. We know that our plants at Llanwern, Ebbw Vale, Shotton and Bryngwyn are among the most productive and efficient in western Europe. They stand up when compared to any plant in the world. It seems senseless to close them down when all that is needed to retain the jobs is to wait for the economy to change in a certain way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a wide debate, and I know that right hon. and hon. Members will bear its title in mind. I know that the right hon. Gentleman's intervention will be relevant to the debate. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the Secretary of State's remarks, which were in order and in which he named me, does he agree that the steel industry is a strategic industry? If control of the steel industry passes to the New York stock exchange and to directors of a supranational corporation, the United Kingdom cannot have a meaningful independent defence policy. That is of central relevance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that we are talking about whether Welsh communities can be safe. In my mind, there is no question that large-scale redundancies in Ebbw Vale and Newport—they have affected my constituency, as some of my constituents work in Llanwern—and in Shotton and Gorseinon will cause frustration, and that will put our steel communities at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point about the strategic nature of the steel industry, which is why we are asking Corus to reconsider and to take a

long-term view. The problem may be the euro, but we know that the exchange rate is improving every day, which affects the argument about UK markets. The steel industry has to understand that if the steelworks are closed, in part or wholly, they will never be able to reopen. Our capacity for steelmaking would inevitably reduce. In the long run, that must be bad for Wales and the UK. I do not believe that seizing assets is the answer. The industry should listen to the trade unions, and to us as public representatives, and think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State seems to be speculating, so what does he believe to be that the optimum euro-sterling exchange rate? That information could allow Corus to take an alternative decision. When does he expect the Chancellor to act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the Secretary of State will bear it in mind that any speculation should relate to the subject of our debate. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed, so I shall not go into the detail, even if I could. It would be of great interest to the City and the markets if a member of the Cabinet started speculating about that exchange rate. The policy of the Conservative party would mean that there was no decision on the euro for at least five years. I do not know what impact that would have on the steel industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take your admonition, Mr. Jones, about the nature of the debate, but I emphasise the fact that the safety of Welsh communities is unquestionably put at risk, because the steel closures are so crucial to the well-being of many of our constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend underline the strategic importance of the steel industry to building safer and more prosperous communities in Wales? I also look forward to hearing where the Mars Bar Marxist, given his earlier intervention, would get the money for the seizure of the assets of the steel industry in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, he will not get it from me. It is interesting to speculate on where any independent Welsh Government could find assets to pay off the shareholders of Corus, or another such company. However, I fear that we would be diverting the debate down a different path if we continued to discuss that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales mentioned in answers, I visited Newport, Ebbw Vale and Flintshire—in your company, Mr. Jones, on the latter occasion—to talk to community representatives and steel workers about the impact of such changes as might occur. In every one of those communities, the local authorities, the Members of Parliament, the Assembly Members and the steel workers have all asked Corus to reconsider. I hope that, on the day before the trade unions meet with the company to discuss the plans, the Committee will send a message that all of us who represent Welsh constituencies, irrespective of party allegiance, urge Corus to reconsider their plans.

I said at the outset that poverty and worklessness are not the only enemies of strong and safe communities, important though they are. Crime threatens our safety and security. That is why I am pleased to tell the Committee that police numbers in all Welsh areas have risen while the Labour Government have been in office. Recorded crime is falling. It may not be falling far enough, or fast enough, but we all remember the Tory years, when crime doubled and the then Prime Minister told us that there was no such thing as society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is very much a Welsh society, and no one suffered more from the increase in crime in the Conservative years than its poorest and most vulnerable members. That is why the Government are so determined to take swift action against the perpetrators of crime. In Wales, we have led the way by dealing speedily with young offenders. The best performing area in England and Wales is north Wales. Our crime detection rates are among the highest in the United Kingdom. We have established crime and disorder partnerships to involve the whole community in the fight against crime. Furthermore, in this parliamentary Session, we are introducing new measures to tackle specific problems such as antisocial behaviour and car crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime and other aspects of social exclusion do not affect only the urban areas of Wales; rural Wales has its problems, too. Subsidies for farmers alone will not solve the problems of rural Wales. We already provide more subsidy for farming in the United Kingdom—£3 billion a year—than to every other industry combined. We need to get better value for that money, and that is why I am pleased to offer my support and that of the Government to the Assembly's proposals to modulate that subsidy in Wales, to ensure that the wider rural communities, as well as farmers, benefit from that expenditure. Rural Wales is also the heart of the Welsh language, and so it is right for the Assembly to divert some money from paying for crops into strengthening our communities there as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh language is part of our common inheritance in Wales, whether or not we speak it. All of us should be committed to its flourishing as part of a strong and vibrant Wales. However, the English language is also part of that inheritance. There can be no place at the top table in a modern Wales for those who would seek to monitor or control the use of English in any part of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am touched by what the Secretary of State said about the Welsh language. Having started from a position of not understanding Welsh, David Davies, the Assembly Member for Monmouth, now gives regular interviews in that language on television and radio. Should the Secretary of State not follow his fine example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not make much sense. My hon. Friend would have to wait a long time for me to learn to give interviews in the Welsh language. As far as I am aware, Mr. Davies is many years younger than me. I am sure that his brain is more attuned to learning languages than mine. Nor do I accept that any pensioners who come to Wales and speak either
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
English or Welsh, are in some way a burden. They are a strong and growing part of our community. I welcome them to Wales and I hope that others will too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Assembly and the United Kingdom Government are doing more to strengthen our rural communities than modulating subsidies. Already the Assembly is investing in improved public transport in rural and less urban Wales. Millions of pounds are being invested in new rail schemes, including a welcome return of passenger services in the Vale of Glamorgan. That is a tribute as much to the campaigning skills of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) as to anything else. New investment of millions of pounds is being made in bus transport and the improvement of links between bus and rail transport, such as on the Heart of Wales line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Conservative party was in office, it destroyed our rural bus network through its devotion to privatisation and deregulation. It damaged our rail network through the same approach. We are fixing the problems. It takes time, but the improvements are being made. The party that wants to take over the Government of the United Kingdom, but which will not, proposes to return to its previous course of waging a war against the transport links of rural Wales. Indeed, just what is the Conservative party's policy on strengthening communities in Wales? It would destroy our public services with £16 billion of spending cuts. As well as affecting investment in public services, it would fundamentally undermine the devolution project, by withdrawing resources from the National Assembly for Wales. The Conservative party would return the economy to boom and bust—to the days of 15 per cent. mortgage rates and record repossessions. It would return us to the days of mass unemployment by abolishing the new deal.

Whether or not a general election is in prospect— one will happen eventually—all parties that represent Welsh people in the House of Commons should be able to set out the choices that confront the people of Wales in the months ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A challenge has been made and we await the answer of the Secretary of State for Wales. I am prepared to take part in a television debate in Wales during the general election, to explain our policy. Will he, unlike his party's leader who has run away from the television debate challenge, accept it? Yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman wants a conversation on television, we can have one next week. I am sure that there is no problem about that. I have two further predictions. First, the date of the general election will be some time before July 2002. Secondly, the result will be a renewed mandate for the Labour party to continue its programme of reform and modernisation, strengthening our society and protecting our communities; to abolish child poverty in Wales; to work for full employment in Wales; and to create a responsible society in which strong communities can be safe and fight crime together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifteen years ago, we were in the very darkest days of Thatcherism. The communities that we are discussing today, which we want to be safe and strong, were treated with contempt. Working people were treated as the enemy within and our young people were told to expect a future of not so much low skills as no skills. Those were dark days for our country. It seemed that we would never again enjoy the social solidarity that communities in Wales, in particular, have enjoyed, or the concern for others that marks out a truly strong society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neil Kinnock, formerly my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn and now a European Commissioner, thought otherwise. He urged us on in the face of adversity to hope for better days. "It can be done; it must done," he said. He represented all that the Labour party does and what is best in Welsh society, for our belief in the duties that we owe one another is more hard-headed than soft-hearted. We know that only by widening opportunity for all citizens can we build a truly safe society and safe communities in Wales. Since the day we were elected we have been doing that—fighting the evils of poverty, worklessness and social exclusion. We shall keep on fighting them in the next Parliament too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any discussion about building safer communities, the first issue to examine is the current rate of offending in Wales and the perceived rate of crime. If the current British crime survey is to be believed, reported crime figures have fallen slightly. A written answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) in 	<i>Hansard</i> on 8 January, at column 425–6W, about recorded crime for the year to March 2000, revealed that crime overall in Wales had decreased. That is of course welcome. However, Wales had a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
higher rate of violence against the person than other parts of the United Kingdom. The figure for England is 1,096 offences per 100,000 in England, compared with 1,292 per 100,000. There is a stark difference in those figures, so a problem exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the hon. Gentleman saw that in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> it was reported on 17 January that Gwent police insist that more violent crime is being recorded by the force because they are more proactive about targeting incidents of low-level disorder and making quick arrests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw that item and shall quote from a letter from the chief constable of Gwent shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent statistics show that violent crime has risen by 8 per cent., with, unfortunately, an even higher figure for north Wales, although apparently there is a slower rate for Wales as a whole. We cannot draw much comfort from the figures, but crime figures for Wales are, in the round, undoubtedly improving. I am sure that all hon. Members are pleased about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that we have demonstrated, in places such as Cardiff, ways of targeting violent crime, and that that example needs to be followed in every community in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right. The scheme was mentioned in a recent crime debate and I remember that the Minister of State warmly recommended it to all police forces. Use should be made of that pilot scheme wherever that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all crime in Dyfed Powys, 25.2 per cent. is violent crime. In comparison, 6.7 per cent of crime in Cleveland is violent crime, and in Warwickshire the figure is 7.3 per cent. Some areas of Wales plainly have a problem. Unfortunately, the present funding arrangements do not include additional resources for tackling that problem. In fact, the reverse is true. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) can argue her point later, or she may intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for 1999–2000 show expenditure of £7,416.2 million in England, or £140.39 per head, and in Wales £125.49 per head. We have had a debate about that, and it would be wasting time to go into it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane (Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quoted some statistics.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that later.

I will not go into per capita spending again. However, the figures provided by the House of Commons Library for overall police funding for 2001–02 show £147 per head in England and £132 in Wales. Wales received 5.1 per cent. of the budget—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just quoted figures from the House of Commons Library, but he did not say whether those figures were for all police forces in England and all those in Wales, or for all the shire forces in Wales and all those in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman was listening earlier, he will know that it cannot be otherwise than including the Metropolitan police. His intervention was rather strange, given that that fact was made plain by the Secretary of State more than once this morning. I will not accept interventions of that nature, as time is pressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the police grant reports for England and Wales, the disparity was investigated and the Minister of State at the Home Department promised that he would elaborate on the problem by letter. To be fair, I have only just written to him, so I cannot comment on the matter; it is on-going. I attended that debate—I was the only Welsh Member to do so, as a matter of interest, as we are all fired up about policing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales' share of the police grant for 2001–02 was 4.8 per cent. of the combined England and Wales budget. The proportion for Wales has been falling steadily. I return to the figures that I quoted earlier to the Secretary of State: 4.93 for 1997–98; 4.92 for 1998–99; and 4.89 for 1999–2000. Why is the budget decreasing in that way? It has nothing to do with per capita spend; it is all to do with the percentage of the overall budget. If I am wrong, then clearly the Home Office figures are wrong and the Library is wrong. However, if the right hon. Gentleman can find out whether I am wrong, I shall gladly give way in due course.

If the budget for Wales is decreasing, why is it decreasing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not decreasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the figures suggest that the budget is decreasing as a proportion of the whole. It may be that the apportionment is mechanistic and not enough attention is paid to the need of Welsh police forces. In theory, the grants are meant to reflect the needs-based formula, but in practice they do not deliver that at all, as is evident from what I have just said.

London receives extra money, as it should do because it is a national capital city with extra functions. Cardiff, however, does not, and I should like to know why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have just said that— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the right hon. Gentleman had listened, he would know that I mentioned London's distinct national and capital city functions. I have already recognised the point that he made. My point is that Cardiff is the national capital of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just revealed his national tendencies again. The Metropolitan police force has responsibilities that run across the whole of England and Wales. The police force in Cardiff is extremely important, and as a representative of a Cardiff constituency I take a great interest in it, but its responsibilities are not comparable to the England and Wales—the UK—responsibilities of the Metropolitan police, which are reflected in its resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we differ on that. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] It causes great mirth when we argue on such stupid points.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did rebut them. There can be no comparison between the responsibilities of the two police forces. For example, how many embassies are there in Cardiff that need policing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just told the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that there is a difference, and I repeat that to the hon. Lady. However, I also argue that Cardiff has responsibilities that should be recognised, and that are increasing. There is a consulate in Cardiff, and representation from the Irish embassy.

One or two Governments have representations in Cardiff. There will be additional pressures when there are international matches such as the world cup.

I return to the alleged 6.1 per cent. increase in funding to the North Wales police that the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) mentioned. Before I dwell on that figure, I shall refer to some interesting points that Mr. Tom O'Donnell, the director of finances and resources of the North Wales police authority, raised in a letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says that, on the face of it, North Wales police have been treated fairly, with an extra grant of £875,000 earmarked for them. It will be used for much-needed new security at the Mostyn docks, and that is welcomed by all. However, Mr. O'Donnell goes on to point out that without that, the increase in the central Government grant would be 5.1 per cent., which is about average. He sees that as a standstill in funding rather than a growth in real terms. Yet police costs, including pay and pensions commitments, are increasing. I therefore dispute the figures given by the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quote a source back at the hon. Gentleman. It is bobbies on the beat that matter to the public in north Wales—in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and in mine. I quote Bill Brereton, the North Wales assistant chief constable, who said on 30 October 2000:
	<br><q><p>"We are obviously delighted that we are going to see more police officers in North Wales. The recent announcements by the Government can only strengthen our position and we will use the resources to the best of our ability to ensure our vision of a safer North Wales."</p></q>
That is from a person in the know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reference to the extra 40 officers. That is a good move, which I wholeheartedly accept. However, I am not talking about that. I am talking about the police budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The officers cost money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course they do, but that was a one-off. The hon. Gentleman can wave his paper until the cows come home, but he is wrong. It was a one-off grant to bring another 40 policemen into the North Wales police force. The move came from the Government and is most welcome, but it has nothing to do with the settlement.

There are 6,738 police officers in Wales, roughly equivalent per capita to the number in England. There can be no denying that Wales has as many policemen on the beat per capita as England, and I welcome that. However, there are pockets of problems throughout Wales. Keith Turner, the chief constable of Gwent constabulary, wrote to me to highlight some of his force's concerns. He gave me a copy of a letter that he wrote in December to Catherine Byrne of the Police Resources Unit of the Home Office, in which he wrote:
	<br><q><p>"I write to express my extreme disappointment that this force has again been adversely treated by the application of the current funding formula with a below average increase of 4.4 per cent. Last year, we were similarly disadvantaged and received a very low increase in funding and one of the lowest in England and Wales."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
We should bear it in mind that the detection rate of the Gwent police is one of the highest in the UK, so, considering their resources, they do a fine job. He continues:
	<br><q><p>"It appears to me to be a perverse situation where a funding formula that purports to take into account workload drivers and social deprivation factors which are acknowledged indicators of need, continues to deprive the public of Gwent of police resources.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>In so far as crime is concerned, this force has historically been a high crime area. In the latest published statistics we were 8th in England and Wales in terms of crime per 1,000 head of population. We are in a group of most similar forces, which includes South Wales Police, Cheshire, West Yorkshire, Humberside, South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire. Only 3 of those forces have a higher crime rate than Gwent whereas 4 are lower. Incidentally, our rate of crime per 1,000 head of population is the highest in Wales."</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"The recent funding proposals in respect of the National Criminal Intelligence Service and National Crime Squad levies for this force indicate an increase of 52 per cent. This enormous £760,000 increase is 1 per cent. of our total budget and I would strongly oppose this wholly unreasonable increase, which will further denude the service available for the public of Gwent.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Last year this force undertook a significant delayering of its headquarters support services, which were intended for redistribution to front-line services. The poor settlement meant that such savings were required to balance the budget and even so, we had to severely curtail our planned investment in IS/IT and other areas. Last year in order to maintain operational capability, the Police Authority were required to precept an increase of 26 per cent. on council taxpayers. I know that such financial support will not be forthcoming this year and therefore our comparable position is set to worsen. We have recently been inspected by HM Inspector of Constabulary who points to the need for a significant investment in IS/IT to support operational officers. This year's settlement will not allow us to address these pressing concerns and I fear that our momentum could falter.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I am also aware that since our 4 police divisions are all producing reductions in crime and superb detection results, they will have potential to become Beacon BCUs. It seems perverse in the extreme that our success appears to be penalised rather than rewarded.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Many of the law and order initiatives contained in Her Majesty the Queen's Speech concerning the forthcoming legislative programme will require additional police officer attention and activity. Although welcome, such measures have to be sustainable and our relatively low settlement means we will again be at a disadvantage in comparative terms.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>You will be aware that we achieved our efficiency plan last year and are well on track for this year's programme, however, only a small proportion"—</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will paraphrase, but I am concerned that the advice of a chief constable in one of the most successful constabularies in Wales is not being heeded.

However, Gwent's police funding will rise by £3.2 million, or 4.4 per cent. in the next financial year, making it more than £75 million. It will also receive £1 million from the crime-fighting fund, which will provide 81 additional recruits. He rightly points out the highly successful

rate of detection; the sixth greatest drop in crime among the 26 forces in the United Kingdom occurred in Gwent. He can rest assured that Gwent Members are taking those matters up, but he must also accept that a generous settlement has been agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not argue that point except to say that the 4.4 per cent. settlement is agreed, as referred to in the letter, but it is not satisfactory to the chief constable. However, I am sure that the Secretary of State will follow that up in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What conclusion does the hon. Gentleman draw from that? The reason why the lowest increase is going to an area—north and west Wales—with roughly double the rate of violent crime is that the Government have acceded to the argument for increasing spending on rural policing. Now that we have done that, the hon. Gentleman is arguing with the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all received the letter from the chief constable of Gwent on that matter. The hon. Gentleman cannot blame the Government for giving in to the argument made by the Opposition. If he chooses that tack—he must reach some conclusion on his position—he is arguing that the next settlement should be a reduction for his area and an increase in Gwent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is very kind in allowing interventions, but I must add that some interventions are too long. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, like many other hon. Members, have argued about the sparsity of rural policing. That point has been accepted by the Home Office, which is most welcome, but why should it mean cuts in other areas? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) seems to be saying that there is a finite budget so if some rural areas have succeeded, other urban areas cannot succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 4.4 per cent. for Gwent includes a portion for the rural areas, so there is an increased distortion. The hon. Gentleman must recognise that the settlement for Gwent is far above inflation and will mean an increase in police officers on the street. He must also accept that there is a lack of logic in his argument. He cannot ask for special treatment for some areas and complain when it is given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing in favour of Gwent's situation and have been asked to highlight its problems. The hon. Member for Newport, West may shake his head but a rurality problem exists in Dyfed-Powys and north Wales. That has been recognised, which I accept is a step forward. I will not argue that point further, but if the hon. Gentleman catches the Chairman's eye perhaps he can develop it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief constable referred to several welcome initiatives in the Queen's Speech such as the arrangement to keep registers of paedophile offenders. That is a hot, but very important, subject. Such initiatives, however, mean that the police need extra resources to comply with them. There are many good initiatives before the House, but they all have resource implications that place further strain on police forces.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
The notion that I find least appealing in the Criminal Justice and Police Bill is on-the-spot penalties for people who are drunk or anti-social in public. They are unfortunate because they make the police officer judge and jury. It is difficult to prove that such behaviour has occurred and an immediate penalty may lead to more disorder—if a person is inebriated, he or she may take umbrage at being so accused. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Once again, the main contribution from the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd is to laugh, but I am making a serious point. Liberty believes that it is absolutely wrong that the police should be both judge and jury, and I agree. However, the travel restriction orders in the Bill are helpful, although they will require extra policing.

I do not know how child curfew schemes will work in practice. Indeed, I am unsure whether they will work, and what resources they will require. It is also possible that they will face a challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Child curfews do not resolve the causes of children's misbehaviour, and sometimes they exacerbate it. Frequently, children's misbehaviour is caused by their home environment, and curfews offer only a temporary cure of the symptoms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I am wholeheartedly against child curfews. However, as a matter of historical interest, until the 1860s, the young people of Dolgellau were known as "Bois y cloc naw", because there is an old clock tower in the centre of the town and the police would take home any youngster who was out on the streets after 9 pm. I was a proud, although not a very talented, member of the Dolgellau male voice choir, and its badge has the clock tower on it with the time at 9 pm. So, child curfew has been tried and tested in Meirionnydd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are parts of north Wales where we have tried and tested most things, and the hon. Gentleman is right to appeal to our roots and history. However, Scotland offers a more contemporary example. It has been demonstrated that if curfews are properly applied, with the support of the community and the involvement of parents, they can have positive effects on the adverse behaviour of young people and prevent them from getting into more trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the right hon. Gentleman has more knowledge of such matters than me. If that model is worth while, let us see how it works. If it will operate by means of a joint approach involving parents and, perhaps, social workers, let us see whether that is the way forward. The issue of child curfew is more complicated than some bald statements about it might suggest, and the hon. Gentleman may be right in highlighting that example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a truism that innocent people should not be concerned about providing fingerprints or DNA, but it is unacceptable to me that the police might permanently keep samples that have been voluntarily given. My big concern is that that might deter people

from volunteering. That would be a step in the wrong direction. Undoubtedly, the matter will be debated at length in connection with the Criminal Justice and Police Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that closed circuit television is very useful. I recently met concerned residents of Moghred in the Clwyd, West constituency, which has a limited CCTV scheme that has greatly improved matters in most of the town. However, in the week before my visit, an armed robbery had taken place in a shop that is just outside the CCTV area. I understand that resources are finite, but CCTV schemes tend to move crime along, and the lady to whom I spoke in that shop was desperately unhappy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look carefully at such schemes because, in that town, a single extension of CCTV would have covered the entire commercial area. Perhaps schemes should be extended so that they do not cover just part of the commercial area and push crime into the areas that are not covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Gentleman on that point. My principal constituency towns of Prestatyn and Rhyl have benefited greatly from CCTV. However, towns such as Denbigh are concerned that crime has been pushed out to other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman welcome the investment that my constituency has received? In March 1997, £95,000 was awarded to a scheme in Prestatyn and, in January 2000, £159,000 was awarded to schemes in Rhyl. That shows the Government's commitment to extending CCTV coverage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing with the hon. Gentleman; I agree with him. I have a lengthy list of approved schemes in Wales, about which I am very pleased. However, we need to examine carefully where such schemes are placed and, if possible, negate the danger of passing crime on to outlying areas. Of course, there have been several good schemes, and I hope that they will come to fruition and that we will benefit from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intended to refer to the rurality aspect that has already been debated. I applaud the Government for introducing the measure, as rural policing has been a great problem for the North Wales police, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's decision of last week to give volunteer groups free access to the Criminal Records Bureau. I think that that is an excellent step forward; it shows that, sometimes, the voices of pressure groups are heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neighbourhood watch schemes are greatly valued by the police. I should like to see them put on a more official footing because they are currently somewhat piecemeal. The schemes are valued in some areas, but in others, perhaps where officers are snowed under with paperwork, they are treated as something of a nuisance. I am sure that an official recognition of the partnership would assist that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In conclusion, we need to use more community-based penalties in dealing with offenders. I am not alone in saying that; Lord Justice Wolff and other commentators who understand the issue have said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
that. It is not a soft option, and often prison is not an adequate solution. People we send to prison come out toughened and even more proficient at crime than they were when they went in and, unfortunately, often with a drug habit. My 25 years of experience indicates that, even for serious offences, community-based penalties often pay off and are far better. Offenders have to think more and for a longer time about their wrongdoings, and they have to make restitution to society. Generally speaking, the reoffending rates of offenders who have been dealt with by community penalties are far lower than for those who have been sent to prison. We should use community penalties more creatively and more often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State rightly said, social exclusion is one aspect of the problem. After generations of poverty, people might feel that they are in a hopeless position. It is evident that some people in a hopeless position turn to crime. That is not to say that everyone who is poor is a criminal, but crime is prevalent in socially excluded areas. I commend the report of the Welsh Affairs Committee on social exclusion, and I welcome the urgent manner in which the National Assembly is addressing the problem. I am pleased that the Government's social exclusion unit is concentrating on the problem. We need to work together to build stronger communities and to bring the alienated and disillusioned back into the mainstream. With the political will that is now prevalent, that will be done with assured success in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not just consider the topic of building safer communities in Wales but that, as Members of Parliament, we will commit ourselves to leading the campaign to do that. Let us issue a challenge to every local authority, police division and public body in Wales to take on the job of cutting crime and disorder. The tools are now there for doing that. In addition, over the past three years, a serious start has been made on a long-term, sustainable reduction in crime and disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the first time, we have information, division by division, on the levels of crime and disorder, offences per head and offences such as violence. We have information about our own areas. The strategies that are built as a result of the crime and disorder audit should target the crime and disorder that we all know exists within our constituencies. Those divisional statistics at the local level where most crime happens are a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tools have been provided in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which deal with punishment and the equipment to deal with people who have offended. Also, there is a strategic approach, which involves, first, auditing crime and disorder; secondly, listening to the views of communities and learning from the experience of ordinary people; and, thirdly, putting a strategy into place with effective targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
We have the crime reduction budget. Not only is there the increase in police finances to which we have already referred, but the budget provides for specific targeted activity to reduce crime and the burden on both communities and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) refer to the importance of the social exclusion unit. There is no doubt that the work of that unit has led to joined-up thinking across government, on issues such as unemployment and the new deal, to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred, and on housing, transport and other factors in the creation of safer communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the springboard year. The first strategies had to be in place by April 1999, showing how each part of our nation would reduce crime and disorder in the local divisional area and in the local authority area. Three years later, that occasion comes around again. A fresh strategy must be in place by April 2002, with a baseline redrawn according to what is actually happening in each area. The work for that should have already started. I chaired a conference recently, at which I asked those attending—police officers, crime reduction officers and local authority officers—about their time scale for gathering information in preparation for April 2002. Some said that they would begin by summer this year, others that they would begin by the autumn, but some two thirds of those present did not know what the target for our area was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of the target is not particularly important. It can be approached in two ways—one can consult people, and feed the results of that consultation into the findings, the statistical approach and ultimately into the strategy, or one can collect the statistics first and hold consultations on them. However, it is important that every division and local authority in Wales recognises the importance of meeting the target. We must recognise the reality of crime and disorder, and listen to people. A council estate, an inner-town area or a specifically vulnerable group must not be left out of the process because not enough has been done to make sure that the targets are properly understood. The problems must be identified, the hotspots of crime must be focused upon and the work must be done. That job is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a lot about the financial pressures. There are such pressures on Cardiff and other cities, but that is allowed for in the formula used to allocate the money for each police authority area. I am pleased to hear the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy acknowledge the extra cash that has been given to rural police forces. Rurality has helped three Welsh forces, including Gwent. That is because, when I was Minister of State at the Home Office, I set in motion research to identify the extent of rurality. In focusing on the problems, a balance must be struck between rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no such thing as a perfect formula. However, it is clear that problems would increase massively if police resources were cut, and if resources for other sectors such as education, training or employment were also cut. That is what would happen
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
If we were to have a Conservative Government after the next election and they made their promised £16 billion cut in public expenditure. It is important to use existing resources to target the real ills of our society. Police responses must be improved. There should be effective partnership between police, local authorities and others. Crime must be cut and our communities must be safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy called for more action in the community, both in terms of community penalties and on the propensity to commit crime, but he also seemed to criticise some of the tools that will enable such action to be taken at local level. On curfews, I ask the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. 0£pik) to examine the detail. A structure for the use of curfews is required, within which, the police and local authorities must consult each other and the community—the parents—on whether there is a problem to be dealt with. If there is a problem, such as the one to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy presumably contributed by creeping around after 9 o'clock in Dolgellau in his younger days—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman seems to be admitting that he still does that. Problems in the local community should be tackled. Far too often, we hear the police and others say that they can do nothing about the bad behaviour and depredations of youngsters, and that we have to put up with them. We do not, because the Government are introducing measures to ensure that problems can be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an open mind on curfews, but I wish that they had been given a different name, as I think that the term sends young people the wrong signals. Antisocial behaviour orders need a partnership approach. Although I can pinpoint two places in my area where the community wants ASBOs, we cannot establish them between the police and the local authority. Surely we should make the existing tools work before we try to pile more restrictions on young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people who will gain most from curfews are young people, as young people are the most frequent victims of crime, especially violent crime. By saying that young people should be in at night to get ready for school and so on, we will protect them not only from themselves, but from becoming victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage the hon. Gentleman to do what I did about ASBOs, which was to tell the police and the local authority that there was no excuse not to make the orders. The difficulty of exchanging information between the two is no excuse. Although police and local authorities already had the power to exchange information for the reduction of crime, we included a big section on the subject in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to clarify matters. If the police and the local authority in the hon. Gentleman's area are not using ASBOs, they are failing the community and failing to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
prevent crime, as there is evidence that ASBOs lead not only to punishment, which they should do, but to the reduction of antisocial behaviour in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about curfews being used as an independent tactic. The right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the 1998 Act and its guidance require a strategic partnership approach. I have checked with the Home Office, and similar guidance is to be issued in relation to the curfews for those aged up to 16. I am glad to know that he will welcome them. I share his view that they should only be used appropriately and after proper consultation and discussion with the local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the reluctance of police forces and local authorities to use ASBOs is the cost, as each one costs about £5,000 to process. I understand that the Home Office is about to announce that it will reimburse police and local authorities for the cost. Does my right hon. Friend have that information, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard that. My hon. Friend will have to get a reply from a Home Office Minister. I do not think that it is acceptable to say that cost is an excuse. We must ask how much police time, and that of local authority officials, will be saved if a problem that is causing many complaints and misery in a community is brought under control. ASBOs sound cheap at half the price, and they should be used. When I spoke to the chief constable and deputy chief constable of the South Wales police and his deputy, I was satisfied that they sought to learn the lessons from the existing ASBOs, to ram home the message to one or two thugs or villains who had created misery around them and to get on with the job.

I contest the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy's reference to on-the-spot penalties. We have seen the extent to which penalties for motoring offences are respected. We have seen the extent to which penalties for motoring offences are respected. The vast majority are paid, which avoids bureaucracy in the courts and saves paperwork and cost. Above all, it saves the time that police officers have to spend waiting in court for cases to be heard. Perhaps the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy should have declared an interest as a member of the legal profession, because on-the-spot fines produce savings in legal costs. People often admit that they were in the wrong and pay the penalty, although they still have the freedom to contest their case in court. That, surely, is an appropriate balance—or does the hon. Gentleman seek to defend the legal profession, which makes a great deal of money from such cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only a tiny percentage of people challenge speeding fines, and policemen do not routinely have to wait in traffic courts. Indeed, they are not often to be seen there; I took a traffic court about

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first sat in a police court dealing with motoring offences nearly 30 years ago, and many police then sat waiting in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Times have changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. Those police officers are now out on the streets instead of waiting in court. That represents a net increase in the number of police officers, although it is not properly accounted for. On-the-spot fines will make a similar contribution. The police will not have to sit waiting in court whenever they arrest people for rowdy behaviour if they can impose on-the-spot fines. Those who are fined will probably admit to being out of order and pay up—and may even think about not behaving like that again. There will be a net gain in people's behaviour, and the police will not have to waste time in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that other hon. Members want to speak, but I want to make two quick points. We want to cut crime, and we have proved that it can be done. The Government have a proud record, which has already been acknowledged. The figures prove it. The statistics show a 4.9 per cent. cut in recorded crime in Dyfed-Powys, a 7.2 per cent. cut in Gwent and a 16.9 per cent. cut in south Wales, the biggest cut in England and Wales. The figures show a slight increase in north Wales, but the figures for the three years from 1997 show Dyfed-Powys down by 11 per cent. Gwent down by 3.1 per cent., north Wales down by 9.1 per cent. and south Wales down by a massive 24.5 per cent. Those are successive year-on-year decreases, not blips. We are moving forward in a sustainable way. It is important that those decreases continue year after year. The Government were right to set ambitious targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was generous enough to recognise that violent crime, too, can be cut. During in the past few years, we have seen a worrying increase in violent crime. I pay tribute to the work that has been done in that respect in Cardiff, and I am pleased that academic scrutiny is being applied to the realities of that work by Professor Mike Maguire and Professor Rob Morgan. The work that was undertaken involved Professor Jon Shepherd, who has analysed what is going on in the accident and emergency units. He found that a number of offences were not being recorded or reported. The realities of violent crime are being tackled in Cardiff, not only those cases that are reported to the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the work being done by Professor Shepherd at the University Hospital of Wales in my constituency, with the help of the crime prevention group, has contributed to the huge rise in the number of reported incidents in the Cardiff area? I believe that it is about 50 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. The reason is the existence of a strong partnership. The work was done by a medic, who recognised that crime is something to do with the health service. That needs to be recognised in every part of Wales, and it has not happened yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another significant contribution was the work done by the local authority, led by councillor Gordon Houlston, its deputy leader and the deputy lord mayor, and the Safer Cardiff team led by Barbara Natesagara. Now money from the Home Office is being made available to accelerate the process and enable more to be learned. The relevant team, led by Inspector Tony Rees, is concentrating specifically on violent crime. Lessons have been learned and reductions have been achieved, but instead of declaring the work complete, the Home Office is supporting local partnership initiatives and advocating further efforts to reduce crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Home Office has sent the Cardiff violence prevention group's leaflet to every accident and emergency consultant and to jaw and face consultants throughout the country, challenging them to act accordingly. Different approaches from those used in Cardiff may be needed elsewhere, such as in Ysbyty Gwynedd or Carmarthenshire hospitals, to suit local requirements. The important factor is that the problem should be jointly recognised and that there should be willingness to get on with the job, as has been shown to be possible with the right will, partnership and co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service needs particularly to take note of the fight against drugs. I should be very surprised if the new analysis of crime and disorder that is being undertaken for the new strategy in April 2002 did not produce recognition of a drugs problem in most areas. One problem is that when people are identified as involved with or misusing drugs, treatment is often not available to enable them to withdraw from that activity. There is a need for health authorities in Wales, while we still have them, and the health service as a whole, to recognise their responsibility to help reduce such activity. In the long term that should help to reduce treatment costs, and in the short term it would help to reduce crime and disorder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of partnership, I hope that, looking forward to their strategies for next year, local authorities will, as part of their contribution, examine the extension of entitlement. Exciting proposals have come from the National Assembly for establishing a community-based youth service approach. That means that, in contrast to the system in England, about which I have grave reservations, the organisation will be targeted at partnership between the local authority and voluntary organisations in the local authority area—exactly where crime is being tackled. That will enable a proper exercise to be carried out. The youth offending teams will also cover the same areas, making it possible for those concerned to work together on the essential task of nipping the initial involvement of young offenders in the bud, before they ruin their own lives and the life of the community. That must be one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
of our most important targets. I want to celebrate the fact that we are now closer to that target in south Wales than anywhere in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary I went with my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General to meet judges, police and those involved in the court system to find out about the work being undertaken towards the target of halving the time taken to bring young offenders to court. We inherited the scandalous figure of an average of 142 days. Even 71 days is still a long time in the life of a young person, but it is more manageable. I commend the way in which the courts in south Wales are approaching that target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I visited the magistrates courts in Cardiff last month I was excited—that is the only word I can use— by what I saw. I served as a magistrate in the juvenile courts before I entered Parliament and everyone felt that we were pushing a big stone uphill all the time. On my visit last month I witnessed a sense of partnership and movement. Magistrates feel that they can do something because cases come before them early enough. Prosecutors working for the Crown Prosecution Service feel that they are going to court with the information and authority to deal properly with their cases. Members of the youth offending teams feel that, with the final warning and the speeding up of the system, they can work with young offenders who have been convicted and have the chance to make a difference before it is too late. That positive feeling should be celebrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cutting crime and creating safer communities takes time. It does not happen overnight. In the past three years, however, we have taken major steps forward. Our area is responding better than many parts of the country, although every part of the country will have to meet the target. We are on the way. In the coming 12 months, we will have another chance to audit crime in our area, consult the local community and ensure that local authorities and the police fulfil their joint responsibility in the plan for action and the coming three-year programme. As Members of Parliament, we have the chance to play our part in working with all those organisations to ensure that our communities are made safer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have an opportunity to make a short contribution to today's debate. I was in Swansea last Thursday, and decided to read the 	<i>South Wales Evening Post.</i> Some of the comments that we have heard today have suggested that everything is rosy and that there is no problem. There is an air of complacency, about which we should be cautious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, I agree with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) about drugs. I am a vice-chairman of the all-party group on drugs misuse, and drugs must be one of the greatest evils to confront society in Britain and the world. Drugs pose a threat to families, and we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
know that much crime is drug-related. We do not simply have to detect people on drugs and lock them up. We must assist those on drugs who, in the main, want to break the dependency that they have built up, perhaps over many years. We must do what we can to ensure that there are sufficient beds and treatments available for such people, so that they can get off drugs as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by how many stories in the 	<i>South Wales Evening Post</i> were crime-related. Headlines included "Knife terror in bookie hold-up", "Raiders take video recorder", "City caught in grip of heroin 'disaster'"— that refers to Swansea—and "Man guilty of assault charge". The story with the headline "Early release man in prison" read:
	<br><q><p>"A Penlan man who committed two theft offences after being released early from prison has been sent back behind bars for more than a year."</p></q>
I am delighted about that, as, I am sure, is the community in which he lived. However, many people will question the early release that allowed him to carry out those extra crimes within a month of leaving prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a coastal constituency, and am interested to hear what impact the hon. Gentleman thinks that the previous Government's cuts in Customs and Excise have had on the import of the drugs that we are all trying to fight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The drugs menace in this country has grown inexorably over many years. The hon. Lady will know that not only drugs but alcohol and tobacco are smuggled into the country, which is leading to further crime throughout the whole United Kingdom. We need to increase the number of Customs and Excise points throughout the UK. We live in an island community, and we should use that fact to help to eradicate crime, which includes the import of drugs, alcohol and tobacco. We should consider Customs and Excise again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to Dover a few years ago, after indicative allowances were scrapped, and saw people in white vans bringing enormous amounts of alcohol and tobacco into the country. I noticed that no cars were stopped, only vans. We must consider the number of Customs and Excise points and their operation, so that we give them proper support. I am certain that Customs and Excise staff want to be more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the reduction in the overall amount of crime in Wales. After a period during which it increased, it has started to dip, and I would be the first to welcome any overall decrease. Although it has decreased in three out of four police areas, it has increased in one. The issue of notifiable offences is worrying. In 1997, there were 17,386 recorded incidents of violence against the person. Today, that figure stands at 37,922. There were 811 recorded incidents of robbery in 1997. That figure stands at 909 today. The total number of incidents of violent crime has risen from 20,071 in 1997 to 40,580. Fraud and forgery have doubled from 5,757 incidents to almost 12,000. The total number of incidents recorded in 1997 was 236,936. For the year 1999–2000,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
the figure was 255,487. Between 1997 and 2000, that figure has gone up, but I am delighted that we have seen an overall dip in the figures for this year. That decrease must go even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most concerned about violent crime. Some 13 per cent. of people living in the Newport division have been victims of violence. A BBC Online report states:
	<br><q><p>"Overall figures for England and Wales show that robberies— most of them muggings—increased by 19 per cent. compared with a fall of nearly 6 per cent. over the previous 12 months. The number of sexual offences also rose over the same period."</p></q>
I spoke earlier about early release. I have enormous reservations about that. As of 30 November 2000, 29,253 offenders have been placed on the early release scheme. Of those offenders, 62 were convicted of manslaughter, seven of attempted murder, 3,817 of woundings, actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm, 4,000 of drug offences, 35 of sex offences, 2,732 of burglary and 1,234 of robbery. As of 30 November, 1,019 of those curfews have been breached, and offenders who were on that scheme have committed 1,000 crimes. As the case of the Penlan man has shown, early release causes enormous problems. When people on the scheme commit further crimes, it is thrown completely into question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the early releases that go wrong are a matter of great concern, but does the hon. Gentleman not agree that the system, including the introduction of tagging, has been successful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous reservations, even about tagging. I will go on to support the Home Secretary's recent remarks. I hope that the hon. Lady will appreciate what I have to say. Many, if not all, members of the Committee will know that over the Christmas period, somebody came into my business in Swansea and stole a case of beer. When I chased the thief, I was punched in the face. That led—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I can hear the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. 0£pik) making a joke of it, but this happens to many people, perhaps in his own constituency, and they may not find it funny. I certainly did not, when it happened to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I take the issue very seriously. I was making a gentle aside, and I apologise to him if he thought that I was making a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's apology. When I was punched in the face, the police were quick to arrive on the scene. Thanks to certain information, the person was apprehended. When he appeared before the court he was released on unconditional bail, and then went on to commit a further crime. We must all question that sort of justice. By a further crime, I mean that an elderly person—at least, someone older than me—was injured badly and needed medical treatment. We must question the sort of society that gives rise to such crimes. Despite the publicity that was given to the theft at my business, two more thefts have taken place. Only last week, someone brazenly walked in, stole a mobile telephone from the shop display and threw it to an accomplice;
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
they ran off together. We have reported that theft to the police, but we know the two people involved and we shall give the police every assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My greatest concern is that people going about their normal daily work are confronted by people who are completely brazen and who do not have the same standards as us. The right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth spoke about unruly yobs being fined on the spot, but I think back to my days in Swansea when thousands of people were pouring out of night clubs at 2 am. It would be wrong to expect the police to approach them, and it would be wrong to expect offenders to be rational about paying fines on the spot. Indeed, I wonder whether, in trying to impose such fines, the police would lay themselves open to attack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A common-sense approach is needed. People who are given a notice need time to decide whether to accept what they have been accused of. It may help, in advance of that outpouring from the night club, if a policeman dealing with a fairly small incident can impose an on-the-spot fine and therefore remain available to patrol the streets for the rest of the evening. Otherwise, he has to return to the police station to complete the paperwork—and also lose a day when appearing before the court a few weeks later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Instant justice sounds fine, but the theory will be completely different from the reality. An on-the-spot notice means that the police officer has to communicate with the person, who may be drunk or on drugs, and take his name and address. The police officer who confronts someone like that would soon be crowded by others, who would take an interest in the questioning of their friend. We need to think about it. If the Government insist on going down that route, they must pilot the scheme first. They need to know what is likely to happen when those clubs start to empty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, piloting has much to commend it. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the police would not be compelled to make such decisions on the spot if it was not appropriate? We can trust the common sense of the police not to use on-the-spot fines in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what can happen at 2 am. Licensing reform may assist by spreading the times at which people pour out of night clubs on Friday and Saturday nights over several hours. I remember that Swansea police used to pray for rain because it made the crowds disperse more quickly. I have enormous sympathy for the police. There is always a police presence in Swansea on busy nights. I know that the police will use their common sense in such situations, but piloting would throw up possible problems and calm people's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) about my fears of early release and tagging. The Home Secretary himself had a difference of opinion with Lord Woolf, but I firmly backed the Home Secretary. In a Prison Reform Trust lecture, Lord Woolf said that, rather than opening more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
prisons, he would prefer prisons to close and more people to do community service. I heard what the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) had to say about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary said that he would prefer to see such criminals in prison, and I agree. Indeed, he spoke of the 100,000 offenders who are responsible for about 50 per cent. of crime. We know, as do the police, which individuals are plaguing our communities. People who live in decent communities pray that those who commit those crimes will be sent to prison. Even if they are put on remand, it is at least some respite for the communities. I would welcome any Government measure that ensured that persistent offenders were removed from the community, that they were given custodial sentences when appropriate and that they had to serve the time for which they were put away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Christmas, my car windscreen was smashed; and I have been told that it has happened to others who live nearby. It defies logic that someone can pick up a brick, walk down the street and, at will, smash the windscreens of cars whose owners are unknown to them. However, those who live in the neighbourhood often know who is committing crimes. Any assistance that can be given to the police to get those criminals off the streets must be welcomed. I sometimes feel sorry for the police, because they spend many man-hours detecting criminals, who are taken to court and then let out, or given soft or lenient sentences. That is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we must try to put the matter in context? More than 30,000 home detention curfews have been issued, but only 533 prisoners—1.8 per cent. of the total—have been convicted, charged or are awaiting prosecution for offences committed while on curfew. I accept that it is a difficult matter, but more than 29,500 people are now not offending. The hon. Members for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and for Woking (Mr. Malins) gave the scheme unanimous backing in the Home Affairs Select Committee report. The hon. Gentleman must consider the matter in context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who has been the victim of a crime committed by someone on early release will question that scheme. We must be cautious about who is let out. Indeed, I would stop the scheme, because those who have been convicted ought to serve their sentences. We all know that those who are convicted represent the tip of the iceberg and that much crime is undetected. We should support the police. I hope that the time lag between arrest and cases coming to court can be shortened, but we must also be sure that those criminals serve the full sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that individuals will eventually be released from prison? A scheme that can help them to stop reoffending is in the nation's long-term interests and it will help build the safer communities that we both seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that. Indeed, we debated the Prison Service yesterday. We must consider what happens to prisoners while they are in custody, and we must see what can be done about their education and rehabilitation, especially if drugs are involved. I know that much has been done to try to clear some of our prisons of drugs, but they are not all drug free. We must do what we can to ensure that prisons become drug free and that those who are dependent on drugs are treated for their dependency while in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Car crime has been mentioned. The latest statistics show that south Wales is now the sixth worst place in Britain for vehicle crime, which includes criminal damage, tampering with vehicles, aggravated driving and taking away, theft of valuables or simple vehicle theft. A vehicle crime takes place 133 times a day in south Wales. The 480,269 car-related crimes in the 12 months to March 2000 puts the area's figure above that of Merseyside. I was a little alarmed when I read that the Quadrant car park in Swansea had been refused the safer car park scheme simply because not enough car crime had been committed there. Local authorities should apply for those schemes so that they can get closed circuit television cameras in place. We should prevent crime now rather than wait. We know that when CCTV is installed, criminals start to look elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider how we are to make our car parks safer, and not just say, "Well, it's not as bad as some other areas, therefore we will not prioritise that particular car park." I support the safer car parks scheme, which was started under the Conservative Administration, and has been carried on by this Government. More CCTV is involved, which was supported broadly by our Government and by this one. We must ensure that local areas are given the support that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not speak for much longer, because I know that many hon. Members want to contribute to the debate. Some local authority estates are very large, and, as I said, it is accepted that some of the families living on them are nuisance families. I suspect that every hon. Member knows, as do some of their constituents, of certain individuals of whom it is said, "If only they weren't living among us, the quality of life for the rest of the people on the estate would improve." I have no doubt about that. When I visited a housing estate in Wales a few weeks ago, a lady from the residents association told me exactly that. She said that two problem families were blighting the lives of everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider legislation to enable people in such communities to have some say in the sort of people who are allowed on to their estates. That must be done in a broad way, to avoid racism or sexism. Why should estates be seen as areas in which to dump problem families? Nobody else will live in certain houses, so the problem families are put there. We should listen more to the decent, law-abiding citizens who have to live on housing estates. They could come up with imaginative schemes to ensure that they are not dogged by nuisance families simply because they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
live on a council estate, or an estate with some council housing. The Government should consider ways of empowering our local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh language was mentioned earlier. We should consider Wales as a whole—as a community within a much larger community. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy distanced himself from certain comments made by members of his party, and I welcome that. However, I would ask his party, in general, to reconsider their comments, because they have caused serious concern among many people living in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that the matter concerns not just the English but people of all sorts of races who have come to Wales, built up businesses, and made a tremendous commitment on a voluntary basis as well. They feel offended by the suggestion of an individual of any party that they are leeching off society or are in some way detracting from the culture of an area. People from elsewhere, whether it is England, Scotland or other parts of the world, have made a tremendous contribution to Welsh communities, and have enriched them. I hope that Plaid Cymru will carefully consider the matter. It says that its members are responsible for their comments, but I understand that Simon Glyn is still chairman of a housing committee, which causes me grave concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been made broader. Initially, we intended to talk more about policing, and we were to be able to question a Home Office Minister, but no Minister was able to attend because of all sorts of diary commitments. I regret that. However, I look forward to my television debates with the Secretary of State during the general election campaign, in which he is now keen to participate, although he did not really show that when I challenged him earlier. I am up for it, and I suspect that members of other parties would also wish to take part in such debates. I only hope that the Secretary of State, unlike his leader, will not back off from debates during the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales will be considering education, the national health service, pensions and public spending in general. We have heard the £16 billion cut, which is complete fantasy, quoted time and time again, and I am sure that Labour Members will carry on producing it. They can carry on, because the people in Wales know the levels of service that they currently receive and those that they were promised four years ago. The Government have not delivered, and the general election is only weeks away. I know that the people of Wales cannot wait to get rid of this dreadful Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones, for calling me so early in this day's debate. I apologise to you and to the Committee for the fact that I shall not attend this afternoon, as I shall be serving on another Standing Committee at 4.30 pm.

I pay tribute to the work of the North Wales police force in my constituency, especially for its raid last week on people involved in the drugs world of Rhyl, north Wales and Merseyside, but generally for its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
record on crime and disorder during the past four and a half years. Crime levels in Wales have fallen by 11.4 per cent., and domestic burglary has fallen by 28.3 per cent. That contrasts sharply with the figures under the previous Conservative Administration, under whom crime doubled between 1992 and 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The improvement in crime levels in Wales has not occurred by accident. It is part of a three-pronged policy that includes police partnerships with local authorities and the voluntary sector, our Government's economic and social policies and the specific extra funding that we have given to police forces across Wales. On the first of those, I am pleased to say that my constituency is blessed with a wide range of voluntary groups—Victim Support, the STARS project and the Cars project in Rhyl, the Women's Aid Federation and many others—involved in anti-crime measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also blessed in that Denbighshire county council is working towards an effective partnership with the police and that the police have adopted the Labour Government's philosophy with zeal. The police have now formalised their partnership with the local authorities and voluntary groups. My constituency has a drug and alcohol forum, a domestic violence and personal safety forum, a town centre and disorder group and a rural crime and community safety group. Those forums have widened the responsibility for tackling crime. They have input into the formulation of policing policy and have helped to bring down crime figures in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for the reduction in crime is the Government's commitment to tackling the underlying causes of crime and disorder, which are poverty and social exclusion. In the past, crime levels have followed economic cycles. They have gone down in booms and up in busts, as we saw throughout the Tory years. The Tories were prepared to say that 3 million people unemployed was a price worth paying. They were prepared to let a generation of young people rot on the dole, left on the margins, and were prepared to accept the financial cost of keeping millions on the dole. That cost the British taxpayer billions of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should be compared to Labour's priority of putting people back to work. For example, the new deal has meant that 70 per cent, of the young people in my constituency are now in work. They have a stake in society, a reason to get up in the morning and a rhythm and pattern to their lives. We have also introduced the minimum wage and the working families tax credit. People will not go to work if they will worsen the position of their families and children by doing so, but we have made work pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most importantly, we have created jobs in Wales. They might not be in the manufacturing, agricultural or tourism sectors, but the overall number of jobs in Wales has gone up by 40,000. In 1986, the dark days of the Tory years, 5,000 people were unemployed in my constituency. That figure is now 1,200, and it is going down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third key to the successful reduction in crime is the funding of the police forces in Wales. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2000-2001V005P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
quoted several sources to suggest that the police forces in Wales were underfunded. I quoted one source—Bill Brereton, the assistant chief constable of the North Wales police—and I would like to refer to another, the former chief constable of north Wales, Michael Argent. He commented on an additional £4.7 million for the North Wales police that was announced last November. The additional funding took the North Wales police budget from £77 million to £82 million. That 6.1 per cent. increase was the third highest in the country, behind Bedfordshire and Kent, and the highest in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To what does the hon. Gentleman attribute the increase in violent crime in Wales today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increase in violent crime has many sources and I shall speak about them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £4.7 million was greeted with pleasure at the fact that the Government had kept their word and the comment was that it was very favourable. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that the money was a one-off payment to pay for 40 extra police officers. It is to fund an extra 104 police officers over three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not sustainable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely sustainable. I am particularly pleased that the extra funding has been ring-fenced for bobbies on the beat. That is what my constituents want: communities policed effectively by officers walking their own patch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 11.2 per cent. drop in crime in Wales is welcome. It has not happened by chance. Crime has fallen because of the Labour Government's deliberate policies: co-operation and a collegiate approach involving local councils and voluntary groups; social and economic policies such as the new deal, the working families tax credit and the minimum wage; and extra funding for the police. All those are threatened by the Opposition. They would certainly be threatened if the Conservatives ever got into power. They can try to shake this fact off, but they are committed to spending cuts of £16 billion. That corresponds to £24 million in my constituency. How would those cuts affect the special projects in my constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's arithmetic. How has he arrived at the figure of £24 million for his constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £24 million derives from the £16 billion that was announced in a Conservative central office press release in July. I urge the hon. Gentleman to dig it out so that he will be better informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Clwyd, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has the wrong constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, whatever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is typical of the concern about north Wales shown by the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter). It is a long way from Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would the £24 million cuts that I mentioned affect special projects in my constituency, such as STARS, an excellent local initiative that should be copied nationally? I shall leave a copy of the relevant document for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. Another project in my constituency, the Cars project, redirects the energies of disaffected youth into more positive activities. Those projects are under threat from the Conservatives. My county, too, is under threat from them. How will it be able to afford the officers' time needed to forge links with the police and the local voluntary sector if annual cuts can be expected, as happened under the previous Conservative Government? How would a £24 million cut affect the 104 extra bobbies that we are putting on the beat in the next three years? Would they be sacked? I will be putting those questions to my constituents in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Antisocial behaviour has been mentioned by many hon. Members. My secretary in the House of Commons, Janet Burgess, who has been here for 37 years, is an Islington councillor. In Islington, antisocial behaviour contracts have been piloted at one twentieth of the cost of antisocial behaviour orders. They are voluntary. They were developed under a Labour administration, before the Liberal Democrats came to power. It does not matter who introduced them. They are effective and should be spread. I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to obtain copies of the relevant material and use his good offices to spread that best practice around Wales. In Islington, 27 of the contracts have been used and only one has been broken in the past two or three years. That excellent record should be replicated in all our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
