	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has had with the First Secretary about health spending in Wales. [121236]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has had with the First Secretary about health spending in Wales. [121242]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regularly meet the First Secretary to discuss matters of importance to Wales and health is often on our agenda. I also often meet with the Health and Social Services Secretary. Following the recent Budget, Wales's share of increased expenditure on health is £99 million for this year and £1,299 million for the next four years. It is for the National Assembly for Wales to decide how to spend the money that it receives, but the Finance Secretary has confirmed that all the extra government money provided by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will go to the national health service in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the unprecedented and huge sum that the NHS in Wales can expect to have in the next few years, will my hon. Friend impress on the Health and Social Services Secretary the need to ensure that the matter of community beds is not forgotten? Cardiff is the least well-provided part of Wales in terms of community beds. Will he work in particular to ensure that there is no undue delay in proceeding with the development of a community hospital on the Cardiff royal infirmary site, which has been promised for many years to the people of Cardiff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is pressing strongly for a community hospital in his constituency and I welcome his efforts. He is a great champion for Cardiff and its health facilities. Additional resources are going to the National Assembly, which will be considering both the capital and the revenue consequences of the resources. I will certainly draw his welcome comments to the attention of Jane Hutt, the Health and Social Services Secretary, when I next meet her. I look forward to the Assembly working in partnership with the Labour Government to deliver health improvements to Cardiff and the rest of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that Dr. Sandra Payne made an announcement recently about the incidence of women dying of breast cancer in north Wales. The percentage rate there is higher than that for the rest of Wales. Is he prepared to use his good offices to discuss the matter with the First Secretary and the Health and Social Services Secretary? He might thereby help to achieve a centre for excellence, which we want in north Wales, providing first-rate cancer treatment and diagnostic facilities to protect women suffering from breast cancer. That centre could work with the new cancer treatment centre opening at Glan Clwyd in June.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), the additional resources that the Government are allowing the Assembly to have, and the Assembly's commitment to preventive health care, means that the Assembly will be considering strongly investing in support for protection from and early diagnosis of breast cancer. I especially welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) on the centre at Glan Clwyd hospital, which serves your constituency, Mr. Jones, and mine. There are additional resources representing real-term rises in funding by the Labour Government to the national health service. In partnership with the Assembly, I will draw my hon. Friend's comments to the attention of the Health and Social Services Secretary because prevention of breast cancer is important to us both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to a welcome injection of money into the health service in Wales. In his discussions with Ministers and the Assembly, will he take into account Welsh health authorities' debt, which amounts to £80 million, and consider the correct balance between paying off the debt and investing in real health improvement? Unfortunately, in Powys, where we have kept the books well, 80 beds in our hospital must still be closed. That does not represent the right balance in the disbursal of the welcome new money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Debt is an important issue when considering the allocation of health resources. The Government are contributing to the partnership by increasing, in real terms, the available resources, and I mean that helpfully. The National Assembly is responsible for allocating those resources. It has a tremendous opportunity to make health differences in Wales. Whether it spends the money on debt or on other services is for it to decide, and I do not want to pre-empt its decisions. However, I remind hon. Members that the Government have given the National Assembly an opportunity to make health improvements during the next few years, the like of which has been given by no other Government—dare I say it—in the past 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams), who expressed concern about breast cancer in north Wales. If my hon. Friend the Minister is taking up the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
matter with the Health and Social Services Secretary, will he extend his talks to cover the incidence of leukaemia in north Wales? Will he use the talks to establish whether there are any hot spots in the region and, if there are such hot spots, to find out why they exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly draw those comments to the attention of Jane Hutt when I next meet her. I know that my hon. Friend has pursued the issue of leukaemia in north Wales since his election to the House and before. The Government understand the importance of his commitment to the prevention of ill health and to early diagnosis and we will discuss these matters with the Health and Social Services Secretary in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Learning and Skills</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What progress has been made in ensuring that the Learning and Skills Bill enables the development of an appropriate youth support service for young people in Wales. [121237]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have today tabled amendments to the Learning and Skills Bill to enable the National Assembly for Wales to develop, together with local authorities and others, an enhanced youth support service for young people in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that news. Does my hon. Friend agree that young people are social animals, which means that we must provide support not only at the level of the individual and the family but at the level of the peer group in the community? Does he agree that, although that peer group can be a creative force for good, it can also be a force for evil, unless adults and institutions take an interest in creating the right environment for young people at the local level? Will he therefore ensure that the clauses that are being inserted into the Learning and Skills Bill take us in the direction of providing wider support for young people as part of a peer group, and not just support at the individual level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend, as the amendments that I tabled today are based largely on work that he undertook when he was a Member of the National Assembly. I appreciate the work that he put in, both as First Secretary and as a member of the Assembly, to draw the clauses together in policy terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clauses is to ensure that we achieve the objectives mentioned by my right hon. Friend. We want the National Assembly to have powers to engage with local authorities so that it can not only participate in the provision of services that tackle great difficulties arising for young people generally but provide the framework to support young people in their peer group in terms of educational and development opportunities and allow them to begin to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
fulfil their full potential. I hope that the new clauses, which hon. Members will study in the next few days, will give the National Assembly strong powers to tackle many issues that relate to young people. I look forward to the debate on them, which will shortly occur in Room 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Longbridge</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has held with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry regarding the possible consequences for the Welsh economy of the closure of Longbridge. [121240]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in continuing contact with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who, together with the First Secretary of the National Assembly, has been keeping me up to date on the latest developments on this issue. Certainly, all wish Phoenix well with its plans for the future of Rover. There remains some uncertainty over the extent of possible reduction of activity at Longbridge and the full consequences for the Welsh economy cannot yet be accurately assessed. Meanwhile, task forces in England and Wales are keeping in close contact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will appreciate that this question was tabled before things were getting a bit better. As he said, there are still uncertainties ahead for Longbridge. Is he aware that the Department of Trade and Industry has said that it will provide £129 million for regional development in the west midlands? In fact, it said that prior to the success of the Phoenix bid. Now that the Phoenix bid has succeeded, and the assessments of unemployment in the west midlands are considerably lower, will my right hon. Friend make representations to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for some of that £129 million to be devoted to the motor component industry in Wales if it can prove a case for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I obviously talked at length to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, both before and after the Longbridge decisions were taken. As for the financial aspect, my right hon. Friend is right to point out that regional selective assistance money, which is under the control of the DTI in England, will be used differently from what was originally intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend may be interested to know that next Tuesday there will be a meeting between the Welsh Automotive Forum task force, Members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Development Agency, the Council of Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils, trade unions and others. I have no doubt that, as well as talking about retraining and other help for the car component industry in Wales, including in my right hon. Friend's constituency of Llanelli and mine, they will be discussing other ways to help. However, I shall definitely talk to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on that specific matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) that a case can be made for the urgent appraisal of the possible loss of manufacturing jobs in the car component industry in Wales. I urge the Secretary of State to consider making such an appraisal and, if necessary, to draw down part of the funds referred to by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those comments. All of us in Wales, whichever seat we represent, have a part to play in decisions that affect our constituencies. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that RSA is a matter for the National Assembly, which will discuss the matter next Tuesday. Outside the west midlands, Wales has the greatest supply chain in the car industry, which is why the problem affects Wales in particular. The good news for Wales is that the future of Ford in Bridgend is now secure. Indeed, it may get more work. However, I do not underestimate the difficulties that already face manufacturing industry in Wales. We shall obviously keep closely in touch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will be aware that UK Safety Group Ltd. in my constituency, which produces footwear for the military, has announced its closure with the loss of 65 jobs. Is he concerned that the reason for the closure is the company's decision to outsource its contracts with the Ministry of Defence to companies in Brazil because wage costs are far lower there? I have been told that they are about one sixth of the wages paid in the United Kingdom. Surely, that cannot be right. If we can accept the logic of that argument, the only way in which companies in communities such as mine can retain defence contracts is by agreeing to work for a bowl of rice a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's concern. He knows that I have a considerable interest in his constituency, as I worked there for many years. I also know that he is meeting Defence Ministers tomorrow. I shall be in contact with the Ministry to discuss those issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the DTI about financial allocation to Wales to cover the effects of the withdrawal of BMW from car production at Longbridge. [121241]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in continuing contact with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who has been keeping me up to date on the latest developments. As I said, the allocation of financial support for Welsh industry is a matter for the Assembly, and the DTI package is a reallocation of existing resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend reassure those members of the work force in my constituency who are about to lose their jobs in Aeroquip in Llamshen and Alloyd Wheels in Whitchurch that retraining will be available? Many of them have been employed in those factories for more than 20 years. Will he give an assurance about money for retraining
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
those members of the work force who have been employed in both factories, many for more than 20 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained to my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), next week there will be an important meeting in Cardiff to discuss those matters. The discussions will cover money for regional selective assistance and for training and retraining of people who have lost their jobs as a consequence of the latest developments. I know that my hon. Friend's constituency has been affected badly by those decisions, but she may rest assured that those matters are at the front of my mind and that of the First Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Hyder Takeover</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>7. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the First Secretary of the National Assembly about the impact on the supply of water, the upgrading of sewage outfalls to sea, and the levels of employment in the water industry arising from the takeover bids for Hyder plc. [121243]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regularly meet the First Secretary, and have discussed the takeover bids for Hyder. These are primarily matters for the company to consider, with any proposed bids being closely scrutinised by Ofwat and Ofgem. My office and the National Assembly for Wales will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happened to the limit on the shareholding to which any one person was entitled? The limit of 15 per cent. was announced by the then Secretary of State for Wales, Peter Walker, in January 1989. If that limit was dropped, were Members of the House and the Committee told about it? Will the right hon. Gentleman also tell the Committee how he intends to use his powers under the Water Act 1989, which have not been transferred to the National Assembly, to safeguard water consumers, water workers and the environment in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly examine those issues. To be perfectly honest, I was not aware that the powers to which he referred were vested in my office. I shall have to check that with the lawyers because most of the executive functions held by the previous Secretary of State were transferred either to the National Assembly or elsewhere.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received no specific representations since the farming summit, but was pleased to note the welcome given by farming leaders to the package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely amazed by that answer. It surprises me that my right hon. Friend has received no responses, because the package has been widely welcomed. As he may know, there was an annual agriculture debate in the House last week, at which Mr. Ben Gill was present. He said that it is a considerable package, which goes a long way to demonstrating that the Government have a strong strategy for farming in Wales. Having said that, I want to draw my right hon. Friend's attention to the plight of dairy farmers, many of whom find their position unsustainable. Is he satisfied that enough is being done to promote the consumption of fresh milk, especially in schools? I am sure that he would agree that milk is an excellent product. Unlike some other products that children consume, it does not turn them yellow, it does not rot their teeth, it promotes healthy growth and it builds up calcium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A shorter reply, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is universal agreement that milk is good for one. As for the dairy sector, my hon. Friend knows that there is legislation to remove dairy hygiene inspection charges. The package was a considerable help to dairy farmers. I recently discussed the issue with the National Farmers Union, which is worried about how supermarkets sell milk. It is rightly anxious that a reasonable and sensible amount of the cost is retained. The representations are on-going. I share my hon. Friend's concern for dairy farmers and agree that farming unions in Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom welcomed the farming summit. There were no representations because they went to the Assembly's Secretary for Agriculture and Rural Development and to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State none the less accept that many farmers who welcomed the summit were disappointed with the money that they derived from it? Does he agree that the main problems for farmers are the strength of the pound and the need to have a level playing field across Europe? Will he assure us that he will continue to lobby the Treasury for money and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for support to ensure that those two problems are solved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bob Parry of the Farmers Union of Wales said that the aid was more than he expected. Hugh Richards of the NFU Cymru said:
	<br><blockquote><p>I certainly welcome the package, it was much better than I thought.</p></blockquote>
Those strike me as good responses to the package. In addition, £10.6 million of agrimonetary compensation was paid to dairy, beef and sheep farmers in Wales. That largely covers the hon. Gentleman's point about the strength of the pound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was there any discussion about the high pound, which concerns all parties? Is there a co-ordinated campaign in the Cabinet to talk down the value of the pound? Last Tuesday, the Chancellor talked about the value of the pound and how the euro was not in line with economic fundamentals. Last Wednesday, the Prime Minister used for the first time the terms the high pound and the weak euro. Is the Minister part of that campaign? Does he agree that we want the euro's value to rise by 20 or 30 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to concentrate on the relative weakness of the euro. He is also right about the farming summit. The amount of agrimonetary compensation that was paid to Welsh and British farmers in general was in recognition of the strength of sterling. The support package was in addition to the £88 million of agrimoney that was paid to United Kingdom farmers. Another £44 million will follow next year if exchange rates stay the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking to the farming industry's future, and following the comments on the strong pound, the headline rate of inflation was up 0.4 per cent. to 3 per cent. this morning, and there is likely to be a rise in interest rates, which will affect farming families, especially those in debt. Will the Secretary of State use his influence in Cabinet to persuade the Treasury to make it a responsibility of the Bank of England to have job creation as an aim of economic policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman also knows that the underlying rate of inflation dropped this morning.

In his discussions with the First Secretary, will my hon. Friend stress the need for greater protection for areas of outstanding natural beauty in Wales, including the Wye valley in my constituency?

	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The devolution White Paper "A Voice for Wales" proposed that the financial arrangements for the Assembly would largely replicate the existing system, and that changes to the size of the Welsh block would largely be determined by the Barnett formula.

"The Statement of Funding Policy" published by the Treasury in March 1999 confirmed that, and explained how the Barnett formula operates.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for that comprehensive reply. I note that, because it is a sensitive subject, there was considerable detail in it. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that, during the 18 years of Conservative rule, gross domestic product in Wales fell by 10 per cent? Wales is now out of line with the Barnett formula. The average in Scotland is around 98 per cent., while it is around 86 per cent., as I recall, in Wales. Is it not time that the Barnett formula was re-negotiated because, as we know from the needs of the Assembly and from match funding for European structural funds under objective 1 and 2, it is difficult to find sufficient money in the Welsh block to progress with schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last point, my right hon.

The dangers and difficulties of having a spending review, given that people knew what the funding arrangements would be when they went to the referendum, mean that it is not as simple as he might make out.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Welsh economy.</p></blockquote>
Every member of the Committee, from whatever party, is vitally interested in the Welsh economy, in both our rural and urban areas. As we saw during question time, everyone is right to be concerned about the future of our manufacturing industry, including cars and steel, to which I will refer in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, I must note that it is important that none of us who holds a position in public life in Wales talks the country down or sends the message to the world that the Welsh economy is in serious difficulties when it is not. Across the world, Britain is seen as
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
having a strong and growing economy. That strength is one of the reasons why the pound is so highly valued against the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening so soon, but I wish to pick up on a point made by my right hon. Friend about the success of the Welsh economy. Was that strength not confirmed last week by the opening of the Dow Corning's Genesis plant in Barry? It is the biggest investment of its kind in the world, making Barry the biggest producer of raw silicon in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I opened the plant, so it was important. I will refer to Dow Corning later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) said recently:
	<br><blockquote><p>We have to get used to the idea that a strong currency is not a bad thing. It is a reflection of a strong economy.</p></blockquote>
Wales is part of that strong and growing economy. It might be starting from a lower base than other parts of Britain but it is nevertheless benefiting from the platform of stability that the Government have brought to our country. That is why there are thousands more people in jobs in Wales and why the average earnings of those in full-time work has risen by 9 per cent. in real terms. That is also why more of those in work in Wales are working full time than was the case under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily admit that that is only the start—we have done a lot but there is much more to do. That is why we have five basic goals as part of our long-term strategy for the economy in the United Kingdom and in Wales. We have a goal for increasing prosperity and a faster rise in productivity than our competitors as we close the productivity gap. We have a goal for full employment, employment opportunity for all and a higher percentage of people in work than ever before in Wales, largely thanks to the introduction of the new deal. We have a goal for education and educational opportunities for all. We aim to ensure that 50 per cent. of people go into higher education for the first time in the history of this country, and want to get as close as possible to ensuring that 100 per cent. of young people have skills in computing. We have a goal to defeat poverty and to ensure that every child has the best start in life, as we halve child poverty in 10 years and end it completely in 20 years. We have a goal for public services: we want to invest for the future in strong public services that will be available when people need them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget was a key part of that strategy. It was further proof of the Government's commitment both to social justice and to economic enterprise. Above all, it showed that our fiscal prudence could and would deliver for the priorities of the hard-working people of Britain and Wales. The Budget delivered more money for the health service—its biggest ever cash boost—and more money for education, as part of the largest sustained increase in investment in education ever seen in Britain. It also gave the National Assembly more money to improve Wales' vital transport links—the infrastructure that underpins our economic growth. Yes, we could always have spent more, but if we had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
followed the advice of some of our political opponents, we would now have borrowed and spent our way into economic oblivion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned the increases in expenditure on health, transport and education that he foresaw from the Government's recent statement. Although that may be true for 2000–01, or the present year, does he accept that if we are to maintain the level of increase in health that the Government seek in Wales, there will be no money at all for 2001–02 and subsequently nothing for education or transport by way of additional expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows about the spending review, which is the basis on which spending will operate for the next few years. The only public service that the Chancellor said would be outside that review in terms of the announcement of the amount to be provided between now and 2003–04 was the health service. The increase in the health service in Wales over those years will be £1.2 billion, which is the biggest increase in health service expenditure since its creation by Aneurin Bevan 50 years ago. We cannot comment yet on education and transport, which are still part of the comprehensive spending review, so the details on them will not emerge until the review is over. I guess that the Assembly Finance Secretary was referring to the overall percentage terms of expenditure increases that were announced in the Budget. Specific increases within individual education and transport budgets are still to be agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been able to boost public finances now only because we were so prudent before. Paying off public debt is part of that, as is getting right the balance between taxation and public spending. We are getting the balance right; we are making work pay and using the tax and benefit system, as we have done with the working families tax credit, to banish child poverty and to get Wales into work. I know that people who are already in jobs have expressed valid concerns about the impact of the relative weakness of the euro, and thus, of course, the relative strength of sterling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those problems do not just affect Wales. The Committee needs reminding, for example, that it is south-east England that has the greatest concentrations of engineering companies in the United Kingdom—it has almost five times as many as Wales and marginally more than the west midlands, the traditional home of engineering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to south-east England. He will know that Ford has announced that it will stop manufacturing cars in Dagenham.

manufacturing and the steel industry, which I shall deal with later. However, with regard to retaining engine production in the United Kingdom, in particular at the Bridgend facility, that is, ironically, good news for Wales. What makes me a socialist is that I am as concerned about working people in Slough as I am about working people in Swansea. The impact in the UK of trends in the global economy affects us all. We have a responsibility as mems of the UK Government for the whole of the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that as a compliment, Mr. Jones. Indeed, I rise to speak about socialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Secretary of State meets the First Secretary, will he ask him whether he still believes in the fine socialist principle that investment should go where the need is greatest? If he does still believe in it, will he explain to people in the valley communities of my constituency, which are some of the poorest areas in the UK, why they are not given the same priority when it comes to allocating objective 1 money as smaller, less poor rural villages in other parts of Wales? A statement from the First Secretary, who refused to respond to such criticism yesterday, would be appreciated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that the details to which he refers are matters for the National Assembly, but I shall of course raise his concerns when I meet the First Secretary next week. Neither of us doubts the socialist credentials of the First Secretary, and I certainly do not doubt the socialist credentials of my hon. Friend, with whom I have been discussing the relative merits of aspects of democratic socialism for 25 years.

The Government govern all of Britain. We face problems together. However, let us put matters into perspective. Last week's manufacturing figures showed the March output of the UK metals industry to be at its highest for 17 months. Manufacturing output in general was 1.6 per cent. higher in the first quarter of 2000 than it was in the first quarter of 1999. The figures show that the manufacturing industry is far from being in decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is painting too rosy a picture of what is happening. He said that the Government govern the whole of Britain, but 206,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 1997. We heard that the textile industry is in crisis. Some 65 jobs have been lost in Blaenau Gwent and production at another shoe factory has been suspended in Pembrokeshire.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and here are some chestnuts for the hon. Gentleman. The world's manufacturing industry is being reshaped by new technology. Manufacturing employment in the UK since the Labour Government came into office just over three years ago is down by 160,000. We accept the need to retrain, reskill and redirect people, but when the hon. Gentleman's Government were in office between 1979 and 1999, 140,000 people left manufacturing every year for 20 years. That is the reality and the difference between what his Government failed to do and what we are doing for the manufacturing industry. He is right to refer to the difficulties experienced by people who face redundancy. All the hon. Members here represent people who have at some point felt the impact of redundancies. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) should consider some of the successes that we have seen in Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) referred, for example, to the Dow Corning investment of £200 million, the biggest investment that company has made anywhere in the world, with 200 extra jobs created in the Vale of Glamorgan. Airbus, in your constituency, Mr. Jones, is a huge Welsh success story. Yesterday, I visited Manweb in Wrexham, an excellent manufacturing company. Extra investment is being made in the car industry, at Vauxhall, and, in my constituency in the car component company TRW. £1.3 million is being invested over the next two years in an industry that is linked to the car industry. There are many other examples of manufacturing success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be wrong of me to comment on the way regional selective assistance is distributed by the Welsh Assembly. That is not what devolution is about. That is the Assembly's business. All I can say is that the Government have decided to help the industry with a loan of over £500 million to Airbus. That is a huge indication of the Government's commitment to the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is great concern about the fact that the Welsh Assembly has not yet given any commitment to the £25 million or £26 million that is needed for the project to be completed. What encouragement has he given the First Secretary to ensure that that funding is given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I have discussed the matter with the First Secretary. I understand that the First Secretary has had meetings with the management and the unions at Broughton. The encouragement I have given the industry is a loan of £500 million from the United Kingdom Government, which is a good encouragement.

The euro's weakness does cause problems, particularly for industries such as steel, where our workers add considerable value to the product. However, there are no short-term solutions. In 1992, the Conservatives were forced into a massive devaluation, but the value of sterling still rose. Sterling is only a few percentage points higher today than it was when the previous Government left office. The valuation of the euro in the long term needs to be addressed, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry mentioned last week in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor, the Prime Minister and other Ministers do not have a magic wand with which to make the euro rise. Only a fool would suggest that there is some instant fix, which will solve all these problems without risking inflation or a return to the Conservative years of boom and bust. In the era of globalisation and with intensive competition from all parts of the globe, Governments cannot guarantee the future of any industry for all time. However, Governments can do something that we consider important; they can give the people who work in manufacturing and across the economy generally the skills and training they need to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise in today's economy. In short, we have to learn to compete. The Government recognise that. Therefore, we are piloting the Learning and Skills Bill through the House and are pressing the European Union to put the information economy and e-commerce at the heart of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emphasis on training is at the heart of the new deal, which, despite the complaints of many parties who disagree with us, has so far assisted over 13,000 people in Wales to come off the dole queue and into work. We have helped small and medium-sized businesses. Last week, the 	<i>Western Mail</i> put on a successful exhibition in Cardiff, which showed how small and medium-sized businesses in Wales now account for many hundreds of thousands of jobs. They, too, have been helped by reductions in capital gains tax and corporation tax, as well as in other ways. I want to refer to two industries: the car industry and the steel industry. We are aware that the car component industry is important to Wales, not least in my constituency, where almost 5,000 people are employed in that industry. As I have already said, Phoenix will deal with mass volume car manufacturing, and that will stay at Longbridge. Change there needs to be managed, but the Welsh automotive task force will meet next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is aware of the importance of the steel industry to Wales as an employer. About 10,000 people in Wales work in the steel industry and many thousands more work as contractors or in industries and businesses linked to the steel industry. There is hardly any Committee member with a constituency in south Wales or parts of north-east Wales—especially in Shotton in your constituency, Mr. Jones—who does not have an interest in the steel industry. My constituency has traditionally been a steel industry. Members of my family were employed as steel workers and, in the middle of my constituency, there is still a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
steel works that produces first-class stainless steel. In the 1960s and 1970s, when Cwmbran was being developed, many thousands of people moved from Llanelli and other parts of Wales to Cwmbran to work in Llanwern. Therefore, I have a personal interest, as well as a constituency interest, in what happens to the steel industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The steel industry is experiencing difficulties at the moment because of the problems associated with the strength of sterling. I have met, and will meet again next week, the chief executive of Corus, who happens to be from Pontypool. I have already met trade union representatives, and the First Secretary will meet representatives of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation in the next week or two. They say that problems have arisen from the strength of sterling and the weakness of the euro, together with other difficulties in obtaining customers from manufacturing industry in the United Kingdom, who have themselves been affected. However, we should not exaggerate that. Earlier, I mentioned Dagenham, and have since been given fresh advice that Corus does not believe that it will be affected in the short term by the closure of Ford at Dagenham. That is good news, hot from the press, which answers the questions asked by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, Corus recently won a new order from Turkey, and I believe that the news about Longbridge will have great significance for the steel industry. The reduction in some car industries will be offset by increased demands from other car companies, such as Honda, Toyota and Nissan, all of which are expected to add some 300,000 to UK production figures by the year 2005, which is a 50 per cent. increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the strength of sterling, but it is important for all of us, as public representatives, to work with the trade unions and with Corus to ensure that we tell the world the good news about the company. Llanwern is still one of the finest strip mills in the whole world, Port Talbot has historically been one of the greatest steel works in the world, there are good news stories to tell about Ebbw Vale and Shotton and we still have the best steel makers in the world. That is why it is so important for us to work closely with their representatives, as I and my colleagues do, to see what will happen in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my late arrival, which meant that I was unable to ask the question that I had tabled. The sole reason for that was the extraordinary number of vehicles on the M4, many of which, I am sure, were manufactured from Welsh steel. It is a sign of the prosperity of the steel industry that 45 per cent. of the steel that is currently manufactured in Britain is manufactured in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what my right hon. Friend said about the brilliant success story of Welsh steel, which has been transformed in recent years without subsidies. Its record has also recently been magnificent. There is a certain amount of irritation among steel workers-of whom Newport has rather more than Brecon and Radnor-about the way in which certain opportunist
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
politicians use the steel industry to make cheap political propaganda. It is not true and it is not welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend worked at Llanwern and represents many thousands of people in Newport who rely on the success of that plant for their livelihoods. I repeat that Llanwern is one of most efficient and productive plants in the United Kingdom; it is also the most modern and streamlined plant in the whole of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that hon. Members who raise the issue of the future of the steel industry in Wales do so because of the direct representations that we have received from executives of Corus? Members of all parties in the National Assembly were invited to Margam a week last Thursday and told in stark terms of the company's concerns. As the Secretary of State said, the company has a good record in improving productivity and technology, and its work force has done brilliantly. The company has a high-capacity utilisation, but if it is selling all that steel without making sufficient margin to pay the fixed overheads and to generate adequate profits, it can be undermined, despite its track record. What can the Government do to help such a good company in such a dire position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is important to respond to representations that are made to us as Members of Parliament and to other public representatives. It is right for us to be concerned about the impact of the strength of the pound and the weakness of the euro. The company has, however, made it completely clear that no decisions have been taken about any plant in Wales or anywhere else. It is still considering the future plans that it will adopt as a result of its merger, which occurred some time ago. The company and the ISTC tell me that speculation about the future of particular plants has no merit. Members of the ISTC who are working in the company are committed to making it a success, as all of us want it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman knows that, under European legislation on the European Coal and Steel Community, we could not intervene even if we wanted to through direct subsidy to the steel industry. That is not allowed under the rules. It is right for us to be intimately, directly and properly involved with all of those who run the steel industry. For example, ISTC leaders recently met the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The chief executives-of whom there are two, one Dutch and one British-recently met the Secretary for Trade. I have already met those leading figures, and will do so again with the First Secretary very soon. We will do all that we can to ensure that the importance of the steel industry for Wales and the rest of the economy is recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the overall situation in respect of the strength of sterling, the Prime Minister has made it abundantly clear that we must think in the long term and that we cannot have a simple quick-fix solution. If we try to produce such a solution, we will be back to the bad old days of boom and bust. The horrors of high inflation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
would have an enormously adverse effect on manufacturing industry, not to mention on everybody whom we represent in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Secretary of State's comments on the strength sterling and the weakness of euro, and having accepted that there is no quick fix, does he agree that the Government are pussyfooting around the question of joining the euro, and that a more proactive stance would provide a more certain future for industries such as Corus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government's policy is clear: we will enter the euro on the basis of the result of a referendum. I should point out that his Assembly colleague, Janet Davies, who spoke during a statement on the Llanwern steel works, does not agree with him. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>A strong currency is not only an economic decision, it is also a political one.</p></blockquote>
That is correct. She continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>A decision was made not to sign up to the euro, and I do not blame your Government for this. The pound is certainly too strong for us to successfully sign up to the euro.</p></blockquote>
Everyone will agree that, before entering the euro, we must take the long-term view and abide by our manifesto commitment to a vote on the question of entry. In the meantime, we are preparing for possible entry and have laid down the strict conditions that would first have to be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of the steel industry's and other industries' need for extra custom and new markets. Productivity in the steel industry has increased tremendously, and I believe that the great skills that our steelworkers and managers possess will benefit our economy in the coming period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of his analysis of the steel industry, does my right hon. Friend agree that we should consider manufacturing plans for Port Talbot and Llanwern not in the short term, but over 10, 20 or 30 years? It is important that we join the euro at a sustainable rate—probably a rate far higher than its present low value. Is it not the Labour Government's ambition to join at a realistic level in the next five or 10 years? Only then can the steel industry under Corus prosper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made some valid remarks. His constituency is in what was the heartlands of the Welsh tin-plate industry, until the steel industry moved to Port Talbot and Llanwern. As I have said, skills will not be lost as a result of a quick decision. It is important to consider the matter in the long term, including our possible membership of the euro and the exchange rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also emphasise why this Government fought long and hard to secure objective 1 status for west Wales and the valleys. Objective 1 will be a success. It was won by Labour in Berlin, and it will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
delivered by Labour in Cardiff. Objective 1 is an opportunity for Wales, but it will succeed only if Cardiff and London work together in partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would a Conservative Administration mean to the Welsh economy? Speaking in the House in February, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury made a commitment to the end of objective 1 status. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Instead of scrabbling around trying to increase the level of handouts from the EU budget for those regions, why do not the Government tackle the real issue, which is that for every £2 we pay into the EU budget we get £1 back? [	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 February 2000; Vol. 345, col. 745.]</p></blockquote>
A Conservative Administration might also mean the end of the new deal or the working families tax credit, which was attacked in the House a few days ago by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning). She spoke of
	<br><blockquote><p>ill-thought-through schemes such as the working families tax credit. [	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 2000, Vol. 349, c. 1004.]</p></blockquote>
Wales might also be driven backwards by the undermining of the health service and the welfare state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State seems to be reaching the conclusion of his speech, but he has said nothing about the rural economy. That is typical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would understand, I am sure, that obtaining objective 1 status is as important to the rural economy as the urban economy. Increases in the national health service affect not only the valleys and cities, but the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal, which was introduced by the Labour Government, has been hugely successful in rural parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the nature of the current debate on the Welsh economy, it is important concentrate on the industrial manufacturing sector. That is why I spent some time talking about the steel and car industries. That does not mean that we are uninterested in other sectors. People sometimes try to divide the Welsh economy into watertight compartments for the purposes of arguing that because one lives in a rural area, or an urban area, the general economic benefits that I have described do not have an effect. That is an artificial distinction; of course they have an effect. Everything that I have said, apart from the references to the manufacturing industry, is as important to the hon. Gentleman's constituency as it is to mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the vast attention that we have given to the rural economy, is it not appropriate to concentrate on the contribution that it makes to the Welsh gross domestic product? It used to be said, rightly, that it contributed 2 per cent. However, if one subtracts the subsidies that it receives, it contributes 0.1 per cent. That means that 99.9 per cent. of agriculture's contribution to the Welsh economy is in fact subsidy—most of it from the common agricultural policy. By emphasising the help that we get from Europe, and—at last—giving attention to its contribution to the economy of Wales, my hon. Friend the Secretary of State has got the balance right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows as well as I do—because of the nature of his constituency—that many Welsh constituencies are mixed. Many of us represent what might traditionally be regarded as urban constituencies, but in which there are many farmers. That is the case throughout Wales. Of course, some hon. Members' constituencies, such as that of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), are overwhelmingly rural, and I understand that they therefore have an interest in dealing with rural matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose today was to talk about the Welsh economy in general, which applies to all parts of Wales. I chose specifically to home in on the steel and car industries because they are current issues that are alive in Wales. They are also very much alive in the Assembly, which is why, a few days ago, the First Secretary made a statement about Llanwern steelworks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State recognise that those of us who represent predominantly rural constituencies do not seek an exclusive focus on the countryside, but a balance between urban and rural constituencies? If the strategy that he describes is consistent with that, we shall welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know when, during the next year or so, the general election will take place, but, when it does, there will be a clear choice between a Tory Government who are determined to take us back to the bad old days and a Labour Government who will continue the policies that have given us, over the past few years, thousands of jobs, low inflation and low interest rates and who will continue to work with the Assembly to deliver objective 1 and to work hard for the hard-working people of Wales, wherever they live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Secretary of State's speech with considerable interest. The intervention by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will be heard loud and clear in many parts of rural Wales, and may haunt the Government at the next general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to see the return of a Conservative Government. However, if the Labour Government are re-elected, I should like them to develop some more radical policies that can address the social, as well as the economic problems that face our country. The Wales that I try to serve, in various capacities, faces several problems that the Secretary of State only touched on in his speech. I understand that he has to put a positive gloss and spin on what is happening, and accept that the Government have had some successes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to a few later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The steel industry and other large parts of manufacturing industry are being hit hard by the strength of the pound against the euro. It also hits agriculture and its associated industries and tourism—
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
another industry about which we have not heard much today, and which employs about 100,000 people in Wales. There are, therefore, areas of considerable concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach this debate through the perspective of the National Assembly. It would be appropriate to clarify the relationships between the responsibilities that fall to the Assembly and those that fall to central Government in relation to the economy. Broad economic policy is clearly a function that remains in London. That is where decisions are made on matters such as interest rates, the parity of the pound, taxation and expenditure policies, industrial and company legislation, and on the United Kingdom's input into the European Council of Ministers on issues such as agriculture. London is also where the future of the Barnett formula on resource distribution is determined, which has massive importance for Wales, and where decisions will be taken on the comprehensive spending review in July. That, too, will have a significant bearing on the economy of Wales and on the delivery of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government in Cardiff have a specific role. The National Assembly lays down guidelines for key agencies such as the Welsh Development Agency. It also decides the spending priorities within the £8 billion block, and is responsible for drawing up the new training strategy under the e-tech reports, which is critical to industry. The Labour Government in Wales are responsible for submitting to the European Union the objective 1 bid. It was submitted in its final form yesterday, and I hope that this one sticks and delivers the goods. We look forward to hearing about that as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance of the economy in Wales depends on three parameters: on policies determined in Brussels for Europe as a whole; on policies determined in London on a broad economic strategy for the United Kingdom; and on policies determined in Cardiff relating to the interpretation of policy in Wales. It is important that all three tiers of government work in harmony and pull together to achieve substantial economic progress. Members of all political parties want to see that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first entered the House of Commons many years ago, it was against a background of the Welsh economy having three very sturdy legs: coal, steel and agriculture. They were the three important prongs of the economy. In 1970, the coal industry employed about 100,000 people in Wales, the steel industry about 60,000 and agriculture about 40,000. That made a total of about 200,000 people in those sectors—probably 300,000 if one takes into account the multiplier effect. Today, the coal industry is reduced to employing a couple of thousand people as a direct result of Government policy during the Thatcher era.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agriculture is going through an immense crisis in Wales, as in the rest of the United Kingdom. We shall be lucky if 25 per cent. of those currently in farming are in full-time agriculture in five years' time. The steel industry, as we have already heard today, is facing considerable difficulties. I shall return to that issue in a moment. The basic fabric of our economy is going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
through a process of considerable change. The question is whether the jobs that are being lost through the rundown of those industries can be replaced by sustainable jobs of quality that have a long-term future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The collapse of the central planks of the Welsh economy has inevitable consequences. The income per head in Wales has dropped from 92 per cent. of the United Kingdom average in 1964 to 82 per cent. today. The average figures hide much more than they reveal. The GDP per head in certain parts of west Wales and the valleys, and parts of north-west Wales and south-west Wales—indeed, 15 of the 22 counties—is less than 75 per cent. of the European average. That is why we are getting objective 1 status. It is not a matter of pride that we are getting that status. It is a matter of immense sadness that a country that was once a powerhouse of industrial Europe now ranks among Europe's paupers and brings us into that category. I am glad that we are to get the resources to tackle those problems, but I am saddened that we are in a predicament in which we need that help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the decrease in the GDP in Wales over a long period. However, if he takes the shorter period from May 1997, when Labour Government were elected, he will see that the average wage level at that time was £275. Will he acknowledge that there has been a £79 a week increase in the average wage since Labour took office—an increase of 21 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Labour came to power in April 1997, the average wage in Wales was £330 a week and the United Kingdom average was £367, so Wales was on average £37 a week below the UK figure. By April 1999 the average in Wales had increased to £353 and the UK average was up to £400, so we were £47 behind. The hon. Gentleman is right that there has been an increase, but the gap has widened. We dropped further behind the UK average over that period. I am glad to be able to give him the precise figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman quote the source of his figures, as I seriously challenge their accuracy? As we are hurling statistics back and forth, I shall quote from the Secretary of State's earlier speech, in which he said that living standards in Wales had improved by 9 per cent. over the past three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what date the hon. Gentleman is referring to with his percentage increase, but my figure was from the House of Commons Library. We can certainly explore the sources of figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way so that I can put my sources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, by all means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was remiss of me not to do so. My source was the new earnings survey, which is next updated in October 2000. It is a real increase of 21 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether there is a difference in what we are arguing. I accept that there has been an increase in Wales, but the gap between the Wales and the UK average has also widened. That is one of the problems that we face. It is because of the gap between the average in Wales and the European average, which can be seen in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, that we are entitled to objective 1 status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cumulative effect of successive Government policies is that our income per head is below the UK and European averages, and those policies have failed to close the gap. If it continues to open, it will affect our economy, our standard of living and our ability to retain young people and people of ability working in Wales. That is something that concerns us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look in detail at what is happening in the Welsh economy today. I have given the figures for average wage levels. The most recent Government figures for unemployment show 58,700 people in Wales claiming jobseeker's allowance—4.8 per cent.—but we know that unemployment figures have been a matter of considerable controversy over the years and that there are different ways of defining unemployment. For example, the International Labour Organisation definition puts the number of unemployed in Wales at 101,000 at present, or 7.6 per cent., and the labour market slack analysis, which is the largest analysis of unemployment, puts the number of people in Wales who need work and could benefit from having work at 257,000. That is a maximum figure, which includes 17 per cent. for women working at home who may want to return to work in due course. That shows the capacity for new jobs in Wales and pinpoints the challenge for Government, whether in London or Cardiff, to meet that need. Another problem is that the number of company start-ups is not as high as we would wish, and attention must be paid to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned agriculture, and if my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy catches your eye, Mr. Jones, will say more about the agricultural dimension, but it is worth highlighting the recent immense difficulties in the dairy sector. Net farm income per hectare in the dairy sector dropped from £137 in 1995–96 to £87 in 1997–98, and over the past two years has dropped even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing has been hit by the crisis in the motor industry, which we heard about a moment ago. In doing an analysis, I was surprised to find that 52 plants in Wales are manufacturing components or vehicles for the motor industry, employing over 15,000 people. That is clearly a significant sector. Therefore, any problems in the motor industry are bound to have a knock-on effect on those companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman regret his comments at the Tally-ho rally in Cardiff, where he compared, unfavourably, the plight of redundant Welsh miners and steelworkers to that of farmers?

While it is true that Welsh tenant farmers are at a disadvantage, surely he should compare them to other farmers in Wales, where the price of land has increased rather than decreased? Should not he be campaigning for a fairer distribution of subsidies? Eighty per cent. of subsidies are still going to the richest 20 per cent. of farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the last point. I would like to see subsidies being used more effectively for those most in need and for small family farms, rather than going to the big barons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us will have seen the film on television last night, showing the plight of tenant farmers in Wales-and, indeed, in parts of England, such as Cornwall. It showed how they are in danger of losing not only their livelihood, but their home. There is no redundancy payment for tenant farmers. Many families face a desperate situation, and I know that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is real hardship for tenant farmers in Wales, with the same compassion and sympathy that he would, rightly, have for a coal miner or steelworker facing such problems.

The problems in the steel industry have been mentioned. I had a meeting with Corus executives 12 days ago. It was attended by Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory Members of the National Assembly, who gave a graphic warning of the danger to the steel industry in Wales, if there was no change of course. Corus directly employs over 11,000 people in Wales, but future viability is threatened by the high value of the pound against the euro. Corus exports a large proportion of its output to continental Europe, and the home market is susceptible to import substitution. Corus gave us figures that the Committee should consider: every 10-pfennig drop in the value of the deutschmark against the pound costs the United Kingdom steel industry £100 million a year. As we know, the drop has been 40 pfennig. No industry can absorb costs of that kind, without dire consequences. The industry is selling its steel, but at what price? The industry has a high throughput, necessary to absorb fixed overheads, but it is not sufficient to ensure the viability of the plants in the long term. At that meeting, the director of Corus asked us
	<br><blockquote><p>Do the UK Government want us, as a company, to remain in Britain making steel?</p></blockquote>
Those were his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to run scare stories. The record of workers in places such as Llanwern, Port Talbot and other centres is exemplary. They deserve to succeed and to have a future, but they need the Government's help. The parity of the currency is an important element in guaranteeing their future. We are heading towards a cliff, and we will go over it, if we continue on our current course—only a stupid person would do that. We should look for a change in policy to ensure that an industry as important as the steel industry is safeguarded for the future and that the employees get the job security that they deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is unanimity across political parties, manufacturing industry and agriculture about the serious difficulties caused by the

high pound and the low euro. The right hon. Gentleman asks the Government to act. What, specifically, can the Government do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be coming to that in a moment.

Clearly, there is a problem with the low value of the euro, but it is not everything, in terms of the stability of the economy. For instance, when Matsui decided to relocate its European headquarters to west Wales—a major triumph—the president was asked by the BBC's industrial correspondent, who has the capacity to bring a slight air of depression to any good news, whether he was worried by the strength of the pound. His answer was that Matsui had looked at not only the level of exchange, but the long-term strength of the economy, and that it was coming here with confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Of course, more than one factor will be considered by anyone investing in Wales, whether they are from Japan or anywhere else in the world. We welcome people who wish to invest. However, one consideration for companies that will be exporting to euro-land must be the policy relating to the strength of the pound. Different companies will have different levels of exports to that market. Those with high levels of such exports facing competition from plants within euro-land will face more serious problems than companies exporting mainly, for example, to the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman mentioned the value of the pound in relation to the possibility of his party being in government in Cardiff. I thought that during and since the election campaign for the Welsh Assembly, he had unequivocally declared that it was not the policy of his party to be the Government of an independent Wales that could manage exchange rates. Will the right hon. Gentleman clarify that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we want to be in government in Cardiff. We do not anticipate that we shall have control over the exchange rates when we form that Government in 2003. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I should like to return to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's policy. I shall be more than happy to debate the constitution of Wales whenever you feel that it is appropriate, Mr. Jones. I believe that the National Assembly for Wales needs greater powers, and that it should have the same powers as the Scottish Parliament to enact legislation. We shall be happy to stand at the general election on that basis. However, that is not the subject of our debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to answer the question raised by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr, before he has the chance to intervene again. The Chancellor has to change direction before it is too late. He must give new instructions to the Bank of England to consider the effect of its policies on not only inflation, which I accept is an important element, but employment, which is equally important. Just as the bank in the United States takes into consideration inflation and employment as joint criteria for its policies, so should the Bank of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to engineer a downward movement for the pound—perhaps a 2 per cent. drop in the base rate. I accept that that would create inflationary pressures, but those pressures should be tackled by the taxation system rather than by interest rates, which is the single strategy used by the Bank of England. The interest rate policy leads to a high pound. We need a fall of between 15 and 20 per cent. in the value of sterling. When that has been secured, we should go into the euro with no messing. Some hon. Members might have different opinions about that, but that is our position. It is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
sustainable to treat Europe as our main domestic market, but to remain aloof from the currency of that market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because that cannot be anticipated. The effect is cumulative. The Bank of England makes 0.25 per cent. adjustments to interest rates because fine tuning is necessary. I am referring to what should be the thrust of the policy. The details would have to be monitored periodically to synchronise our economy to fit in with the euro. That should be our objective, and it is probably an objective that the hon. Gentleman shares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need to move on or I shall not reach a conclusion; other hon. Members want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the prerequisites that must accompany entry to the single currency. We must have a strong proactive regional policy. At the moment, regional policy for Wales is in a quagmire of uncertainty. We had a long wait for the new regional assistance map to be up and running, but the Secretary of State did not say much about that in his opening speech. Last year, the Government failed to ensure that it was in place and accepted by Europe by the January target, and we are still waiting. It causes considerable difficulty for those who are considering investment projects if we cannot tell industry what the criteria for investment will be in some parts of Wales. I hope that the Secretary of State will be able to say more about that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European Union structural funds and particularly objective 1 funds could help to redress the centralising tendency of the single currency, but only if we have genuine additional money in the Welsh economy. This year, we are not receiving an extra brass farthing from objective 1 funds. For every pound that comes from Europe in structural funds, we lose a pound from the money available to Wales through the Barnett block. We are no better off, and until the additionality issue is sorted out that will remain so. The same applies to match funding, which this year we must find from within the block, so there will be less money to spend on health and education because more must be spent on match funding for objective 1 projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the challenge in the comprehensive spending review in July. Wales needs £360 million a year to obtain full benefit from structural funds and we look to the Secretary of State to secure a commitment on such funding from the Chancellor in July. I accept that, historically, a proportion of European Union money has come via the Barnett formula into the Welsh block, but we shall need an additional £250 million outside the block to finance the EU programmes that are needed in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a major challenge for any Government. If regional policy is to work effectively, differential taxation systems might be necessary in areas where the economy is overheating, such as southeast England, which is the background for the decisions taken by the Bank of England, and in areas where it is underheating, such as Wales, north-east England and Merseyside. That challenge will soon have to be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regional government is necessary in England and I hope that there will be some movement in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Barnett formula was established according to 1978 spending patterns. It is mechanistic and is based on changes in population; it takes no account of massive changes to the Welsh economic infrastructure, such as differential changes in public expenditure requirements in Wales, compared to England. I see that the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) disagrees, but I believe that the Barnett formula needs to be changed. It is outdated and insufficiently sensitive. A mark II Barnett formula should be devised that takes into account the requirement for need indicators, which should include a differential based on GDP per head in Wales and England. For example, for every 1 per cent. of GDP in Wales that is below that in England, a formula could allow an extra 1 per cent. for public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, detailed need indicators for areas such as health spending in Wales should be developed. It is often argued that public expenditure in Wales is high, and that is true in respect of health, but the overwhelming explanation is the age profile of the Welsh population. Many people retire to Wales—I do not blame them—and two thirds of health costs are incurred in the final two years of one's life. Wales therefore has an extra health dimension, and we need indicators for the creation of a new formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When commenting on a particular question, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) said that he agrees with the concept of regional government in England. As far as the Barnett formula is concerned, comparisons with England are not so simple: one might need to make comparisons with the English regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely. Areas such as Merseyside and north-east England might be missing out. There must be a sensitive, needs-based system. We have commissioned people from the university of Wales in Bangor to work on the matter, but I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
the Government will also commission such work. The challenge is to secure resources to meet our future needs, and we ask for no more than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman explained to his colleagues in Scotland who want Scottish independence that, although changes to the Barnett formula could mean more money for Wales, Scotland's block grant could be reduced by 10 or 15 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Public expenditure should reflect need. If we argue on the basis of need, Scotland's needs could be calculated in terms of social and economic reality. Like the Welsh, the Scottish people would have to live with the consequences of such an analysis. It is true that that is a socialist approach. I commend it to the Government, and I hope that they will consider it seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the comprehensive spending review, I doubt whether there will be sufficient time for a fundamental review of the Barnett formula this year, but I hope that the exercise will be established for future reference. However, it will prove complicated. As we know, substantial time and effort has been spent trying to establish a distribution formula for local government spending in Wales. The comprehensive spending review must provide a good deal, so that there is additional Public Expenditure Survey Committee cover for European money and funding is matched. Moreover, in terms of general UK policies, pensioners must get a better deal than this year's 75p increase, which was an absolute disgrace. If pensioners in Wales currently enjoyed the same proportion of average wages as they enjoyed in 1992, they would be £25 a week better off. The Chancellor cannot get away with treating pensioners with the contempt that he has shown so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the fundamental aspect of the Government's public expenditure policy. It is a matter of great concern to members of Plaid Cymru that new Labour subscribes to the right-wing orthodoxy that UK public expenditure should never rise above 40 per cent. of GDP. General Government spending as a proportion of GDP has fallen from 40.4 per cent. in 1996–97 to 39.5 per cent. in 1999–2000. There has also been a serious decline in UK public sector net investment as a percentage of GDP. It has dropped from 2.1 per cent. in 1992–93 to 0.6 per cent. in 1999–2000. A cut of 1 per cent. of GDP reflects a cut in public spending of £8.75 billion in the UK or £400 million to £500 million in Wales. We believe that that has inevitably led to neglect of the economic and social infrastructure in Wales in such sectors as new hospitals, schools and transport. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is the case, if less than a third of the proportion of GDP is reflected in public sector net investment. The Government are trying to get out of that by resorting to PFI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members may have a heartfelt attachment to PFI as a mechanism for funding capital projects, but we believe that it has a long-term cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many Labour Members do not necessarily have a heartfelt attachment to PFI, but we have a heartfelt attachment to new hospitals. In my constituency, a new hospital has just been opened in Chepstow and there is a new day hospital, Nevill Hall, in Abergavenny. Those are two examples of the Government investing in the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an example of the Government getting the private sector to put the money into those investments, because that is what has happened. I had an interesting meeting in Abergavenny with Denis Jessopp to discuss the delivery mechanism for that investment. I should be much happier if that investment came from the public sector and I suspect that some of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside the reductions in capital investment, we have seen a halving of capital grants to local authorities from £218 million in 1996–97 to £107 million in this financial year. That again causes problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I believe that the £22 billion windfall from the sale of mobile phones should not all have been used to reduce the national debt. That was plain wrong. 	<i>The Economist</i> commented that the Chancellor
	<br><blockquote><p>is taking his famed prudence to the point of perversity.</p></blockquote>
Even if the overheating of the economy in south-east England means that there should not be too much stimulus there, some of that money could have been directed as a stimulus through capital expenditure to such areas as Wales, Merseyside and north-east England. Wales should have been allocated £1.1 billion of that money for public sector capital spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the difference in economic performance between the regions of Britain; the same is true in Wales. Parts of Wales are booming. In the Cardiff area one can see a new confidence. There are new building projects wherever one goes. The Secretary of State cannot fail to have seen them, as he comes to Cardiff fairly frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must warn the Committee of the danger that Cardiff will suck in all the investment and the new jobs, leaving rural north-west and south-west Wales and the industrial valleys bereft.

Gentleman please not sweep aside the problems of urban areas, which have seen some investment and some progress in recovering from the devastation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are areas of severe poverty in every city. The advantage in an area like Cardiff is that one does not have to travel too far to see where economic action is taking place. Of course, I pay tribute to the Government for that; I am glad to see it happening. I am also glad that new guidelines have been given to the Welsh Development Agency to get jobs to the west, to the valleys and to the north-west. So far those guidelines are not delivering as much as one would have hoped. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] The figures speak for themselves.

The desperate plight of rural Wales has already been mentioned. Confidence has plummeted, and many farms are running at a loss. If some of them did not have a second income—from a wife who works as a teacher, for example—they would not survive. In the dairy sector, the price of milk has fallen from 25p a litre to 16p or 17p over the past four years. Farmers cannot survive on that level of income. Two weeks ago, in a meeting with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I proposed the introduction of a mechanism to fix a bottom price for liquid milk, which exists in the United States and Australia. I hope that the Government will act in that direction before it is too late. I also hope that they will not do anything to make things worse, as happened with the price of diesel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise three specific points. First, I regret that it was not possible for the First Secretary in Cardiff to commit the money that is necessary to safeguard the 1,400 jobs at British Aerospace in Broughton. I hope that it will be possible to find a way of doing that. The Secretary of State took that decision on the basis of the advice that he received. The matter did not, at any stage, come before the Assembly or a Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, that is wrong. The decision was taken by the First Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; that is what I meant to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the takeover of Hyder plc, I hope that the Secretary of State will clarify the safeguards that he is seeking with regard to jobs, consumers and the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry recently made a statement indicating that £100 million of state aid might be forthcoming for the coal industry. How much of that would come to Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional economic development is a matter of considerable concern to us in Wales. A little over a year ago, when the Secretary of State's predecessor was in office, the Wales Office was considering the use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
of operating aids in terms of flexibility with national insurance contributions. Such taxation measures have worked positively for Ireland's economy. That can be done in objective 1 areas, and I hope that it is still on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are hopeful signs in the Welsh economy. A greater level of confidence is evident, and more young people want to set up enterprises. I hope that they will be given the help that they need and that the creation of a development fund between now and the end of the year will actively assist in the establishment of such new ventures. I am glad that the universities are initiating projects under objective 1, and hope that they will lead to more jobs. Several major companies have recognised the potential of Wales for cleaner energy generation, which could be another source of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central message to the Secretary of State is that there has to be a move away from the current policy of the high pound against the euro. If there is not, much of the good work that is being undertaken by agencies such as the WDA will be undermined, and vital industries such as steel could suffer significantly. It is not too late; there is still a chance to change course. I urge the Secretary of State to take that message from the Committee to his Government colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The right hon. Gentleman is, of course, perfectly entitled to ask for more money to be spent in Wales. We all want that, and, sadly, have asked for it for most of our political lives. However, this is the UK Parliament, and he should be obliged to explain the economic policies that his party will present at the next general election. In recent comments, he made it clear that the kernel of his party's policy is that Wales should join the Council of Ministers and be a full member of the European Union. There is nothing wrong with advocating that, and he is entitled do so, but he has a moral duty—unless morality does not come into such day-to-day politics—to explain the consequences for the Welsh economy and for expenditure in Wales. He skated over that again today—understandably, because he is on extremely thin ice. In fact, there is very little ice underneath him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Welsh finance, the right hon. Gentleman knows that, sadly, public expenditure considerably exceeds money raised—the difference is 30 per cent. or more, and it involves £5 billion to £6 billion every year. That comes on top of taxes that are raised in Wales, but it ignores the role of Britain. He wants to leave the British union, join the European Union and become a full member of the Council of Ministers. Although he is perfectly entitled to argue that case, he must explain where the money that currently comes from the British union will come from, especially if his party wins a majority of seats in Wales. That sum is needed each

year, not every six years, as is the case with objective 1 money. It will not come from the European Union-with the best will in the world, and studying all the figures, he could not get more than about £1 billion from the European Union. We do not get much from the common agricultural policy because we, and Britain, have a small agricultural sector, although it is not quite as small as was suggested by my hon. Member for Newport, West. Ireland benefited from having, until recently, a large agriculture sector, although it is diminishing. At least 50 per cent. of EU money goes to the agriculture sector, but Wales would not benefit greatly if it were a full member of the Council of Ministers. He could not expect to raise more than £1 billion from that source. Where will the other 30 per cent. come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon has between now and the next general election to explain the figures, although he has failed to do so thus far—I have raised the matter with him over the years. Perhaps he should put his statisticians to work on the matter. Public expenditure could be cut by one third, taxation in Wales could be raised by one third—he was liberal in his approach to raising taxation—or he could combine both approaches. Whatever his strategy, living standards in Wales would be substantially reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend was rather modest when he said that the fiscal deficit was no more than £5 billion. Figures from the House of Commons Library reveal that as long ago as 1994–95, the deficit was in the region of £5.3 billion. One would have thought that the nature of Government spending would ensure that the figure was much higher now. The Library figures suggest that there is a deficit of one third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I learned many years ago in advocacy school that when I have a good point, I should understate it. One of these days, we may get an explanation from the right hon. Gentleman. He is asking for more money than the Barnett formula would provide. Where will those funds come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not here earlier—I came here straight from a sitting of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend said that he understates his good points. He is doing a gross good service to the right hon. Member for Caernarfon in his estimate of the tax increase. There would be a 30 per cent. decrease in expenditure, but a 50 per cent. increase in taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend is correct. We should pursue that matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On objective 1 funding, I, and others, have argued for additionality, and I hope that we shall realise our aim. That goal has been too long in coming—the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Treasury should have introduced it already. If we were entitled to £1.2 billion as full members of the Council of Ministers, from where would the additionality come? It would not come from the Council of Ministers. It would come from the Welsh Government, of which the right hon. Member for Caernarfon would presumably be Chancellor of the Exchequer or Prime Minister. There would already be a 30 per cent. fall in his public expenditure, so perhaps he will tell us where he would find the additionality for which he rightly asks and which we all want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a few weasel words about the pound and how terrible it is to have a high pound. We all agree, and I could speak for a long time on how to reduce its value. I made a short note of what the right hon. Gentleman said. He said that we must get the pound down and his first proposition was that the Bank of England should be instructed to take inflation and employment into account. I agree entirely. There should not be a split between fiscal and monetary policy, but is the right hon. Gentleman really saying that the Bank of England, if it were required tomorrow morning to take account of both inflation and employment, would be able to engineer a 20 per cent. drop in the value of the pound against the euro? It is absurd to suggest that such a change would have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then said offhandedly that interest rates should fall by 2 per cent. Has he not heard that the Bank of England is now independent and that there is a split between fiscal and monetary policy? He agrees with that split because he is in favour of joining the Council of Ministers. The right hon. Gentleman laughs, but is that his policy or not? I hope that he does not go into his wilder mode, because I heard an inkling of that in his laughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to argue the case for joining the Council of Ministers, but the European central bank would decide those matters and it is at least as independent as the Bank of England. He was right about the problems of British Steel, but what effect would a 2 per cent. reduction in interest rates have on inflation, if that could be done with a split between fiscal and monetary policy? The pound would fall, the cost of imports would rise and the Bank of England would have to increase interest rates because inflation would rise again. It was difficult enough when the Chancellor had control of fiscal and monetary policy. I should not reminisce, but in 1978 the pound was worth $2.20 and there were kerfuffles in the Treasury to try to bring it down. I remember sending out a minute asking how to devalue a floating pound. I have still not received a reply. Perhaps if I look in my mail, I shall find a long note from a Treasury Under-Secretary explaining how to devalue a floating pound. It was difficult enough when fiscal and monetary policy was in the hands of one institution, so how on earth can that be done when they are split?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
These are difficult matters and the right hon. Gentleman should not come here with throwaway suggestions. He should explain the central, cardinal points of his party's economic policy. When he has done that, he may criticise other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about the Welsh economy, as did the right hon. Gentleman, who made some valid points, some of which I agree with. Circumstances now are slightly more hopeful than a few weeks ago. Rover has been bought by Phoenix, and although that does not take Rover out of the wood there is at least hope that it will continue to produce and sell cars at Longbridge, which must be good news for the Welsh motor component industry. I do not know, and neither do most people, what effect the closure of Longbridge would have had on the motor component industry because Rover's sales were declining and its purchases were a declining part of the sales of many motor component companies in my constituency. Having said that, the closure of Longbridge would have proved extremely serious for the south Wales economy. At least Rover can continue to sell cars, and the Welsh motor component industry will be able to bid for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the problems that remain, the past three years have not been bad for the Welsh economy, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said. The right hon. Member for Caernarfon tried to poo-pooh the unemployment figures, and I realise that different figures may be quoted. However, in the constituency of Llanelli—the figures are available in the Library—unemployment has fallen by at least 30 per cent. in the past three years. That is true of most surrounding constituencies with a similar industrial and economic structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend gives unemployment statistics for his own constituency, but is he aware that the constituency that has benefited most from Labour's policies over the past two years is Ceredigion, where long-term unemployment has declined by 78 per cent., youth unemployment by 83 per cent., and overall unemployment by 34 per cent.? Indeed, the second biggest gainer is the constituency of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government can take considerable credit for a fall in unemployment against a background of low inflation, which is not easy to achieve. Moreover, there has been a reasonable rate of economic growth in Wales in the past three years. Unemployment remains too high in many parts, and a recurring problem—the right hon. Gentleman touched on it, and we are all familiar with it—is the low level of wages in Wales compared to the United Kingdom average. However, the figures for areas of England such as the east midlands, the north-east or the north-west would probably not be very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing has always lost jobs, and will continue to lose jobs, because of the tremendous global pressures exerted by currencies and technology. If we cannot replace those jobs with other manufacturing jobs, and if they are replaced with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
service jobs of the sort that typically arise in Wales, incomes will decline. The gross wage of someone who works in the motor component industry is about £300 or £325 a week, but pressure is being exerted by other regions of the world. Although manufacturing wages in Wales are generally higher than service industry wages, they are being forced downwards by so-called global competition. If manufacturing jobs are replaced by service industry jobs that pay, say, £150 to £225 a week, incomes will fall unless we can create more jobs. In all fairness to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, he is trying to create more jobs and subsidise—if I may use that word—wages through the working families tax credit. As a result, although wage levels may be lower, more people will be in work and we will maintain a higher level of income and purchasing power in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy, but we must recognise that manufacturing remains the core of the Welsh economy. Manufacturing accounts for almost 30 per cent. of Welsh GDP, and figures for the west midlands, the east midlands and north-east England are the same. Wales and those English regions therefore account for the highest concentration of manufacturing GDP in the United Kingdom. That puts pressure on manufacturing. There are the global pressures of competition and currencies. Currencies will fluctuate until we find a single world currency, but even then problems of accountability that are greater even than those associated with the euro would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also pressures associated with technology. I have represented Llanelli for 30 years, and as many as five motor component firms in my constituency have been under continual pressure. Frankly, I admire the management and the employees, and their ability to adapt. They have to fly round the world, leave their families, return late at night, then fly somewhere else the next day looking for orders and for work. It is amazing that they survive. I believe that they will survive the present problems because some, although not all, of our manufacturing businesses are world-class firms. However, the pressures are considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also pressures on the steel industry. It has changed considerably, and is far more efficient than it was 20 or 30 years ago. However, new pressures are now being brought to bear. The United States has experienced the near demise of its steel industry over the past 10 or 15 years. United Steel almost disappeared; Bethlehem Steel might have gone—I do not know. The great steel-making factories of Pennsylvania have practically all gone, but the Americans are fighting back with a strong currency, but we shall leave that aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that US Steel has recently bought a decrepit, archaic steelworks in Slovakia. It has bought it not to turn it into a Slovakian industrial heritage park, but because the Americans have new technology—not only new milling technology but other forms of technology that I do not understand. It has bought it to make an assault on the European steel industry, and it will do so. It might not succeed, and I am sure that European steel makers will be up to the challenge. I hope so. However, manufacturing
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
industry must accept that these changes happen all the time, and ensure that it has the skills and the capacity to resist the change and the will to go on fighting. It is a constant battle, especially in the present economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is that Welsh manufacturing is, perhaps, over-dependent on one or two areas, notably the motor component industry and the steel industry, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned. The west midlands has a much wider traditional engineering base. We like to talk about engineering in Wales, but we do not have a major engineering tradition there. We have coal, steel and tinplate, but not a high level of sophisticated engineering. Perhaps we are more like the east midlands or the north-east. The manufacturing sector in the east midlands is mainly confined to textiles and clothing. The north-east is now confined mainly to the car industry, although also it used to have shipbuilding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales should try to acquire the resources to develop a manufacturing industry with a more highly sophisticated engineering content, although that might sound ironic. It would take some time, but the developments must come from sophisticated mechanical engineering, from electronic engineering and from the new technologies. It will not be easy, because we do not have that tradition in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept fully the general point that my right hon. Friend is making. However, I hope that he is aware that developments in sophisticated, highly skilled engineering are taking place—especially in the aeronautical industry and in aviation engineering—in places such as BAMC in my constituency, and the defence aviation repair agency at RAF St. Athan. Those organisations are creating just the kind of occupations to which my right hon. Friend refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I am not making a criticism. We need more of that kind of industry, but it will not be easily achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These topics perhaps take us outside the range of the debate, and I shall finish in a moment. However, they are relevant to our education, our culture and the way in which we approach science and mathematics. There are two requirements if we are to move towards the new technologies: literacy and numeracy. Literacy involves speaking and writing English clearly, concisely and precisely. Numeracy involves a very high level of mathematical skill, and not just the O-levels that some of us achieved, nor even the A-levels to which most of us could never aspire. However, extremely high levels of mathematical skill are the basis of science, and if we do not move in that direction we shall not get the high technology and electronic engineering industries that we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) mentioned the defence industries. The growth in the United States economy has been phenomenal because it has adopted new technology. Its science-based industries are strong, and they are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
strong because of what used to be called the military-industrial complex—the rather hated military-industrial complex—which turned out people with great skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember years ago in another capacity visiting a United States aircraft carrier of about 90,000 tonnes, which had about 80 Phantom aircraft on it and 6,000 or 7,000 crew. Most of the ratings were young American boys, often from poor areas in the south, who spent five years in military service and, during those five years, learnt a great deal about electronics and technology. Then they left and went back into their communities, taking with them a considerable knowledge of technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain cannot go down that road, but we must look at our education system and establish centres of excellence—I cannot refer to elitism, because that is a bad thing, but centres of excellence are good things—to develop our skills in mathematics, science and technology. We have the young people, who can drive inward investment or develop indigenous industries; it does not matter which. If we do not have the skills, we will not get the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more Government assistance, but there must be a limit to the begging bowl—even to the begging bowl of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon. Perhaps he should hold off a bit from begging. I know that he is interested in manufacturing and that he spent some time in Merthyr working for Hoover and understands many of the problems. They will not be solved by currency manipulation, although there is a place for devaluation. I have never believed that devaluation should be ruled out; there is always a place for devaluation as one of the instruments of economic policy. Currency manipulation will not win us markets; we will win them by our own skills, depending on our own will and on the will of the Welsh people to succeed. We have the will. We cannot contract out of the global economy. We have never done so and I hope that we will not try to do so in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an important debate on the economy of Wales. I speak as somebody who lived in Wales for 33 years as a Swansea jack. I take this opportunity to congratulate Swansea City on its well-deserved promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating what has happened to Wales over the past three years and are looking into the long-term future, on the basis of the golden economic legacy that was left to it in 1997, at a time when manufacturing is in decline. Indeed, the First Secretary of the Welsh Assembly talked about Wales being in the relegation zone of the British economic league. The euro is in free fall. Agriculture is in crisis. I am sorry that the Secretary of State for Wales did not say more about the rural economy, which is vital to many parts of
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Wales. Bureaucracy is on the increase, taxation is crippling and red tape is strangling industry. It is in that context that this debate takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West was the Labour party's true voice on agriculture. In essence, he said, "Agriculture doesn't matter much to Wales. We should be looking at other sectors. Let's leave agriculture to its own plight." We must accept that Wales operates in a global economy. The strong pound and weak euro play an important role, particularly in manufacturing industry and in those parts of industry where profitability is marginal, reliance is placed on exports and companies do not import many raw materials for their products. In those parts of England and Wales, it is difficult to carry on when the euro is weak, particularly where companies are exporting to the European Union. We must remember that Wales is part of an economy that operates throughout the world, not just within fortress Europe or in one part of fortress Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the contribution made by the hon. Member for Newport, West on agriculture-a rather poor contribution, I might say. I ask the hon. Gentleman to look at the contributions that my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West and I made to last Thursday's debate in the House on agriculture? They are more reflective of the contributions of Welsh Labour Members representing constituencies in Wales and of their interest in and commitment to farming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's contribution. I know that his constituency is a rural one. I can understand why he would want to correct what the hon. Member for Newport, West said. However, Labour Members must sort out their internal wrangles before they get to the Welsh Grand Committee. Farmers in Wales will look not only at what the hon. Member for Monmouth said last Thursday, but at what the Government have done to farming in the past three years. That is the important thing. Farming is in its worst crisis for 60 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that there was a Downing street summit on agriculture recently, within three years of the formation of the Government? Had there been Downing street summits on agriculture during the period that his party was in government, agriculture would not be in its current state. Would he also acknowledge that the Government have produced £0.5 billion of agrimonetary compensation for agriculture in England and Wales? Under the last Conservative Government, not one penny piece of agrimonetary compensation was secured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a rather desperate contribution. The Downing street summit was necessary because of the Labour Government's mishandling of the agriculture industry in this country. That is also why we needed the agrimonetary compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is somewhat rhetorical. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that farmers were grateful for the state in which farming was left in 1997, bearing in mind the BSE crisis and everything else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The farming industry did, of course, receive support from the Conservative Government. Farmers and the farming industry are looking forward to the next Conservative Government. Reading the opinion polls in today's papers, I am not sure which is falling faster—the value of the euro or the Labour party's poll rating. I suspect that it is the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales are not listening to the spin doctors, of whom there are an increasing number these days. The First Secretary has just appointed four special advisers, and the Secretary of State for Wales has two special advisers. In the good old days, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) was Secretary of State, he operated with one special adviser. Bureaucracy is one of the fastest growing industries in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Secretary of State to what Professor Peter Spencer, the economic adviser to a business confidence survey run by Ernst & Young, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Given that it is less than 18 months since the economy almost went into recession, Government surpluses cannot be attributed to the result of sound economic growth alone. The answer lies in significantly higher tax revenues. Tax rates may have fallen, but a large number of taxpayers are now paying more tax.</p></blockquote>
The stealth tax is vital to that. It took us some time to get the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister to concede that the burden of taxation had gone up under their Government. That hits the amount of money that people are able to spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The typical family in Wales is £660 a year worse off under Labour. It is the stealth taxes that hit them every time they fill their car or buy a packet of cigarettes or some beer. Students are facing the disappearance of their grants and the introduction of tuition fees. Pensioners have endured an insulting 75p a week increase and a tax grab on their pension funds and MIRAS has been abolished and council taxes increased. Council taxes in Wales have risen by an average of more than 10 per cent., which is five times the rate of inflation. Taxation on industry has risen by around £30 billion. The pension fund grab raised £5,000 million from pensioners. Tesco has already asked its work force for additional contributions to ensure that they have decent pensions when they leave. A typical 30-year-old now pays £200 a year more for their pension fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should have a conversation about taxation with the leader of Plaid Cymru. The hon. Gentleman insists that the tax burden has increased dramatically during the Labour Government's period in office, yet only an hour ago the leader of Plaid Cymru suggested that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
will not raise the tax burden above the 40 per cent. barrier. I am a little confused by those two different approaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will not be alone in his confusion about the comments of the leader of Plaid Cymru—the socialist party of Wales—who was, however, talking about the expenditure of funds, not the raising of taxation. The amount of money that has been raised in tax during the three years of this Government is clearly shown in the Treasury figures from the Library, and even the Prime Minister admits that it has gone up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sparkling, vintage performance, the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), put the leader of Plaid Cymru in his place with regard to his simplistic economic notions. He thinks that he could cut 2 per cent. from interest rates and then claw it back through taxation. I can imagine the rates of taxation that would be necessary for that purpose, and inflation would doubtless rise at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned agriculture and the rural economy. One of the greatest stealth taxes, the increase in petrol and diesel, has hit industry and rural dwellers alike. They now face some of the highest petrol and diesel prices in Europe. When the Secretary of State talks to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the proposed climate change levy, will he give full consideration to its impact on energy-reliant industries in Wales? As we know, manufacturing industry is vital to the Welsh economy, and the climate change levy could seriously damage its viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to bureaucracy, red tape and form filling is now an art form in Wales. That is a major problem for Welsh businesses, whose competitiveness is being eroded. Even the Government's better regulation task force has said that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>evidence that entrepreneurs are being distracted from running and growing their own businesses by the cumulative burden of taxation and regulation.</p></blockquote>
Those findings have clearly fallen on deaf ears in respect of the Secretary of State and the Chancellor, because more regulation is being introduced. Small businesses in Wales have been hit by an increase in their national insurance contributions for the self-employed. They are also suffering from the burden of having to administer the working families tax credit on the Government's behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working time directive and the European social chapter are further blows to small businesses. A perfect example of that, for which we need look no further than No. 10 Downing street, is paternity leave. We knew that the Labour party's honeymoon would be over at some stage, and it is just as well that it has ended before the new baby is born. The Prime Minister sneaked into 	<i>The New York Times</i> the announcement that he does not intend to take paternity leave. He no doubt decided for very good reasons that he does not want to leave the shop in the control of the Deputy Prime Minister, who is his number two at Westminster. If the Prime Minister believes that his job is so important that he cannot take paternity leave, what is the situation with Welsh businesses, which may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
have only a small work force? One member-perhaps a valuable member-of a company's work force may turn round and say, "I want to take paternity leave." If it is all right for the Prime Minister to exclude himself because he believes that he is vital to this country, why should businesses in Wales have to put up with the pressure that results when a member of their work force says that he want to remove himself from the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman read the regulations that will implement the policy in the United Kingdom? There are many ways in which small businesses can claim exceptions to the general rule, one of which involves key workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never mind key workers. Many small businesses will be involved in what may be prolonged negotiations, which will place more burdens on them. I employ eight people in a business that I have in Swansea, and I am aware of the extra work, bureaucracy and red tape that are involved. Labour Members should spend time in their constituencies talking to smaller business people and perhaps offer to work in a small business for a day or two. That would acquaint them with the pressures that apply to small businesses in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the larger businesses, including Welsh Steel, Corus and Hyder, but the Secretary of State for Wales has not properly responded to the fact that it was the Government who imposed additional regulations and the windfall tax on such businesses. That approach has placed in doubt the ownership of Hyder. I should also mention British Aerospace and BAe Systems. We must use what influence we have with the First Secretary to ensure that the Government's loan, which I welcome because it will help to secure jobs, is matched by a relatively small sum of money, which should be used to develop the project fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not heard much about agriculture, although the rural economy and tourism are vital to Wales. The state of the euro has made it 10 per cent. more expensive for tourists from the rest of the European Union to come to Wales for a holiday. That could make the crucial difference—tourists may decide to take their holidays elsewhere. We have already heard from the Wales tourist board about the late booking problem-people are not currently booking their holidays. It is not clear what will happen to the industry in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On manufacturing, the Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades Union estimates that in 1999, the equivalent of one textile factory closed every day. Between May 1997 and December 1999, 82,000 jobs were lost in the textiles industry. Earlier, I said that two shoe factories, in Blaenau Gwent and Pembrokeshire,
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
had closed. We need to do all that we can to ensure that manufacturing industries see some light at the end of the tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The April 2000 Confederation of British Industry Welsh industrial trends survey revealed a continued decline in confidence among manufacturers and it explained that a sharp increase in job losses was expected in the coming months. The UK picture also points to further job losses, but not to the same extent as that in Wales, where the situation is very serious.
