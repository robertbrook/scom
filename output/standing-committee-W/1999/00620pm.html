Social Exclusion in Wales</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><b>[Continuation from col. 48]</b></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly quote Madam Speaker on the subject of electronic devices.
<br><blockquote><p>I have previously ruled that Members who carry such devices which make a noise should make certain that they turn off the audio function of the instrument before coming into the Chamber. I can have no objection to instruments which merely vibrate.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 March 1997; Vol. 292, c. 537.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue my description of the most important—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The highlight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The highlight, as the hon. Gentleman says, from a sedentary position, of our trip to the USA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my sense of irritation when some Members of Parliament, and members of the press, ridicule the Welsh Affairs Committee's visit to America, whereas they would never ridicule similar visits by the Defence, Foreign Affairs or other Select Committees? When it comes to Wales there is always such unfortunate carping about Select Committee visits abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. We gained a tremendous amount from the visit, and I am saddened by the attitude of some of the press. However, I am more saddened by the fact that some Opposition Members—one in particular, perhaps—seem to think that trying to tackle social exclusion is a joke and a waste of money. How will we find ways of tackling social exclusion if we do not try to find evidence of projects and programmes that work?<br><br>
The Manchester Craftsmen's Guild—in Manchester Pittsburgh, not England—was in a part of Pittsburgh that was in 88th place in the FBI's figures for crime in that city. The building had no fence or closed circuit television but was part of, and accepted and revered by the community, which had suffered horrendous riots in 1968. The project was built and expanded out of the dream of one coloured resident who had dragged himself out of the terrible problems there through art—in his case, pottery. He felt that he could teach it to children in the area to give them a reason for their existence and to build their self-esteem. It was a way to pull themselves by their own bootstraps out of their problems. Amazingly, it worked.<br><br>
Despite the absence of security measures there were no drugs, violence or damage. People saw the project as a resource for people living there. It was not imposed on them. It grew from a room in a church house and is now in premises of 62,000 sq ft and worth $8 million. It has a combined staff of 110 and does not use federal money. It uses local organisations such as the Mellon bank, Heinz, Bayer, BASF, ALCOA and US Airlines, who all understand that they get something out of contributing money to such a project.<br><br>
The project has now grown to the extent that it has training facilities. It trains people who gained no basic school qualifications to be technicians for the very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
enterprises that put money into the project. It is a fantastic project and shows that in the United States big and little companies see nothing wrong in putting money into such projects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it true that the inspiring person who started the project wants to come to the United Kingdom and is interested in developing a project in this country? Does my hF agree that Wales would be an ideal destination for him, and that such a development would be welcome there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. It was fundamental to the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild programme that such a project could work in other areas. It might well therefore be appropriate for Wales. We asked to keep in contact with people at the project, who I hope will come to provide encouragement and perhaps obtain funding for a similar project here.<br><br>
I now move on to Chicago—which is a glib thing to say, as the trip involved eight hours sitting in an airport thinking about how to get there. We must have considered every means of transport except pack mules. There had been three days of thunderstorms over Chicago and six different flights that we might have taken were cancelled. We eventually arrived at 10 o'clock at night, in a small aircraft, singing hymns because we were flying through a thunderstorm. In addition, our cab from the airport broke down half way to Chicago and had to be towed off the freeway. We thought that at any moment four by-elections could become necessary. Those are the joys of travel that people seem to think are so wonderful. However, what we saw in Pittsburgh made the trip worth while, even without what we saw elsewhere. I shall not continue on that subject as I think that I have educated the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) a little.<br><br>
In Chicago we saw a child care centre, called an Educare centre, although it was much more than that. It provided mothers with support, not just in getting back to work but with all their problems. In a typical Americanism those involved referred to the
<br><blockquote><p>Principles of the Incremental Ladder to Independence.</p></blockquote>
However, that terminology makes an important point. Leaving welfare is not a single event but an incremental process, and the welfare to work programme, as I have pointed out, must have a starting point and involve support while the person concerned is in a job. Participants must be allowed to take different routes to self-sufficiency. Those are all worthwhile aims.<br><br>
In Chicago we also met the deputy commissioner for the Chicago Department of Public Affairs and the director of the Center for Cultural Understanding and Change. We saw another project called Gallery 37. That was a job-training programme based in the arts. As a summer job, young people were introduced to interview techniques, CV-writing and other ways of entering the job market.<br><br>
Access to simple banking was another important feature of what we saw. In some of our worst areas there is no access to banking facilities that allow people to save or, more usually, to borrow at a reasonable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
rate. That was the Shorebank Corporation, which is a regulated bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve bank. The concept was created in the 1960s to operate neighbourhood financial services and economic development, and it seems to be doing good work.<br><br>
The public authorities in the United States seem to be more concerned about the ends rather than the means. They are much less prescriptive about details than public authorities in the UK. Individuals and groups in the USA are more inclined to give something a go than people in the UK, who seem to want official approval before they do anything—as much for emotional reassurance as for anything else.<br><br>
When we reported on inward investment, we suggested that we should use Welsh people abroad, particularly Welsh business men, as a resource, and that if Ministers or members of the Committee met people abroad from Wales they should try to forge links with them. Therefore, in addition to those people whom we saw as part of our investigation into social exclusion, we followed our own advice and used some of our free time, usually after 8.30 at night, to meet representatives of the Welsh Development Agency and business men and women with Welsh links. We organised a conference call with people from as far away as Florida and Canada.<br><br>
That is not an exhaustive list. I might have felt fairly exhausted this morning, but I could have gone on for longer. I am sure that my hon. Friends will have much to add, which in due course will find its way into our report. I look forward to hearing the views and concerns of all members of the Grand Committee, which will help us in our deliberations. We hope to report to the House in October, soon after the summer recess.<br><br>
Although the poor or socially excluded may always be with us, we hope that today's debate and the Select Committee report may result in there being fewer poor and socially excluded people in future.</span></p>
<p>4.12 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to restrict my remarks to about 10 minutes. I managed it when I last spoke in a Welsh Grand Committee and I hope to do so again today.<br><br>
Social exclusion is an important subject and I am grateful for the opportunity to debate it. I am delighted that the Secretary of State for Social Security was able to spare us time this morning to make a statement and answer questions. Not only is the Grand Committee looking into the matter, but so are the Welsh Assembly and the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) spoke about his visit to Philadelphia. I think it is inscribed on W. C. Fields's tombstone that, on the whole, he preferred to be in Philadelphia. I can understand why.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That quotation was slightly wasted, because we never went to Philadelphia. We were in Pittsburg, Washington and Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that W. C. Fields would prefer to be in all of those cities, rather than where he now is.<br><br>
We heard today from the Secretaries of State for Wales and for Social Security how important it is that we should visit other places and consider other schemes. No doubt the Welsh Assembly is taking on board many examples.<br><br>
The Committee and the Government want to solve the problem of poverty and social exclusion, but no one in the pubs and clubs of Wales talks about social exclusion. They talk about poor people and poverty and ask how they can make ends meet. They talk about the problem of expensive petrol in rural areas in Wales, about post offices closing, and about the problems caused by the farming crisis and the damage being done to the rural economy. They do not talk about social exclusion.<br><br>
We want something good to come from the visit to the United States. I want the Chairman of the Select Committee to prove us wrong. I look forward to reading the report, which I hope will produce constructive ideas and recommendations that the Government will implement. The poorest people in Wales will not read the report, but they should benefit from the changes that it proposes.<br><br>
I have about four points or requests to make, and it is possible that both sides of the Committee will agree to some of my suggestions. The Welsh Assembly is considering social exclusion. It strikes me as odd that, although it is discussing extra investment for the poorest parts of Wales, it is spending a disproportionate amount of time talking about the new Assembly building. The cost of the new lean-to—the downsized version—will run into millions of pounds. We should consider ways of ensuring that that money is better spent on the poorest parts of Wales.<br><br>
Let us put to rest the issue of spin. Ministers often say what a good state the country is in and how much extra money is being invested in X, Y and Z, but we should be aware that such money has a vital impact on the poorest sectors of Wales. Unemployment is beginning to rise in some areas. Changes in the manufacturing sector have a disproportionate effect on Wales. The sector is under a great deal of stress, perhaps because of the weak euro or the pressures of cheaper labour in eastern Europe. BAE Systems announced the loss of 750 jobs in my constituency and the neighbouring constituency only last week. The Welsh Assembly should produce the £26 million that is needed to assist the loan of more than £500 million that the Government have given for the A3XX project.<br><br>
The Confederation of British Industry has produced a gloomy report on Welsh industry. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>With total order books significantly below normal and a major fall in domestic orders since the previous survey the only positive news from manufacturers was the modest rise in export orders and the expectation of a further modest rise in the months ahead.</p></blockquote>
However, it was also stated in the report:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
<br><blockquote><p>The long-term health of the Welsh Economy depends upon Welsh companies making profits yet the CBI survey shows that profit margins are being squeezed out of existence. Goods are costing more to produce whilst prices are falling, leaving manufacturers with little or no funds with which to invest. If the lack of investment leaves firm uncompetitive, Wales, which has a large proportion of manufacturers, will see the current trend of industrial job losses increase significantly over the coming year.</p></blockquote>
The CBI is putting down a warning that we must ensure that the climate is right for the manufacturing industry. Will the Secretary of State again raise the issue of the climate change levy with the Chancellor of Exchequer? We do not want it to clobber industry in Wales, which is reliant on energy to produce goods, irrespective of how revenue neutral that tax might be. We cannot and must not let Welsh industry be hit by that charge.<br><br>
I have mentioned motorists. Other hon. Members must also be worried about the price of petrol in Wales. The fuel escalator, which was introduced by my Government, failed. This Government continued it for a while and, although they have lifted it, petrol prices were still increased in the Budget. The general price rise in oil should concern everyone. Some parts of Wales face petrol charges of 90p a litre, which hits industry and the rural motorist. It also affects pensioners whose 75p a week increase in pensions is nothing like enough to meet the increases of the past three years. Will the Secretary of State reflect on the impact that petrol prices are having on industry and consumers in Wales?<br><br>
There was more disturbing news last week. It is likely that VAT will be put on tolls on the Severn bridge. It currently costs £4.20 for motorists to use the Severn bridge, but with VAT the cost could rise to almost £5, which concerns me. That judgment will come from the European Union in an interpretation of directives that were signed many years ago. We did not sign up to an agreement to put VAT on tolls throughout the United Kingdom. Indeed, I always understood that taxation was a sovereign matter and that it was for the UK Government to decide whether VAT was added to bridge tolls. I ask the Secretary of State for Wales to consider carefully the impact that an increase would have. It would hit tourism in Wales, and would hit people who live in Wales but work in England and who regularly travel back and forth. I ask the Secretary of State to use his influence to see what can be done to ensure that VAT is not imposed on tolls on the Severn bridge.<br><br>
I mentioned the national health service and said that preparing for the national changeover plan is costing the NHS millions of pounds. Indeed, this Sunday, a front-page article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> said:
<br><blockquote><p>'The plans will require substantial extra work from staff at a time when we are facing disintegration through the loss of mental health services, community hospitals and community services.' Computers, printers, financial forms and stationery will be changed and new equipment for cashiers, vending machines and car parks required.</p></blockquote>
I assume that the article was written with an emphasis on England, but if hospitals in Wales are now preparing for the changeover to the euro, which will cost them an enormous sum of money, surely the Committee would agree that that money would be better spent on operations and health care in hospitals
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
in Wales, rather than on a changeover plan to a new currency, especially when we have not yet had the referendum promised by the Government.<br><br>
That especially concerns me because of the current length of waiting lists for operations in Wales. The number of Welsh residents waiting for in-patient or day-care treatment in March 1997 was 67,909. The current figure is well over 80,000. In March 1997, the number of patients waiting for more than 12 months was 6,274, but now the figure is 11,800. I have a raft of statistics that show how desperate the situation is in Wales. Statistics are one thing, but if a person happens to be one of those statistics, waiting at home for an operation or waiting to see a consultant, then they make miserable reading. We hear about all the extra money that is being invested in the national health service, and we welcome it, but we want to see outputs. The current waiting list situation is dire.<br><br>
I also have a list of operations for which waiting times are especially long. If a person wants to be seen by an ear, nose and throat specialist or for dermatology, gynaecology or urology, the waiting times are getting longer. Indeed, the current figures show stark rises compared with last month's figures. We all want the national health service to perform well. We want to see an end to the postcode lottery. We want to ensure that the money that is being invested in the NHS is properly spent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Eighteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says 18 years. We were in government for 18 years; the Labour party has been in government for three. They were in opposition for 18 years, and we have been waiting for them to implement all their great solutions, but what we have had was a questionnaire, sent out by the Secretary of State, allowing people only one week to complete it. Furthermore, there was less than a 2 per cent. return and the exercise cost more than £500,000. That is quite ridiculous.<br><br>
We want to see solutions to the problems that face the national health service. Even if we were to come to power tomorrow, there would still be problems in the national health service, including the problems of people's demands on it, which have risen exponentially in the past 20 to 30 years. Those problems must be tackled. It is about time that politicians from all sides sat down together to find solutions to the issue. I am not turning the question into a political football because that does not help anybody. We want solutions to people's real problems.<br><br>
Then there is the problem of the pensioners, which has been mentioned time and again. I know that Government Members have their own concerns about the 75p a week increase; some have mentioned the issue already. I have concerns about the increase and about the fact that two rates of inflation have been used. The rate of inflation used to put up petrol prices was much higher than the one used to put up pensions. That is wrong. Pensions should have been put on the same rate of inflation.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0527">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, in the winter of 1985, 5,000 pensioners froze to death in their homes because they were too scared to turn on their electric or gas fire? Does he welcome Labour's initiative to give £150 to every pensioner household as a winter fuel allowance? Will his party honour that offer if it ever gets into power again.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will ensure that there is a real increase in pensioners' incomes so that they will be able to spend money on heating. Last year, I introduced a private Member's Bill on the wind chill factor, which the hon. Gentleman's Government blocked. He and other hon. Members who have been to the United States will know that the wind chill factor can bring temperatures down more quickly than would otherwise be the case. Under my Bill, the calculation of when cold weather payments should kick in would have taken that factor into account.<br><br>
We want pensioners to be treated fairly and for them to get the rises that they deserve and not just gimmicks. Giving grants entails bureaucracy. The take-up of grants is not what it should be. We will ensure that all pensioners get any proper increase in the basic state pension that we can offer. They will not have to go through a raft of information and literature to see if they are entitled to benefits. I am also worried about post office closures, especially those in rural areas. We are all aware of the Post Office's £264 million loss announced yesterday. We are looking for guarantees that post offices will remain open so that pensioners can get guidance from postmasters and postmistresses on the benefits to which they are entitled.<br><br>
I will quote one or two Government Members. The Deputy Prime Minister has said that he was concerned by the use of spin and verbiage instead of the substance of what of the Labour party ought to do for people. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), who resigned his ministerial post, believed that people in Labour's heartlands were being alienated by what they heard and saw. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) wrote recently in <i>The Spectator</i> that people who had voted for Labour in 1997 had turned into a "tidal force" of those going against the party. Many other Labour politicians could be mentioned.<br><br>
We hear a lot about the north-south divide—we know that it exists—but there is also an east-west divide. Furthermore, there is a north-south divide and an east-west divide in Wales. We want the Government to produce a proper package of initiatives that will help those in Wales who are most at need. We must have the right economic policies to ensure that the unemployed can get jobs throughout Wales, especially in west Wales and rural areas, and that those getting jobs get better paid jobs than is currently the case. Farmers now operating on £4,000 a year can hardly make ends meet. The deep crisis in parts of Wales must be rectified. We should be talking about that poverty.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I advise members of the Committee that they have the Chair's permission to remove their jackets. It is customary to seek permission to do that.</span></p>
<p>4.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to express one theme today: we should listen to those in Wales whose voices are otherwise silent. We should seek out those voices and listen less to the strong, thunderous voices that we hear daily. The strongest voice in Wales is that of the farming industry, which is in crisis. Opposition Members have used hyperbole to paint a gloomy picture of the farming industry, but I want to say something optimistic about it—even though the crisis is real, and should concern us all. Anyone with any affection for the unique quality of Welsh rural life—and, indeed, the language—must be concerned by the threat to small farms.<br><br>
The way out of the crisis is not the one pursued by the Opposition parties. Subsidies are not the answer to rural problems; they are the cause. Since the war, a series of on-going subsidies has culminated in today's enormous sum of £10 billion, but it has not made our farming industry more diversified and enterprising. It is sectors such as organic farming that have diversified. In a speech that I made in the House some 10 years ago, I mentioned an organic farm that was visited by the then Secretary of State for Wales, Peter Walker. It is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas), and is now the biggest organic co-operative—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is about to relate his subject to social exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are to end social exclusion, we must take a realistic view of the cause of, and remedy for, the crisis in rural Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments, which were perhaps out of order, on the complete reform of the common agricultural policy. Is organic farming also subsidised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) Gentleman need not answer the question, which does not relate to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that those who are seizing the enormous number of advantages to be found in rural areas are not traditional Welsh farmers. In future, for every farming job that is lost, there ought to be as many as 100 jobs to take its place, because the land is grossly under-used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the most positive and socially inclusive developments is the All Wales Livestock Co-operative? Will he join me in welcoming that demonstration of the way in which the farming industry can work together for the benefit of itself and local communities?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are encouraging signs in rural Wales at the moment. Last month, a splendid article—which looked at Wales in 2020—was published in the farming supplement of the <i>Western Mail.</i> I commend it to all Committee members.<br><br>
We should compare exclusion in rural Wales with exclusion elsewhere. Fifteen years ago, 40 per cent. of farming income came from subsidies. The Farmers Federation of New Zealand stated that the almost total removal of farm subsidies
<br><blockquote><p>has given birth to a vibrant, diversified and growing rural economy. New Zealand's experience over the past 15 years…has thoroughly debunked the myth that the farming sector and the environment cannot remain healthy and prosper without Government subsidies.</p></blockquote>
It is scandalous that farmers have continued in the same old way for 50 years. They do not look to the market and new enterprises to solve their problems; they do not look to organic foods or imports. Britain is a net importer of parsnips. Most of them come from Australia, which is 12,000 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that the subject is social exclusion. I am listening to the point that he seeks to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that if farmers diversify for the future, they will escape the threat of social inclusion that hovers over rural areas—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about social exclusion. Farmers in Wales earn less than the minimum wage. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is being constructive about agriculture for once. He should realise that 60 per cent. of the former farming population in New Zealand is no longer in farming; they have been excluded from the industry. He talks about subsidy in Wales. But for that subsidy, farmers would have no income and be very much excluded. At present, 60 per cent. of their income comes from support measures, because the prices of agricultural products have collapsed. If they had not collapsed, farmers would not receive that high percentage of support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are to have a future without social exclusion, farmers and the Farmers Union of Wales must realise that the answer to all their problems lies not in a trip to Brussels, the Assembly or this place—I received 11 pages of text from one farmer in one day last week—but in finding their own salvation.<br><br>
I want to address the problems in rural areas that have been mentioned. We are told that objective 1 money will be used in a special, favoured way in rural areas. My constituency is outside that granted objective 1 status, but I challenge anyone to name an area that has the social exclusion problems of wards in Newport. The average proportion of Welsh households of dependent children and no earner is 18 per cent., but in three of my wards the proportions are 25 per cent., 41 per cent. and 43 per cent. respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am curious to know why the hon. Gentleman did not fight for the inclusion of his area in the map defined by his Government. The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane), myself and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
others successfully fought for inclusion of our areas—myself for Dyffryn Conwy. Why did the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) not do so at the same time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing my point, which is that those who argue for rural areas—quite rightly, they must argue for their constituencies—are not doing so fairly. If he knows of any area or village in Wales that has the problems to which I have referred, he should tell me. Both Opposition Members' speeches so far have been long on anecdote but short on hard facts.<br><br>
The proportion of households claiming income support in Wales is 25 per cent.—a very high figure and far above the average. The proportion in four of my wards is 28 per cent., 31 per cent., 40 per cent. and 47 per cent. respectively—by far the highest of any area in Wales. We must remember that social exclusion is not confined to the objective 1 area. I am not contesting the designation of areas; I am saying that there are areas of deprivation in Wales where life is brutal and cruel, and people lack the good things in life to which they are entitled. Theirs are among the silent voices. I can give myself a lesson as a Member of Parliament: those are the wards from which I receive the fewest complaints; they are the people who say the least.<br><br>
I want to pick up something that was said this morning about pensions. I shall be restrained on the subject of pensions, as I rarely am, and take just one argument that was made twice. It was argued that we cannot afford to pay a decent pension, we cannot afford to pay a better pension, we cannot afford to restore the link with earnings. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), has said that restoring the earnings link would cost an extra £4 billion in 2005 and an extra £7.5 billion in 2010. The Secretary of State for Social Security repeated today—not in those precise words, but in essence—that we cannot afford such sums; that they are beyond the country's pocket and would affect our economic recovery. That is the myth that the Government want to present to us.<br><br>
To judge whether the link is affordable, we must take into account the national insurance fund income from which pensions are paid. If earnings increase, contributions, which are a percentage of earnings, also increase. Indeed, the Government Actuary has published figures showing that the fund's income from contributions rises in line with average earnings. By 2010–11, it will be nearly £11.7 billion, which is much greater than the £7.5 billion that is needed to pay for the earnings link. Pensioners are not alone in being robbed. We could restore the link now—we already have more than the Government Actuary says is needed to cover a sudden increase in unemployment. We already have £6 billion more than is required. The money should be used to improve pensions and other benefits. That is why people paid into the scheme—it is an insurance scheme, not a handout.<br><br>
One of the Government's problems is that they are a young person's Government—they see things from the perspective of young people. They do not share my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0529">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
perspective—I should declare an interest as a pensioner and recipient of the state pension. I strongly feel the insult of the 75p proposal. People receiving a pension may have served in the war and take great pride in the fact that they have never accepted a handout in their life; they have never claimed a single penny. Now they are told that they will have to claim the so-called minimum income guarantee to get up to the appropriate level. They have to sign an 18-page form and ask for a handout from the Government, but their pride will not let them do that. That is the main reason for making the increase part of the basic pension.<br><br>
Many of those people paid 3s 11d into small works pensions—that was hard-earned money back in the 1940s and 1950s, but they often enjoy no advantages from it because the resultant pension is so low that it merely bridges the gap between the state pension and the minimum income guarantee.<br><br>
I want to discuss another group of people who are a silent voice and completely defenceless: those in residential homes for the elderly. If any group of people is excluded from society, it is that one. There are strong reasons for suggesting that there may be a crisis of elder abuse that will be as serious and shocking as the treatment of young people in care. The problem has many dimensions, one of the most important of which is the overuse of drugs on elderly people in homes. Those who work in many such homes do a wonderful job—it can be taxing and difficult to do so because elderly people can be difficult and trying. An alarming degree of abuse of elderly people has been exposed in a small number of homes. If we are to tackle social exclusion, elderly people must be a top priority.<br><br>
Another forgotten group is that of the invisible women who go to prison. We have an atrocious record in this regard. The number of women who go to prison in this country is increasing at three times the rate that applies to male prisoners. We may soon have the largest female prison population in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my alarm at the recent suggestion that, in view of the large increase in the women's prison population, a women's prison might be built in Wales? Does he agree that the way forward is to ensure that women are not disproportionately sentenced rather than to build a new prison?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much support my hon. Friend's suggestion. There is another alternative—we could use open prisons, where circumstances are more friendly to families. The chief inspector of prisons said that three quarters of the women who are in prison should not be there. They are there for the most trivial of offences—usually because of debt or shoplifting. They rarely constitute a threat or are violent, but they are treated as if they are expected to be violent and threatening.<br><br>
We are gratuitously cruel to families—when a woman is given a prison sentence, it starts that same day. She has to kiss the children goodbye and is gone
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
by the time they come home from school. Other countries may make arrangements for a about a fortnight in which women are given the chance to put their affairs in order. The circumstances suffered by women in prison are a disgrace to us as a nation.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to mention that group of people normally known as "the homeless". I have great sympathy with such people, and have been working with them for several years. There was a period during which my wardrobe was regularly looted and most homeless males in Newport were wearing my clothes, although some people have unkindly suggested that it was the other way round.<br><br>
If there is one policy that, with the best will in the world, we are getting wrong, it is the treatment of homeless people. The hon. Member for Ceredigion mentioned a group in Aberystwyth. The first myth is that very few people are actually homeless. The small number for whom the lack of a home is a problem will usually be homeless for only a brief period. Every analysis that has been carried out has shown that the problems of people sleeping rough are mental ill health, and addiction to alcohol and drugs.<br><br>
The Welsh Assembly has just increased the sum available by £750,000, allowing about £32,000 to be spent on every homeless person in Wales. That is a good, generous policy, made for the best reasons. However, it is twisted in that the problem is not homelessness, or the lack of a roof over people's heads. A recent case in Cambridge was discussed in the House last week. If we treat people as though their only problem is the roof over their head, we will have failed them. We cannot expect those with mental health problems suddenly to behave in way that is entirely acceptable to other residents in a hostel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the line of my hon. Friend's argument. Does he accept that the first step towards dealing with such people's other problems is often to get them into some sort of accommodation, where one can start to make contact with them and to address their problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. However, the reason why that frequently fails, and why we have a hard core of rough sleepers whose addiction to alcohol and drugs is such that there is no chance of their stopping being alcoholics and drug abusers overnight, is that many of our places of refuge are not wet-houses. We have heard of the dreadful case of the imprisonment of people who were running a home because drugs were being used on their premises. If they had done that in the Paulus Kerke in Rotterdam, they would probably have been given a medal for it. There, people who are addicted to heroin are being helped in a very practical way.<br><br>
We are failing people unless we understand the nature of their problems. In the case of alcoholics, wet-houses exist into which they can move and continue to drink while the work of rehabilitation goes on. Because of our drug laws, which owe everything to so-called tough policies that do not work, rather than to intelligent policies that do work, people addicted to hard drugs in this country have a strong likelihood of dying—more so than in any other country in Europe.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one problem is the pillar-to-post mentality adopted in relation to homeless people? I accept that, for some people who have experienced a family breakdown, for example, there might be a home available somewhere. They might have alcohol or drug problems, and mental health problems. The combination of the two is very dangerous for the homeless. They are pushed from pillar to post. Mental health services do not want to know them until they have kicked their drug and alcohol problems, and the police do not want to know them because they have mental health problems. Is not an integrative approach needed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A booklet is about to be published by the all-party group on drugs misuse, which addresses precisely the problems of those with a dual diagnosis. I shall conclude my remarks, because five other hon. Members wish to speak.<br><br>
To our eternal shame, we have the worst record in Europe on the distribution of our anti-drugs spending. We spend just 13 per cent. on rehabilitation. The remainder is spent on imprisoning people, often for using drugs that are nowhere near as dangerous as alcohol and tobacco. Those of us in Parliament, in the Assembly and on the Committee face an immense task in addressing the problems of social exclusion, which involve people who never approach us and about whom we never hear. Our main task is to seek out those silent voices and listen to what they have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Six hon. Members are trying to catch my eye. If all hon. Members make brief speeches, everyone can be called before the winding-up speeches.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse much of what the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said. I shall not deal with the homeless, because he said everything that needs to be said about that.<br><br>
There is no single indicator of social exclusion—it encompasses bad health, bad housing, low educational achievement, high rates of offending and, of course, poverty. It evidences itself in different ways in the communities of Wales, so we need to find the appropriate answers for each place.<br><br>
One factor that runs through the problem is poverty—both rural and urban. Bad housing is another issue that must be addressed. I regret that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) said this morning, the housing budget in Wales has gone down instead of up. That will make the problems of social exclusion worse.<br><br>
Last year, about 22 per cent. of working-age households in Wales had nobody in employment, compared with 17 per cent. in the United Kingdom as a whole. That is an astonishing figure. Youth unemployment runs at about 18 per cent. in Merthyr, Pembrokeshire, Gwynedd and pockets of Anglesey.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
As several hon. Members have said, it is important to look at skilling people and empowering them—youngsters, in particular—to get into the mainstream of employment through effective skill acquisition.<br><br>
There should be targets and regular monitoring to ensure that all policy areas are being followed, and followed properly. A labour market research unit is also required. The Wales Office document, "Mapping Social Exclusion in Wales", contains a useful set of statistics. I congratulate the Government on that. It must be followed up to ensure that progress is monitored in every area over the next year or two. Matters are urgent, and much needs to be done. To be fair, much has been done; I would not be grudging about that.
<br><blockquote><p>Rural Wales currently faces its toughest challenge. Many rural communities are disadvantaged simply because of their remoteness from the main population centres. Their viability is being threatened by the demise of local services such as the village shop and post office, public transport and health care provision.</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words, but those of Jane Hutt, Health and Social Services Secretary in the Welsh Assembly. She clearly recognises the urgency of the problems that are peculiar to rural Wales, and I congratulate her on recognising that action is required.<br><br>
Other hon. Members have referred, in the rural context, to the high cost of petrol and fuel, the lack of medical facilities and the long distances that often have to be travelled. The nearest hospital is about an hour away from the centre of my constituency, for example. That is not good for someone experiencing the so-called golden hour after an accident or coronary problems. The unreliability and lack of public transport discriminates against non-car users. Equally, higher fuel prices discriminate against those who feel that they have to use their own transport in rural areas.<br><br>
I shall not rehearse the Post Office argument again, which has been heard many times, suffice it to say that the proposals will hit pensioners disproportionately hard. I endorse everything that the hon. Member for Newport, West and others have said about pensions. We must ensure that pensioners have a decent income. If we are sitting on £16 billion to £19 billion, surely £4 billion or £5 billion—whatever the figure is—is not a high price to pay for those who have given of their best to us, to this generation. We owe them a debt of gratitude. I fully endorse what the hon. Gentleman and others have said and hope that the Government will look again at the situation, in view of the Chancellor's alleged surplus.<br><br>
I shall not delay matters unduly. My hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) made an excellent and highly analytical speech, which has rightly been complimented by all members of the Committee. I shall not go over the ground that he has dealt with in case I am compared with him—obviously I would come off unfavourably.<br><br>
I found the journey across America with the rest of the members of the Welsh Affairs Committee last week fascinating. I am sure that the blow-by-blow description of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), the Chairman, brought it all back to us. We learned a great deal, and much of what we saw will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0531">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
form the basis of useful recommendations to the Government. I hope that, when our report is to hand, the Government will respond point by point to the innovative and striking measures that we found, which are designed to tackle exclusion and poverty—I am sure that they will.<br><br>
I shall not delay matters this afternoon. I am pleased that we have been able to have this debate and that all hon. Members recognise that there is more work to be done. I honestly and sincerely believe that we are not doing enough for pensioners or, as I said earlier, to meet the rural crisis. I hear what the hon. Member for Newport, West says about farmers, but it is not their fault that they are in a subsidy vortex. They would much prefer to be out in the world market, but unfortunately the market is skewed and they cannot get into it. I hope that we will make it possible for them to access a normal, preferably subsidised, market, although they have been in the vortex for so many years they are hemmed in. I know that the hon. Gentleman is thinking about the problem, as we all are, but throwing money at it will not solve it.<br><br>
I accept what the hon. Member for Newport, West said about the farmers unions. Perhaps it is their duty to introduce innovative, local schemes to enable producers to obtain added value from locally produced meat. We should look in that direction and at co-operatives. The hon. Gentleman is right: such schemes should be developed, and objective 1 can assist. I hope that both unions, the Country Landowners Association and everybody else concerned with rural life will think creatively along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will know that young farmers are leading the way in introducing new ideas into farming. I hope that hon. Members will acknowledge that avenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that that is encouraging. Most of us met representatives of young farmers a couple of weeks ago and were encouraged—certainly I was—by what they said.<br><br>
I shall conclude by saying that of, 500,000 pensioners in Wales, about 200,000 live on income support. That is embarrassing.</span></p>
<p>4.59 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being able to be present for some of the opening speeches. I was in the Local Government Bill Committee. I want to speak briefly about poverty in Wales.<br><br>
Depressing figures have been mentioned in the debate. For example, we have the second lowest gross national product in the United Kingdom and were 18 per cent. below the UK average in 1997, when half of all households had annual incomes of less than £10,000. More people claim income support in Wales than elsewhere in the UK and one in six people determines themselves as having limiting long-term illness. Wales has more tooth decay than England and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
14 per cent. more conceptions under the age of 18 among women aged from 15 to 17. Those statistics are very depressing, but, as has been pointed out several times, they vary according to area. Invariably, the south Wales valleys are at the top of lists of indices of ill health and of poor economic statistics.<br><br>
The list of statistics is gloomy and we have a huge task ahead, but the Government have made a good start in tackling the issues. They have declared their intention to tackle child poverty and to eradicate it by 2020. That is a very challenging aim. When did a Government last say, "We are going to end child poverty"? As we have made our statement and produced plans on how to achieve our aims, we have got the matter out in the open where voluntary bodies can express their views. The achievement of the highest ever rate of child benefit is huge progress. When I became a Member of Parliament, I had campaigned for years to keep child benefit universal. I never expected that we would increase it as much as we already have done. In addition, we are trying to tackle poverty and disadvantage at an early age by introducing the sure start proposals, which are being adopted in every area in Wales and which are aimed at redressing inequalities early in life.<br><br>
The Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), referred to the Committee's visit to a centre in Chicago that was inspired by the American head start programme. We were tremendously impressed by its great efforts to try to redress inequality at a very early age. We were struck also by the high quality of every aspect of the centre, including its staff and the materials with which it had been built. Beautiful wood was everywhere in the building and everything seemed to have been done with the aim of bringing beauty to young people. I was very impressed and I am pleased that the Government are introducing the sure start programme, which will run along similar lines.<br><br>
I strongly support the setting of poverty reduction targets, as poverty is the greatest threat to the well-being of children and families in Wales. Poverty at an early age leads inevitably to homelessness, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) referred. He pointed out that any number of homeless people have had a youth of deprivation and poverty and that a high proportion of them come from care. We must try to intervene early and to provide support and encouragement to children and families to help them to overcome such inequalities. That is why the Government are working along the right lines and why I support their emphasis on work as the main route out of poverty.<br><br>
I worked in the voluntary sector as a counsellor and also in social services and local government. Experience taught me that work means not only money for a family, but a lot more. It gives boundaries to people's lives and provides social contacts. Although money and rising out of poverty is the most important thing, work has other significant and valuable aspects. I support the Government's stress on work, but we must make certain that help and a safety
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
net is available to people for whom work is not an option. Wales has an especially large number of such people and we must ensure that the safety net that is provided by the welfare state is strong in supporting them. They may not be able to get jobs because of a lack of them in their part of Wales or because of disability—there is a higher rate of claims for disability benefit in Wales. The reason may be health problems; more people have long-term, self-defined health problems in Wales than in other parts of the United Kingdom. Some of the people who cannot get jobs are carers, looking after people in their own homes.<br><br>
For the people whom I have mentioned, and for some people in work, benefit changes have the greatest impact on lifting children out of poverty. It is estimated that increases in child benefit and social assistance benefits reduce the poverty gap for families with children in poverty by 17.4 per cent. It is estimated that the working families tax credit, which, of course, I strongly support, will reduce the gap by just 4.7 per cent. That is a huge difference.<br><br>
Further increases in child benefit would get to the heart of the problem and reach the children who need help. I support the Government's actions, but we must maintain a strong welfare safety net.</span></p>
<p>5.7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted, if not surprised, by the earlier remarks of the hon. Member for Newport, West, who was probably attempting rehabilitation among Welsh farmers following his comments at the previous Welsh Grand Committee. His comments today did little to compensate for the insensitivity of the Government towards Welsh farmers' problems.<br><br>
If one group of people is suffering from social exclusion it is Welsh farmers. Recent figures from the Government's statistical service show that the net income of all dairy and livestock farms in Wales is forecast to fall by 25 per cent. between 1998 and 1999, to £4,500.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish giving this information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to make a brief speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do, Mr. Jones, so I shall limit the number of times I give way.<br><br>
Government policies have crippled the ability of farmers to earn a living, by imposing an unprecedented level of regulation and taxation on British agriculture, by misusing and holding back support payments for farmers and by letting in unfair imports of food that do not match the standards legally expected—</span></p>

wonder whether it is in order for time to be spent yet again on rehearsing issues irrelevant to the topic under discussion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is for me to decide. I know that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr Walter) is tackling the subject of social inclusion and exclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. I intend to talk about social exclusion in rural Wales, which is as important as social exclusion in any other part of Wales.<br><br>
A key problem, which was raised by other hon. Members and the Secretary of State for Social Security, is the impact of rising petrol and diesel prices, not only on Welsh farmers, but on everyone in rural communities. The Farmers Union of Wales wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week demanding an immediate cut in the duty on fuel of at least 10p a litre to bring UK fuel prices into line with the rest of Europe. Emyr James, director of business development for the FUW, said that while the price of fuel in the UK is rising, prices around Europe are falling as countries, including Italy, Portugal and Greece, drop the pump prices for motorists. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>The extortionate price of fuel is strangling the life out of rural Wales. Inevitably, it is the farmer who languishes at the bottom of the chain and has to subsidise increased transportation costs. This means he effectively has to pay the bill for delivering the pint of milk, the leg of lamb, or the side of beef from the market to the shop.</p></blockquote>
People who live in rural Wales have the worst of a bad situation. The FUW revealed in March that the cost of fuel in rural Wales was the highest in the western world. The impact of rocketing fuel prices is felt throughout the agriculture industry. Many haulage and transportation firms have had no option but to relocate to the continent to avoid our hiked-up fuel costs and road tax prices. Even in Pembrokeshire, where many refineries turn crude oil into petrol, diesel and paraffin, fuel prices remain high. Fuel costs about 85.9p a litre in villages near those refineries.<br><br>
Rural dwellers face a double whammy on fuel costs. First, the increased delivery costs in rural areas mean that petrol and diesel are more expensive in the villages and hamlets of Wales. Secondly, the state of public transport in those areas usually dictates that taking a bus is out of the question. A car is the essential requirement for most families. It is not a luxury as some politicians claim. For every penny rise in the cost of fuel, the Chancellor will make an extra £1.5 million in VAT alone. We already pay the highest duty on fuel anywhere in Europe and it is about time that the Government compensated people who live in rural areas and have to use a car.<br><br>
Farmers are some of the poorest people in rural communities, but rural pensioners and those on benefits and low incomes will face social exclusion if our rural post offices close. I do not want to dwell on that point because the people of rural Wales do not want a history lesson in post office closures. Instead, they want assurances for the future. Some 37 post offices have closed in Wales in the past 12 months. Most of the remaining village post offices rely on

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
benefits payments business for more than 40 per cent. of their turnover. The transfer of payments into banks through the automated credit transfer system threatens that business. The rural poor do not have bank accounts or the ability to travel to towns with banks and, if they do, they have to pay the increased fuel costs. I repeat my question to the Secretary of State for Social Security: what assessment has he made of post office closures in Wales if the Government implement their ACT proposals? Can the Government guarantee that there will be no more post office closures in Wales as a result of that change in policy?<br><br>
I hope that the Welsh public outside the Committee will take heart from the fact that we are debating social exclusion. With the greatest of respect, I noticed that even you, Mr. Jones, sometimes called it social inclusion. The Assembly First Secretary said that the phrase social exclusion was nothing more than meaningless spin from new Labour. After being appointed First Secretary, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>We need a language that voters can relate to, not just politicians, specialists and lobbyists.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it has been a genuinely stimulating and useful debate. It is a shame that we do not have more time to address the real issues of social exclusion. I welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter). We should not beat about the bush: we are talking about poverty. There is more than one aspect to poverty, which often involves social exclusion, but one cannot extricate poverty in Wales from the question of low income in Wales and the distribution of the social security budget there. That is why I welcomed the presence of the Secretary of State for Social Security today.<br><br>
I shall confine my remarks to pensioner poverty. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) for reminding the Committee of the great progress that the Government have made in establishing targets for dealing with child poverty. I welcome her remarks on the substantial and universal increases in child benefit. However, I want to draw the attention of the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary to the strong feelings expressed in my constituency—I am sure that my constituency is not unique in this—that more needs to be done to combat pensioner poverty.<br><br>
Poverty is defined by the Department of Social Security as households with incomes below 60 per cent. of the median. Accordingly, one in four pensioners in the United Kingdom live in poverty. I prefer the definition of the National Pensioners Convention whose chairman, Jack Jones, will be in the House tomorrow, giving evidence to the Select Committee on Social Security. The convention prefers to use the figure of £113, which represents the median point in income distribution.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
The figures are extraordinarily low. It is difficult for people like us, professional people who earn a good income, to comprehend what it must be like to have to live on the median income of £113 a week—and that is the median, not the worst figure. I endorse the convention's definition of poverty, which includes
<br><blockquote><p>The inability of pensioners to participate fully in the life of the community of which they are members.</p></blockquote>
The Government are in something of a dilemma on pensions. It is true that the average income of pensioners has risen substantially in real terms over the past 25 years. It rose by 70 per cent. between 1979 and 1997. At the same time, average wages rose by only 50 per cent. Fewer pensioners claim income-related benefits now than in 1979. That is because of the greater availability of occupational pensions. We must consider pensions in that context. However, the figures disguise the growing inequalities between groups of pensioners, particularly in Wales, where many pensioners are entirely dependent on state benefits. The figure for the United Kingdom is 22 per cent.; the figure for Wales is higher, although I have not been able to establish it exactly. That means that there is a particular heat about the issue in Wales.<br><br>
I am wholly committed to this Administration's project to create an enterprising and fair society, but I must express reservations about the direction of Government policy. I accept that the minimum income guarantee is an obvious way to target resources at poorer pensioners and I understand the argument that many pensioners are well off and we must make the best use of limited resources. However, there are problems inherent in a means-tested supplement: namely, that the means test, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West has already referred, can be a disincentive to saving, and many people fall just outside its requirements. Will the Government address the question of the large cohort of pensioners in Wales who just fail to meet the requirements for the minimum income guarantee, which has further implications in that people miss out on other benefits, including housing benefit and help with NHS costs?<br><br>
The Government must reconsider the state retirement pension. We must not forget that the Conservative Government severed the link between the state retirement pension and average earnings, which has led to a substantial decline in the value of the state pension. In 2060, the state pension will be worth no more than 66 per cent. of male average earnings—hon. Members will be familiar with these figures—whereas it would be worth £97.60 in April this year if the earnings link had been retained. I submit that if the earnings link had been retained, the pensioner poverty that exists in Wales would not be so prevalent. Therefore, I ask the Government to reconsider the question of pensioner poverty, which affects many people in Wales. If we are to combat social exclusion, it is absolutely essential that we deal with that.</span></p>
<p>5.22 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the lack of time, I have just abandoned the first half of my speech, which was a series of bouquets to the Government

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
about what they have already achieved. I ask the Government Whip to take that into account when brownie points are allocated.<br><br>
Like some previous speakers, I am a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. I did not join the Committee on its visit to the United States, but I look forward to hearing an even more comprehensive report of it. I want to take this opportunity to talk about some of the themes and issues that have arisen during the long inquiry with which we are currently involved. Perhaps I should also mention, because it explains some of the contributions that we have heard from the two Conservative Members today, that Conservative representatives on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee have been on strike during our inquiry into social exclusion. They have virtually boycotted the longest inquiry that we have conducted since 1997, during which we have been going around Wales looking at problems and projects. I can understand that because if I were a Conservative Member, I would be ashamed to go and see the results of 17 years of Tory Government.<br><br>
However, the news has not all been bad and I want to concentrate on some of our more positive findings. The first finding of our investigation is that comprehensive community-led and community-based initiatives to tackle social exclusion are working throughout Wales. We have seen examples of the very best practice in north, south and mid-Wales, and in both urban and rural areas of Wales. The organisational structures of those initiatives vary, but they show a remarkable commonality of approach. They are always genuinely of their community and have found conduits for making bottom-up initiatives work on a day-to-day basis. They engage with other agencies and local authorities, as far as possible, on their own terms and have not been created only to home in on a particular source of funding.<br><br>
Most important, they are about getting things done rather than sitting in committees, bemoaning the scale of the problem.<br><br>
Representatives of the development trusts, local enterprise agencies and community initiatives whom we have met have also told us of common problems. There is a problem of short-term funding. In most cases, one, two or three years of funding support is not realistic for the projects that our most deprived communities need. I congratulate the Assembly on recognising that fact in its "Communities First" consultation paper and on the general approach adopted in that initiative. Funding is often overly directional. One enterprise agency noted that it could get plenty of finance for more computers and IT training schemes, but that its valley was crying out for plumbers and electricians, and it could not get support to help train in those skills. A community-based, bottom-up approach must allow communities to identify their priorities and then support them.<br><br>
The problem of persuading long-term claimants to explore the possibilities of employment, when they exist, has already been mentioned in passing. They risk losing benefits on which they rely for the chance of an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
income that is little better and the threat of a long wait and enormous hassle to restore the benefits if the job does not work out, for whatever reason.<br><br>
We have a fairly consistent message with regard to the quality of service delivered by the Benefits Agency and its role. Citizens advice bureaux representatives, local authority welfare rights advisers and others have told us that the Benefits Agency in Wales all too often gives wrong information to claimants and potential claimants in face-to-face advice or on its helplines, denying those people income that could make an enormous difference to their family's quality of life. More often than not, clients do not challenge what they are told by Benefits Agency officers until matters become so desperate that they make a second attempt. The individuals and organisations giving us evidence also argued that the Benefits Agency should regard getting the right benefits to the right people as its responsibility. That would mean putting at least as much effort and as many resources into take-up campaigns as are put into fraud detection.<br><br>
What I heard from the witnesses, when taken alongside the recent Select Committee on Social Security report on the quality of services provided by Sema in assessing entitlement to disability benefit, makes me believe that we must consider the way in which we maintain the social security safety net. When we study the issue, we should question the direction in which we are moving in terms of over-reliance on means-tested benefits instead of using universal benefits.<br><br>
Another point that has come across time and again is that the excluded so often suffer a triple whammy when accessing private-sector services. Increasingly, they must travel further, they have less choice and they must pay a heck of a lot more. That is true in the food retailing, energy, telephones and, in particular, financial services sectors. That using pre-payment meters for electricity and gas is so much more expensive than payment by direct debit is a scandal—they are used almost exclusively by our poorest citizens. When it comes to banking and other financial services, especially to the provision of credit, the treatment by our financial institutions of poorer communities and the poorest citizens in them is close to criminal and probably should be criminal.<br><br>
I am conscious of the time and of other people indicating that they want to speak. The problem of post offices has been highlighted. That the crisis in financial service provision to our poorest people and to our communities coincides with that problem offers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deal with both problems. We could provide financial services not only to communities that have just lost them but to individuals who never had them.</span></p>
<p>5.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, having only five minutes to spare. I was going to speak on several issues relating to our visit to America, including welfare-to-work, credit unions and the banking system but will not now. I will pick the key institution that we visited from which we could benefit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
by taking on board its ideas. During our study of social exclusion in Wales, we visited numerous organisations and had many depositions. The key fact that has emerged is the lack of statistics that would help us identify exactly where poverty is and direct our limited funding into the projects that would be of the most benefit.<br><br>
In Chicago, we visited the Shorebank organisation, a community banking project that was started by some ex-1960s hippies who were committed to their community. They set up their own neighbourhood bank to provide local banking facilities when larger banks were pulling out and investors feared to tread. The money generated was reinvested into the community. The organisation is at the cutting edge of community regeneration. Its latest idea is neighbourhood market intelligence, which involves more than 2000 pieces of statistical neighbourhood information from the census, local and national government, private companies and independent polling. It includes data on skills, births, marriages, deaths, employment, income levels, spending patterns, travel destinations, ownership of key consumer durables and shop profiles and types. The information applies not only to residents, but to workers.<br><br>
The bank can help attract businesses by using that vast amount of information to spot business opportunities for existing companies and future business potential in the community. It can also assess the spending power that is exercised outside the community and provide the shops and businesses that are necessary to ensure that that spending power remains within. It can predict the potential of each neighbourhood and help draw up strategies to enable under-performing neighbourhoods to reach their full potential. Finally, it can spot niche markets and specialist sales, and make local businesses aware of local suppliers.<br><br>
Such information could bring shops, services, jobs and opportunities to the most socially excluded areas in Wales. As constituency Members of Parliament, all of us know of businesses that have pulled out of our high streets and have seen communities become all the poorer because of it. That is why similar information should be gathered by the National Assembly for Wales. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) paid tribute to the National Assembly for its mapping of Welsh poverty, which should be recognised. However, the information should not be compartmentalised and should not relate only to labour and investment. We need a map of Wales that is divided into different communities. Once we have that information, we can direct our limited funds—potentially £3,000 million will become available because of objective 1 status—into the socially excluded areas where it is most needed.</span></p>
<p>5.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. It is to the Government's credit that the existence of poverty is now accepted and that they have published
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
policy documents that set out ways of tackling poverty and social exclusion. I do not recall the publication of any such documents during the 18 years when the previous Government were in power. We have a commitment to recognising health inequalities, and we all remember how the previous Government denied their existence when they suppressed the Black report way back in 1980. It is to the Government's credit that their approach to social inequality in health care has been so noticeable. A range of strategies was introduced within the first three years of the Labour Government, including the national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the minimum income guarantee for pensioners and the new deal for the unemployed, which is now available to the over-55s.<br><br>
We learned lessons when we produced our inquiry report. I would like to say that we learned the importance of bottom-up initiatives. Top-down social security initiatives that affect the whole country are important, but it is also vital to recognise the significance of bottom-up initiatives. The tremendous bottom-up initiatives that occurred in Bonymaen and Brynamman demonstrated the significant impact that such projects can have in areas where they are desperately needed. We have also realised the importance of a co-ordinated strategy, and it is to the credit of the National Assembly for Wales that it has adopted its current approach.<br><br>
As most hon. Members will know, I represent an area that is regarded as one of the most affluent in Wales. However, Monmouthshire has the bottom score on many of the social indicators in the "Mapping Social Exclusion in Wales" document, including the number of loan parents. The neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) is probably top of the league according to many social indicators. We need a co-ordinated strategy between the National Assembly and local and national governments.<br><br>
I want to respond to some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West made in <i>The Western Mail</i> a couple of weeks ago. His article presented a caricature and was hypothetical in nature. There is social exclusion in Wales. We should not distinguish the deserving from the undeserving poor—whether that applies to single parents or takes account of the cause of a disability—or between the poverty that is caused by working the land and the poverty in urban areas.</span></p>
<p>5.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a constructive debate, which is what the issue needs. I am glad that there has not been too much trivial politics. We must solve the problem of social exclusion, wherever it is. It must be rooted out because the future of young people in Wales depends on it. They need a better future than those people who are excluded now. That is vital.<br><br>
Social exclusion affects the young, the very young, mothers, 18 to 24-year-olds, people in mid-life who are unemployed and pensioners. We heard about the 75p headline rate. Although that is unsatisfactory and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
needs to be sorted out, there are positive developments. Social exclusion is about benefits, welfare, low income, housing, employment, a lack of work, health and transport, including the lack of it. It is about people's needs.<br><br>
The visit to America raised the question of whether we want more economic independence or to stick with dependency. We need a humane way of changing policy so that we do not cause a crisis in people's welfare. There are barriers, such as low skills, poor health and poor nutrition, on which I have strong views. Those problems cause depression. We need training and education, and to do something about the acute lack of role models in many of our communities.<br><br>
There is also serious financial exclusion. Some large banks have abrogated their responsibilities. I have taken people from rural communities to meet bank directors in Cardiff to persuade them not to close a local bank. In one case, there was not another bank for 20 miles, which would have meant an unacceptable 40-mile round trip.<br><br>
Community development finance is important. It will solve some problems, but the poor infrastructure in urban and rural Wales means that it is hard to access finance, transport and so on. According to the statistics, in particular those given by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, average gross weekly earnings in Wales are 12.8 per cent. lower than in England; GDP lags 17 per cent. behind that of England; inactivity rates show that 5 per cent. more people in Wales are not working; disposable income is £56 less per household; and there is 7 per cent. more dependency. There is a mass of similar statistics.<br><br>
There is an awful lot—I nearly said a hell of a lot—to do to put matters right. We heard some interesting speeches, most of which were sincere. The Secretary of State laid out what he hopes will happen with objective 1 funding. We will see the colour of the money come July when we find out where it will be targeted. There is rank poverty in many parts of Wales, not just in isolated pockets.<br><br>
We must accept that the problem is the heritage of the previous Government's 18-year tenure. This Government are at least tackling the problems and trying their best to repair some of the damage. It is difficult to solve many of the problems. The hon. Member for Ceredigion mentioned the UNICEF report, which has exposed a scandalous situation. It is up to us to work together to solve the problems.<br><br>
The Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for Clwyd, South, described what we saw in the United States. Poverty and financial exclusion were to the fore, but there was a willingness to tackle them. I am using measured words when I say that much of what we saw there was inspirational. I thought that it was fantastic that people were getting stuck in. However, it resulted from a very unequal society. We, at least, have an overall appreciation of people's plight. Nevertheless, we saw support for community action and we need more of that in Wales. Many people in our communities want to put their backs into solving their communities' problems. They must be given the tools for the job.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd talked about Shorebank and the funnelling of money through the community. Those involved threw the banking rule book away. They do not make judgments about credit by the criteria used by the conventional big banks in this country, which often stifle initiative and enterprise. That area of activity should be studied.<br><br>
Rural poverty has rightly been mentioned. The hon. Member for Newport, West has an acute social conscience, but he needs to investigate further what is happening in rural areas. A constituent of mine lived for 14 years in a caravan without electricity and with the crudest sanitation. He was in poor health. It was only because people from the local village pub, who had a social conscience, came to tell me about him that his predicament came to light. In six weeks he was sorted out with a council house. He was not a lone case. Other people in Wales are excluded completely from the civilised amenities that they deserve.<br><br>
Farm incomes are at an all-time low, yet we are living through a period of terrific change in agriculture. British farmers must deal with a 20 per cent. hurdle if they want to export and must fight against 20 per cent. price differentials on imports. That is a serious state of affairs which has taken away three quarters of their income. It must be turned around. We must do something about joining the euro—but that is controversial.<br><br>
What is happening to post offices is part of an ongoing process. About 8,000 post offices were closed by the previous Government and about 800 have been closed by the present one. That must be stopped. I thank the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), who has not had a lot of thanks recently, for his work to save the community hospitals in Powys. They are going from strength to strength. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley, in addition to his usual diatribe, commented sensibly on the price of petrol. I do not know whether hon. Members were aware that the price of petrol in rural Wales is the highest in the world. The hon. Gentleman also spoke sensibly about farm incomes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was right when he spoke of the necessity of ensuring decent incomes for pensioners. The hon. Member for Cardiff, North talked about child poverty and the importance of child benefit, which is crucial to solving many problems. The hon. Member for North Dorset talked about the plight of dairy farmers, many of whom now receive a net income of £4,500 and are leaving the industry. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West talked in particular about pensioner poverty, and the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) talked about the importance of community initiatives and benefits take-up.<br><br>
There are many problems of social exclusion in Wales and there are also many answers. We must search out those answers and I am confident that the Welsh Affairs Committee report will provide many solutions. However, we must have the means to deliver those solutions. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to discuss the report—it might have been good to have the report in front of us today.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
Many people in our communities are socially excluded. Typical cases are one-parent families: the children must go to work for their parent and the family has no hot water in their rented home. Some must walk a four-mile round trip to school in secondhand shoes and clothes. They are bullied at school, asked where their father is and must fight back with bare fists. They fight back because they really are suffering, but there is a way out and there are solutions. Only those who have experienced it really know what social exclusion is. The young boy whose situation I have described grew up in rural Wales—and that boy was me.</span></p>
<p>5.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an important and interesting debate, to which many h Members have contributed. We have heard contributions from 10 hon. Members in all during today's debate. In addition, we have heard significant contributions from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, who kicked off the debate. I also welcome the fact that we had the opportunity to hear from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, who spoke on behalf of the Government on issues that have not been devolved but are important to Wales. Hon. Members have put their arguments forcefully and, to echo what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) said, they have spoken with care and compassion. The Committee cares about social exclusion. I look forward to reading the report of the Welsh Affairs Committee, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South, who, like other hon. Members, spoke about his experience of the investigations undertaken by that Cttee for its report.<br><br>
I want to state the Government's policy regarding social exclusion. As right hon. and hon. Members will be aware, the Government have published a document entitled "Opportunity for all", produced by the Secretary of State for Social Security. I want to quote the Government's overall objective as stated in that report. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>The Government believes that everyone should have the opportunity to achieve their potential But too many people are denied that opportunity. It is wrong and economically inefficient to waste the talents of even one single person. Our aim is to end injustice which holds people back and prevents them from making the most of themselves… Put simply our goal is to end child poverty in 20 years…The Government is committed to tackling poverty and its causes…We have set ourselves challenging goals…We list the indicators against which we will monitor our progress at the end of this chapter.</p></blockquote>
I hope that also answers the point about targets raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy.<br><br>
It is important for the Committee to recognise that the Government have set that target. Many hon. Members, particularly Labour Members, said that it is the first time that the Government have set themselves the target of tackling social exclusion and poverty. The key point that I would like to draw out from the debate is that we need a partnership to achieve that target. Hon. Members have mentioned the role of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
National Assembly for Wales, and the United Kingdom Government has obviously made a contribution, but local authorities, too, are key partners in tackling social exclusion. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South, as a result of his experience in America, told us that the private sector is helping by fulfilling its community responsibilities. All are equally important in tackling social exclusion. I shall come to our key policies in a moment.<br><br>
We have touched on the question of rural and urban areas in Wales. It is a complex map. For instance, in my constituency of Delyn, some of the wealthiest people in Wales live only three miles away from some of the poorest. We must recognise that we have a patchwork of responsibility with regard to social exclusion—and social inclusion. It is a patchwork because great wealth exists side by side with great poverty.<br><br>
The Government have defined social exclusion as the lack of employment and of educational opportunities, poor housing, high crime, drugs and the prevalence of abuse, poverty of finance, poverty of opportunity, poor health and the lack of access to public and other services. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, including my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North, for Vale of Clwyd, for Monmouth, for Clwyd, West, for Gower and for Clwyd, South, and the hon. Members for Ceredigion, for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Brecon and Radnorshire have highlighted—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But not the Tories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will allow me, I shall come to the Tories in a moment.<br><br>
Those key issues identify what social exclusion is, and it affects all of us. It affects every person who lives and resides in Wales, either because social exclusion has an impact on them or because their neighbourhoods are the poorer as a result of it. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd suggested that the Government could gather information on social exclusion, and I shall certainly see what we can do to help to identify those issues, especially in Wales.<br><br>
The question then arises of what the Government can do about poverty, education, poor housing, high crime, poor finances and so on. There was a nugget of truth in what the hon. Member for Ceredigion said. The Government can do several things, and we can act positively or negatively. I hate to break the consensus, but during their 18 years in office the Conservatives did not close the gap created by social exclusion; they widened it. They made life opportunities for people in my constituency and in other constituencies poorer. As a result, people had less opportunity and less of a chance to have a fair crack of the whip in life. People's lives were made more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one believes that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can take the hon. Gentleman to various places in my constituency and show him that people have better opportunities now than they had between 1979 and 1997. Many other hon. Members

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
could show him similar problems in their constituencies. I am not making a party-political point. It is a matter of statistical fact.<br><br>
Hon. Members have mentioned a range of measures that the Govt could take. The Government could take the opportunities that the hon. Members for North Dorset and for Ribble Valley took when the Conservative party was in office, or they could embrace the positive policies that many of my hon. Friends and members of other parties have suggested to help tackle social exclusion.<br><br>
Employment was mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth and for Cardiff, North. The new deal has created employment. It has put people back into work and is helping to support training. The employment zones for north-west Wales, for the heads of the valleys and for Caerphilly that have been mentioned are important. As hon. Members have mentioned, the Government have pursued economic pathways for high technology, which are important. There has been the opportunity for extra investment in education. Education is the key to lifting people out of social exclusion.<br><br>
On high crime, the Government have committed extra money for police, have implemented the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and, with the National Assembly for Wales, are considering a drug abuse prevention strategy. The Assembly, following a Welsh Office initial paper of March 1999, has considered establishing a social inclusion fund worth £48 million.<br><br>
We have considered the question of poverty of income and hon. Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Clwyd, West and for Newport, West and the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, have rightly raised the question of pensioner poverty. The Government have done a great deal to support and develop pensioner incomes. The winter fuel payments and other help and support are valuable. The Government acted on the minimum income guarantee for the poorest pensioners to give them priority. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned that 200,000 pensioners in Wales were on the minimum income guarantee, but I can tell him that 90,000 pensioner households in Wales qualify for MIG.<br><br>
Tackling wider issues of income is also important. In Wales, 109,000 people benefit from the minimum wage. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North highlighted the working families tax credit in her contribution. Since January of this year, 60,000 people in Wales have benefited from that credit, which Conservatives would scrap if they ever gained the levers of power again.<br><br>
A key issue on easing social exclusion is the increase in child benefit, which my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
Cardiff, North mentioned. Child benefit has been increased by 26 per cent. since the general election, and with the increase in health spending of £1.3 billion and the overall targets for reducing and ending child poverty, it is clear that the Government have made a significant contribution through their policies to alleviate child poverty and the poverty that social exclusion brings.<br><br>
Rural areas benefit from Government policies on pensions, the working families tax credit, child benefit and others measures. The Government have also put considerable resources into those areas. To take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West and by Opposition Members, the Government are keen to tie expenditure to diversification and to challenge farming communities, thereby helping to raise the level of basic income. We all recognise that farming communities cannot live on subsidies for ever. The Government have made strong commitments. The No. 10 action plan from the summit that I attended on behalf of the Government in Wales laid out measures to ensure that British farming would be more sustainable, dynamic and diverse.<br><br>
The hon. Members for North Dorset and for Brecon and Radnorshire mentioned the Post Office report. They will have to wait slightly longer for the Government's response. The Government are seriously considering how we can support and develop post offices. Last Friday, I went to mid-Wales to visit two post offices, to talk to the postmistresses in both and to glean from them what the Government can do. We shall shortly produce the report of the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit. I hope that that will be an important contribution and that it will help to develop greater support for the post office network in rural areas, so that post offices can diversify and respond to a range of issues, as farmers can, to contribute to society in future.<br><br>
The Government are concerned to ensure that we take positive action. The hon. Members for Ribble Valley and for North Dorset should not lecture us on what the Conservative party would do; we had 18 years of that. My esteemed colleagues from the nationalist Plaid Cymru party could never do any of the things that the Government are doing if they had income only from Wales. The Cabinet of the Assembly and the United Kingdom Government are helping to deliver radical social change and radical support in Wales because of the UK Government's contribution.</span></p>

Welsh Gross Domestic Product</div> <!-- title -->
<p>14. <span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the proportion of Welsh gross domestic product which is contributed by (<i>a</i>) manufacturing industries, (<i>b</i>) the steel industry and (<i>c</i>) farming after the deduction of all subsidies. [125658]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Based on the last published information on gross domestic product for Wales broken down by industry, which was for 1996: <i>(a)</i> 23 per cent., <i>(b)</i> 6 per cent., <i>(c)</i> 2 per cent.<br><br>
In an Assembly question on 24 May 2000, using unpublished 1998 data, Christine Gwyther estimated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
that agriculture contributed 1.4 per cent. to GDP in Wales, falling to 0.6 per cent. excluding direct subsidies and close to zero per cent. when direct and indirect support is excluded.<br><br>
The fall in the farming percentage between 1996 and 1998 is indicative of the problems faced by farmers since the BSE crisis. However, agriculture contributes more to employment than to GDP, and has wider effects on environment and landscape not captured within GDP measurement.</span></p>

Radioactivity (North Sea)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>15. <span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions he has had with (<i>a</i>) Cabinet colleagues and (<i>b</i>) Assembly secretaries about radioactivity levels in the Irish sea and links with the incidence of cancer in north Wales. [125659]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have regular discussions with Cabinet colleagues, the First Secretary and Assembly secretaries on a wide range of issues.<br><br>
The main responsibility for monitoring radioactivity off the Welsh coastline now rests with the Food Standards Agency and the Environment Agency. The results of the monitoring programme are published regularly.<br><br>
The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment concluded that there was no evidence to support the claim that there was a higher than normal incidence of childhood leukaemia along the north Wales coastline. The Assembly Secretary for Health announced the results of strenuous investigations into these claims last summer.</span></p>
