Welsh Economy</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Welsh economy.—[<i>Mr. Paul Murphy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make a short speech because I believe that many other hon. Members wish to speak before my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) sums up. The standard of debate this morning was high. I especially noted the intellectual rigour of the points that the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) put to the right hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley), whose speech was well researched. At one stage, I was tempted to ask whether exchange rates should be determined in Cardiff or in Europe, but I guessed that that would have led to some protest, so I desisted.<br><br>
Manufacturing is of great concern, and we have discussed the importance of the steel and car industries. However, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to what has been happening in the textile industry in Wales, especially in relation to women employed in that industry. I advise hon. Members to read the <i>G2</i> section of <i>The Guardian</i> today. The article says:
<br><blockquote><p>It might make less spectacular headlines than Longbridge or Dagenham, but the fact that textile workers are scattered does not lessen the impact of redundancy. While a quarter of the industry is based in the east Midlands, there are significant centres in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Scotland and south Wales.</p></blockquote>
The article goes on to describe what has happened to women working in the textile industry in the valleys, at the Baird factory, Cohen's and other firms that have folded. At Dewhurst in my constituency, all the work has gone to Morocco, where it will be carried out for rock-bottom wages. We should be very concerned about that. As the article says, those women supported the miners during the miners' strike, but they have been forgotten now that they are losing their jobs at places like Maesteg and Ystradgynlais in my constituency, as well as in many other places. Those women were the breadwinners of their families. Something must be done urgently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the action of Marks and Spencer leaves a lot to be desired? It insists on sourcing from the third world, at great cost to jobs in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. The actions of Marks and Spencer are absolutely despicable and have polished off some very poor communities.<br><br>
We have mentioned many other problems in manufacturing. In farming, especially dairy farming,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
tenant farmers are in an almost impossible situation. One Powys county council tenant has been farming 65 acres for the past 30 years. He raised a family of three children. One child became a doctor, another became a manager and another became an adviser. That farm is no longer viable and will never again rear such a family because the milk price has gone down from 25p to 16p. That farmer is giving up and his farm will be amalgamated with another farm. Those women and those tenant farmers are the sort of people in whom we should take an interest. We should ensure that they have a future. Indeed, I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State say that an interest must be taken in the whole of Wales and all its industries.<br><br>
I thank the Government for yesterday's announcement of an increase in the agricultural sector for over-30-month cattle. That will make a big difference to the overall income of beef and dairy farmers. It will be a great help; it is especially good to mention it now because it happened only yesterday.<br><br>
Indigenous business will obviously be extremely important in Wales for the small business sector, particularly for start-ups, because it will help to ensure that young people remain in our communities. I believe that big opportunities will arise in communications. The idea of having a development bank, which has been the policy of the Liberal Democrat party policy and of Plaid Cymru, the party of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon, has been adopted by the First Secretary and the National Assembly. I believe that it should have a fair wind, because it is a vital part of risk capital to ensure that small businesses thrive, particularly for our young people.<br><br>
In passing, I believe that the abolition of the Development Board for Rural Wales was a complete and utter disaster. It should have been extended to all rural areas of Wales. It has been asset-stripped of its best staff and business advisers. The remaining staff are working their socks off and I congratulate them, but we have seen a diminution in the effectiveness of rural advice for small business. I am sad to report that, but it was an inevitable result of the development board's abolition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern about the abolition of the board and its integration into the Welsh Development Agency. Does he not recognise that it was necessary so that the development agency could compete effectively with the regional developments agencies in the rest of the United Kingdom, which have wider remits? Not making that move might have placed us at a great disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, but I do not agree with him. The board focused on rural matters and rural development. We need to focus on those aspects still, even if it means having a further reorganisation in the Welsh Development Agency to allow it to use its expertise to deal with rural problems as it now does to deal with urban industrialisation problems. There is a synergy, but the rural part has unfortunately been diluted.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
The future of Hyder, the largest company in Wales stands at an important, perhaps disastrous, crossroads. I read today—I have mentioned it before—that the United Kingdom will suffer a 30 per cent. shortfall in its water supply. All accurate forecasters agree that there will be a shortage of water. Heaven knows, we have plenty of water in Wales. It is one of our major assets. The right outcome to the ownership battle for Hyder is vital, but I very much regret that it is going from Welsh ownership. It is alarming to know that 30 per cent. of the shareholders reside in the United States.<br><br>
Perhaps I should not be talking about this now; I hope that I am still covered by parliamentary privilege. A competitive bid is being made by Western Power, an American company which could easily do a deal with that 30 per cent. of American shareholders in Hyder. We must be extremely careful about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the sadder facts of the change of ownership of Hyder is that we in Wales will be deprived of a group that has been extremely generous in its involvement with community work. It is most unlikely that a foreign-owned group would have that same involvement, leaving aside the matter of employment and the other benefits that we have gained from the present company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. It is vital that the headquarters of Hyder remain in Wales and that employment in Hyder is secured. It is also crucial that there should be no hiving off or asset stripping of water supplies to north-west England. Those three important principles must be adhered to.<br><br>
I think that the Western Power bid is subject to examination by the Office of Fair Trading. It has been noted because of the company's other interests and operations. All hon. Members, from whatever party we come and whatever area of Wales we represent, must take a strong interest in the future of Hyder and in securing the continuation of its operations in Wales. I assure the Committee that, in 50 years' time, water will be one of the most valuable commodities in the whole of western Europe we do not need much imagination to realise that, and we must take cognisance of it.</span></p>
<p>4.10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity to make what I hope will be a brief contribution. It will remain short if Opposition Members do not lead me down any false highways.<br><br>
The contribution made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was breathtaking in its cheek. All that I heard from him was that Wales was crippled and strangled, that manufacturing was in terminal decline, that the farmers of Wales were just about to disappear over the horizon and so on. I asked myself whether this was Rip van Evans speaking. I desperately tried to think, but I could not recall hearing the hon. Gentleman making a speech on the loss of jobs in manufacturing during the 18 years when
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
his party was in government. I could not recall him making any speeches when he was a Member of Parliament during that time, and no news releases came out of that Swansea paper shop when the steel industry in Wales lost about 15 per cent. of jobs in the early 1980s, when the hon. Gentleman was still rampant or, rather, crawling—on the political scene in south Wales. We heard nothing from the hon Gentleman in that time.<br><br>
Everywhere in the developed world, manufacturing jobs are on the decline. That applies even the most prosperous and strong economies, simply because technology is making many jobs obsolescent. and, unfortunately, workers become redundant as a result. It is the duty of Governments to try to provide different opportunities or training, so that people who lose their jobs and are coming on to the job market can find opportunities in new sectors.<br><br>
The truth is that employment has risen under this Government. As was pointed out this morning, wages have made a real-terms increase. On top of that, the minimum wage in Wales has helped 100,000-plus people. The working families tax credit has helped about 60,000 families and, on average, has provided an improvement of about £1,000 in their take-home income. Almost 2,000 families in my constituency have been helped. When we look at the big picture, there is no doubt that the Government have been and are being successful. There are more jobs and people are becoming more prosperous. Inflation is under control; despite the slight jump in today's figure, which relates to the abolition of MIRAS, the underlying rate remains well within the Government's targets. The ratio of debt to GDP is coming down at a time of increased public spending. The big picture is good.<br><br>
We look forward to the implementation of the objective I programme to help the areas of Wales with special problems—the valley communities, or those that were not necessarily in the valleys but were part of the traditional coal and steel-making industries of Wales, as well as rural communities where, because of the decline in agricultural job opportunities, special action is needed. No fair-minded person would attribute those problems to the past two or three years. In fact, some things have begun to improve in that time. However, there has been a steady decline. This morning, the Barnett formula was mentioned and it was pointed out that, since it was devised, GDP in Wales has been reduced by 10 per cent. or more. That process continued through the 1980s and most of the 1990s. We now have an opportunity in Wales to turn that around.<br><br>
Despite the big picture being good, however, we cannot turn our eyes away from the problems. We are all aware of the long-term problems. We must remember that, although the high interest rates are helping to keep inflation stable, they put pressure on manufacturing and steel making. Recent figures show marginal improvements in production in both sectors, but we cannot ignore the warnings that the balance is very fine. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has a difficult job to do in getting that balance right So far, taking the economy—and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
economy of Wales—as a whole, a good job is being done.<br><br>
The idea that we can manage exchange rates down is hoping for the impossible—the gold crock at the end of the rainbow. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) pointed out in his brilliant contribution this morning that he is still waiting for a reply 25 years after asking Treasury officials how to go about that. We do not know how to do it, because we cannot control the market. We know that some big players can spend billions if they think that the currency will go up or down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question was given by the right hon. Member for Caernarfon. Cutting 2 per cent. off interest rates would make it possible to manage the exchange rate down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we all know the futility of doing that. We would enter a spiral of difficulty. A 2 per cent. cut in interest rates would mean a significant effect on taxation and there would be many complex issues to take into account. I must admit that, if I were George Soros, the price of the euro now and the well-being of virtually all the economies that are part of euroland might persuade me that there was a case for a bit of a dabble in the euro. I think that it will make a comeback. [<i>Interruption</i>]. Unfortunately, I do not have enough to affect the market; I only wish that I had.<br><br>
Interest rates are significant and we cannot forget them. However, the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned other factors that are also beyond our control. I had in my constituency—it is now closed—a Bairdwear textile and clothing factory, most of the production of which was for Marks and Spencer. Marks and Spencer orders away from its supplier not because the factory was not providing quality goods but because it wanted to produce more cheaply abroad.<br><br>
Marks and Spencer's big mistake was to get its decisions on what customers would want out of line. Speaking to several of the company's women customers, I heard complaints that it was no longer producing the items that they wanted. Marks and Spencer made the bad decisions, not the producers of the clothes that it was selling in its shops. That has been a great tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we can counter the effect of events in Wales by informing the Welsh consumer of what such companies, especially Marks and Spencer, are doing? We should then let the consumers exercise their choice over what they buy. Jobs might return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I have not walked into Marks and Spencer since it announced the closure and I shall not in future, even though I had been a loyal customer. We must put pressure on companies to make them realise that they cannot depart willy-nilly and not expect backlash from consumers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
In the meantime, our Government are plainly trying to find alternative employment and to provide training for new skills so that people who lose their job can find a new one. In my constituency, overall unemployment is down by 19 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 17 per cent. and long-term unemployment by 11 per cent. That does not mean that we can rest on our laurels—there is still much more to do to ensure that the Welsh economy becomes more prosperous. We aim for the goal of full employment.<br><br>
I wish to consider the rural community. It was difficult to listen to the hon Member for Ribble Valley this morning and to have any feeling for the fact that BSE had arisen during the Tory years. On coming to power, we were left with a massive and difficult legacy. In stabilising the British economy, we have created problems for farmers regarding interest rates. We have made several gestures to help them, recognising that farming will survive not through increasing government subsidy but by developing economy ideas and measures for rural areas. We might do that through objective 1 status.<br><br>
I heard what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said about the problems in the Welsh Development Agency regarding rural development. I hope that the Assembly will listen to that argument and act. Our farming communities must be more ready to ally with food processing and to develop cooperatives. Several cooperative ventures have failed, but the strength of agriculture in countries such as France is based on the co-operative ventures that small farmers have pushed through. We must get used to doing that because that is how the rural economy can survive.<br><br>
The Government are successfully tackling the remaining problems in Wales, but we cannot rest on our laurels just because we are doing much better than the previous Government. We must do even better for the sake of the people of Wales.</span></p>
<p>4.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). I agreed with almost 99 per cent. of his contribution.<br><br>
I shall not spend too long on the farming industry, which was debated in the House on Thursday. Hon. Members with Welsh constituencies might not have been aware of that—only three of us were present. Most of the farming industry greeted the outcome of the common agricultural policy Berlin summit with considerable concern. Farmers are worried about modulation. For every pound that is modulated, £1 has to be given by the Chancellor. We in Wales know all about that pound. It is no wonder that the farming community is worried. According to the plans, modulation might harm the worse-off while benefiting the better-off—the larger farmers. No one wants that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised at the hon. Gentleman's comments. Does he not agree that it is better to have that small shift—many of us wanted it to be bigger—from money that is put into subsidy to money that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
put into long-term improvements? The increased money, with the help of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the Government, will enable the farming industry to become sustainable instead of depending on handouts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I obviously agree with that, but farming unions are concerned that the plans might hit the smaller farmer disproportionately and not affect the larger farmer, who might be better able to cope with the change. I do not think that modulation is wrong in essence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise that it is designed to protect hill farmers, who are particularly vulnerable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why, therefore, are the farming unions in Wales against it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The farming unions are in competition for membership. That is one reason why it is difficult to get a sensible debate on agriculture in Wales. It is possible to have sensible discussions in private with some leading union members, but it is much harder to achieve in public because they are so conscious of the competition between the unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There we are. I shall not pursue that further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman going to be awkward?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say unless the hon. Gentleman gives way, but the answer is yes. What is Plaid Cymru's position on modulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the party is in favour of it in principle, but I am not sure whether it is entirely happy with the most recent plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in favour of modulation. The problem, as my hon. Friend rightly said, is that the settlement might have an unfair impact on people on low earnings. None the less, the settlement brings in extra money to the industry, which is why we support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is where I started.<br><br>
I realise that it is all very well for Opposition parties to spread doom and gloom—no doubt the Government are tired of hearing their tales of woe—but there is undoubtedly a crisis in the rural areas of Wales. The aid package recently announced by the Government was of considerable assistance, but it dealt with the symptoms rather than the disease. Part of that disease is the strength of the pound, which bears disproportionately heavily on agriculture, as it does on manufacturing and on any other export-based business. Additionally, any moneys coming in from Brussels are devalued or worthless when they arrive. The strong pound hits very hard.<br><br>
The current CAP arrangements are scheduled to run until 2006. I am glad that the Government have conceded that there is a case for agrimonetary compensation, because there is a great divergence between the value of sterling and the value of the euro.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
However, the £66 million set aside for that compensation will not make a huge difference. The Government have tried to address the issue, but it is not good enough simply to throw money at the problem. We must adopt a more structured plan to set agriculture back on its feet. In some cases, it will be assisted by diversification.<br><br>
According to <i>The Times</i> last week, the industry has lost about £3 billion during the past few years. That is a huge amount of money to be lost, not only from the pockets of farmers but from the rural economy at large. Once the money has gone from the farmers' pockets, every other rural trader suffers as a result. During the farming summit, the Prime Minister admitted that, although a start had been made,
<br><blockquote><p>It will not end the painful restructuring of the industry that has seen so much hardship. But it will offer solutions to problems; it will set out a vision; and it will answer some of the key concerns.</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that vision has yet become apparent. We need an integrated rural strategy with a healthy agriculture industry at its core. We need the creation of work, diversification, sustainable transport and, as I have said many times, the relaxation of planning regulations. We need a vision in the form of an all-embracing package, with a healthy agriculture industry at its centre.<br><br>
Last week, I put a question to the Minister for the Environment about the possibility of the forthcoming White Paper proposing the relaxation of planning legislation to enable the sustainable development of small industrial enterprises. The answer that I received was most encouraging. I hope that we can take positive steps to ensure that the planners do not attempt to preserve rural life in aspic. It needs to grow, to diversify in some cases, and to adopt a new approach.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend was quite right in what he said about co-operatives. A co-operative approach is needed, and that is happening in some areas of Wales. Various co-operative organisations are now exporting sheep, for example. Such ventures are necessary not only for obvious economic reasons but to counterbalance the strength of the supermarkets. That problem remains to be tackled, despite the recent Office of Fair Trading report. Nothing has been done about the supermarkets' artificial strength in the marketplace, or about the way in which they hold the whip hand, call the shots and determine prices while our markets are closing down. We must tackle the supermarkets head on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks of positive Government initiatives. Does he welcome the Department of Trade and Industry's recent announcement that it is now prepared to let the three organisations that replaced Milk Marque go into vertical production, so that we can add value in our communities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is a shame that Milk Marque had to be split up, and some have argued that that was unnecessary. However, I agree entirely with what he says, and we look forward to progress being made.<br><br>

One of the main problems is, as I have said, the strength of the pound, which is making exporting very difficult. The dairy sector is a dead loss at the moment, and help is long overdue. I hope that the Government will listen to its desperate cries, because the strength of the pound also weighs heavily there. We must consider the overall package announced by the Government, consisting of business development, marketing grants and training programmes. That package will encourage farmers to do what they want to do—sell their goods in the marketplace at a competitive and proper price. Wales and the UK have the best available produce and we should be proud of it. Unfortunately, we currently lag behind in marketing terms as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman welcome the news that, from 12 June, there will be a major marketing initiative to promote use of the British mark on all agricultural products? That will help the consumer to make the right choices when buying such products.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman, but I have misgivings about the use of the British mark, although not on a political level. We should think in terms of Welsh beef, English beef, Scottish beef, and so on. About two years ago, I visited the Austrian ambassador and asked her to help in obtaining the lifting of the beef ban or, at least, to explain the stumbling blocks. Her response was interesting. She said, "Of course, you have the best product. It is reared on the hills, clean and environmentally friendly, but you should sell it as Welsh beef." She explained that, in Austria, people buy cheese not from, say, a valley but a town, because they want to know where the product is sourced and how it is produced. Such matters are of greater interest today than ever.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), I hope that the initiative to which he referred is successful, and that it is not a rerun of the Meat and Livestock Commission. Promoting the odd bit of British beef on television every now and then will not get us anywhere. There must be better targeting and there must be labelling. We should be proud of the places that produce these goods, whether they are in England, Scotland or Wales, but we should be prepared to label goods accordingly because that is what the market requires.<br><br>
Bureaucracy and red tape also weigh heavily on the farming sector, as does the huge burden imposed by the costs associated with environmental regulation. In fact, the industry in Wales is cleaner than that in most European countries. Moreover, we must consider not just the agricultural sector, but rural areas as a whole. For example, we must consider sustainable transport, and expansion in small and medium industries. In Bryncrug, a tiny village near Tywyn in the south of my constituency, there is a manufacturing plant that employs about 90 people. It makes a range of high-quality products in various metals, 99.9 per cent. of which it exports to the west midlands. Birmingham places the orders, which are sent to Tywyn for production. There is no problem—no one in Bryncrug has ever complained about associated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
noise, or the lorry or two that departs every day. The arrangement works, and I would like to see more of them. Rural areas in Wales must be living, working environments; they should not be preserved in aspic.<br><br>
Hitherto, my comments have been fairly uncontroversial, but my next point will cause members of the Committee to start jumping up and down. Committee members have trumpeted the strong economy, and it is true that the economy is booming. The Chancellor has between £17 billion and £20 billion in his coffers. Why, therefore, is that wealth not being redistributed? Why are pensioners being ignored? In a recent letter, Mr. Tom Moran told me:
<br><blockquote><p>The wealthiest fifth of Pensioners, who now pay Income Tax, will be marginally better off and the poorest fifth of Pensioners, in receipt of Income Support, will be minimally better off from April 2001 when the means-tested Minimum Income Guarantee rises by £3.55 to £82 per week. But the remaining three fifths of us receive only an increase in the Winter Fuel Payment next December and, for the over 75s, free TV licence from next November.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In my own case, as a 78-year-old Pensioner, in the financial year 2000/2001 I will receive the following increases per week … Increase in the Basic Pension … 75p (up to £67.50 per week) … Increase in Graduated and Additional Pension … 18p … Increase in Winter Fuel Pay … 48p … Free TV licence … 41p … GRAND TOTAL £1.82.</p></blockquote>
If we can achieve a strong economy that brings improvements I sincerely hope that we can—we must establish whether we are being fair to all sections of society. The word "socialist" has been used many times this morning. Pensioners are the first group of people whom any Government who profess to have an eye on socialist goals should consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would inform our debate if the hon. Gentleman explained not what has not been done but what he would like to be done that would enable us to put costings on his proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not fall head first into that. We are discussing the Government's programme and the current state of the Welsh economy, which is strong but not strong enough to give the poor man whose letter I quoted more than an additional £1.82 per week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman quotes one of my constituents, who yesterday gave evidence to the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs as part of our inquiry into social exclusion. Mr. Moran did not refer to a policy that was introduced within three years of the formation of this Labour Government, namely, an increase of £16 or £17 for the poorest pensioners through the minimum income guarantee. The Government have not received the credit that they deserve in that regard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may continue to receive Mr. Moran's vote, but, in the circumstances, I rather doubt it. The minimum income guarantee is a ceiling—it was previously called the benefits ceiling and it does not mean a great deal. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman should trumpet its benefits too loudly.<br><br>
One of the Administration's first acts in 1997 was to hand over responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England. The idea was to control inflation without

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
prejudice. Committee members today tried to pick holes in the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley). In 1997, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>I have some reservations about the Government's decision on the Bank of England, but I can see the benefits that come from financial policy that is made objectively. Employment should have been added to inflation as a criterion for the setting of bank rates, as is the case in the United States.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 May 1997; Vol. 312, c. 104.]</p></blockquote>
That observation was not made in preparation for this debate—it was made back in 1997. It is a shame that greater cognisance was not taken of his views—if it had been, we should not be in our present situation. The Government may be trying to hide behind the Monetary Policy Committee, but it was the Government who created that animal, and they have to stick by their creation. It must control inflation without prejudice, but its remit should have been wider.<br><br>
Wales, England and Scotland are on the borders of the euro zone and outside the dollar zone. The Chancellor of the Exchequer rightly said that he does not want to return to a stop-go policy. The economy is already in a stop-go situation—it is stop-go in relation to manufacturing because of the strength of the pound against the euro.<br><br>
The non-manufacturing sector, especially the service sector in Wales, has not caught up with the position in the rest of Britain. The service sector in Wales is underdeveloped, perhaps because it is so wide. We could take the steps that were described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon to deal with that problem.<br><br>
We should have been given a clearer signal about the euro. The longer that such indecision hangs over the head of industry, the longer industry will wallow in its current problems. The Chancellor says that we must improve productivity, and, of course, he is right. However, killing off businesses will not do it.<br><br>
The £22 billion raised by the sale of mobile phone licences was mentioned this morning. Some of that money should have been redirected to assist the development of rural infrastructure and other core services, and to give more needy areas the chance to create employment. That would have been true redistribution. The Government are caving in to the voters of middle England, and perhaps see the southeast as more important than other areas. A firm supporter of the Government said:
<br><blockquote><p>British business is in fact less regulated than its European competitors, according to a recent OECD survey. It is not the regulation that is forcing manufacturers out of business, it is the strong pound.</p></blockquote>
Those were the words of Lord Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>The real cause of the problems facing firms like Ford, Nissan, Toshiba and countless others is the persistent over-valuation of the pound. On Sunday, John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, warned against cheap imports and the way that economic policy is going.</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman hear a voter from southern England, a farmer from Kent, moan on the radio that he had a farm worth £2 million and an income of less than £7,000. There are not many farmers in Wales who could say that. He was asking for poor relief for millionaires. Plaid Cymru has this afternoon, for the first time ever, adopted a policy in opposition to the Farmers Union of Wales. Now that he accepts modulation, will the hon. Gentleman argue for the huge subsidies that go to rich farmers in the south of England and Norfolk to be redistributed to the tenant farmers in Wales, who are in genuine need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had listened to what I said, he would have realised that I was saying that I had misgivings about modulation on that basis. It may be that, as the situation stands, the better off will not be hit at all, and the people at the bottom of the pile, who really need help, will be hit disproportionately. That is what I am concerned about. Ultimately, there must be some form of modulation and we should find a proper formula for it, to ensure that there is redistribution and that the land is occupied by people who make a living from it. We need to have families living on the land. We need a burgeoning rural economy. I have no truck with millionaire farmers, any more than the hon. Gentleman does, but it is not an ideological thing. We should redistribute those moneys. That is the point that I was making.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Wales made no reference to tourism. I am concerned about that. Tourism is now the largest employer in Wales and is under considerable pressure, as a result not only of the value of the pound, but of uncompetitive VAT rates—an issue that has been raised time and time again. The First Secretary in Cardiff recently said that tourism in Wales is dying. I wrote to him eight weeks ago, asking him what he meant; I have yet to receive a response, but, no doubt, he will reply at some stage. I hope that he will also let us know what he thinks should be done. Tourism is an unsubsidised industry, employing as many people in Wales today as the coal industry did in its heyday. It is an important industry, and I cannot see why the right hon. Gentleman did not utter a single sentence about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of the Government's measures affect the whole of Wales, not just one particular sector. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the national minimum—wage one of the Government's major reforms—has enormous significance for the tourism industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that. However, regardless of such snippets, the Secretary of State cannot avoid the fact that he said not a word about tourism, agriculture or the rural economy in his opening speech this morning. That is most unfortunate. It underlines the belief of many rural dwellers that new Labour is more concerned with the south-east and with the popular vote in parts of England than with rural areas. That viewpoint will have been bolstered by the contributions of the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). The political

map of Wales will change considerably at the next general election, due partly to the fact that the Government are completely ignoring the rural economy. Today's debate has made that clear.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin, Mr. Jones, by offering you my personal congratulations on the statement by the Secretary of State for Defence about the procurement of at least 25 new heavy aircraft from the Airbus fleet. We are all delighted that your constituency will directly benefit from the production of the wings for that wonderful aircraft. Incidentally, it will also help the British Government to meet the requirement under the strategic defence review to provide a viable expeditionary force for this country.<br><br>
It is great news for your constituency, Mr. Jones, and great news for Wales, many other parts of which have a thriving aerospace industry. In my constituency we have the British Airways maintenance centre, which is the first centre in the world outside the Boeing company to provide facilities for the giant 777 Boeing aircraft. The British Airways avionics plants in Llantrisant and the defence aviation repair agency in St. Athan employ thousands of people in state of the art aerospace technology and skills. I hope that everyone concerned will unite to ensure the delivery of the project to the people of Wales and, if necessary, work to put together a package that includes assistance.<br><br>
I do not want to repeat anything that has been said during today's interesting and wide-ranging debate. However, I should like to focus on one or two aspects. Most important, whatever spin one puts on it, or whatever measure one uses, the Welsh economy is doing incredibly well. The latest edition of Cardiff business school's Welsh economic review makes extremely good reading. The Welsh economy is in a better position than it has been for many decades—certainly better than at any time during the 18 years of the previous Tory Government. The Welsh economic review predicts growth across the Welsh economy of 2 per cent. this year and 2.1 per cent. next year and the year after that. We have low inflation, high growth and a stable economic environment. That bodes well for the Welsh economy.<br><br>
However, one major challenge must be addressed. We inherited a structural deficit from the previous Government. In Wales, gross domestic product per capita stands at 82.3 per cent. of the United Kingdom average. That sets us back in terms of our ability to grow at a rate that puts us on a par with the rest of the UK. The Welsh Development Agency identified that in its corporate plan. Its ambition over the next 10 years is to bring Wales up to 90 per cent. of the average gross domestic product per capita in the United Kingdom. I do not think that that is good enough: we should strive for nothing less than equity with the rest of the United Kingdom. To achieve that, we would have to realise a growth rate of no less than 4 per cent. for the next 10 years, because of the horrendous legacy left by the Tories. That is a big challenge and it would be a phenomenal achievement. I am optimistic that, even if we cannot achieve that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
amount of growth, we can go some way towards it, but we must face up to a number of issues if we are to succeed.<br><br>
One problem that we have in Wales, certainly in my experience, and it came out in the brilliant speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), is our poor business image, which acts as a barrier to new investment. We want rapid growth in GDP. We want to build a big, private sector, capital base, because at present it falls so far behind the rest of the United Kingdom. One hon. Member has already referred to Hyder, which was our biggest holder of private capital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend note that one positive development is that the new chief executive has accepted the general view that Hyder should be pronounced in the Welsh way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that, after many years, that issue has now been resolved. I used the anglicised version, because at one time it was the company's policy to use that version of what I think was originally a Greek word. However, I accept my right hon. Friend's correction and shall use the Welsh pronunciation from now on.<br><br>
Hyder was our largest company. Possibly only two other publicly quoted companies—TBI and Iceland, the food chain—are large Welsh holders of private capital. If we are to achieve those growth rates for future investment, we cannot depend entirely on public subsidy, such as the £5 billion surplus from the Treasury's revenue account or objective 1 money. We must build our capital base in Wales if we are to succeed, and the only way to do that is to create the right environment to attract the right kind of investment into Wales and remove some of the existing barriers to investment.<br><br>
One of those barriers is image. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State came close to making the mistake of seeing Wales as a country still dominated by heavy industry—steel making and the automotive industry. The reality is different. What manufacturing base we have is 30 per cent. of our total industry and very diverse. More than 400 transnational companies operate in manufacturing industry, almost exclusively for export to Europe. Over 100 of those companies are American owned. I have referred to the aerospace industry. There is also the automotive industry, we have a fine tradition in steel, and there is still a deep mine in south Wales and a small but thriving coal industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend also recognise the tremendous contribution of Japanese companies in Wales? There are now 56 Japanese companies working in Wales. We owe them tremendous gratitude for helping the Welsh economy, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, and we pay tribute to the WDA's work in securing that investment 56 Japanese companies are currently located in Wales. We owe them tremendous gratitude for having helped the Welsh economy, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, and we should pay tribute to the WDA's work in securing that investment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely, and that points us in the right direction to find solutions and mechanisms to stimulate the growth of the Welsh economy. The Japanese are second only to the Americans.<br><br>
The Welsh Development Agency succeeded dramatically in attracting direct foreign investment to Wales over a considerable period. However, it failed in attracting UK domestic investment to Wales over the same period. That is precisely why the Welsh economy declined and wealth creation decreased in Wales but continued to grow in Scotland, to the point at which the Scottish economy's GDP per capita is on a par with that of the rest of the UK. That is where the difference lies. In fact, we outperformed Scotland in 18 of 20 years in attracting foreign investment, but we came nowhere near Scotland in attracting UK domestic investment.<br><br>
That is one of the big challenges that we face in the coming years. We must attract our fair share of UK investment, in manufacturing industry in particular, but in the Welsh economy in general. The biggest barrier to such investment is, I hate to say, the attitudes of many of the London and UK-based investment markets, which still perceive Wales as dominated by slag heaps and smoking chimneys. That is not an accurate reflection of our country. We have a diverse manufacturing base, although I agree that we have far too many assembly plants compared with engineering plants and higher value-added and higher skill workplaces, which, as other hon. Members have said, is a target for which we must aim. We have a diverse economy, not one dominated by the old heavy industries that for many years brought a lot of wealth and prosperity to our country.<br><br>
If we continue to be perceived as a region dominated by steel and coal, we shall not break down those barriers, and we shall not attract additional investment to Wales. That is a challenge for the House and the newly formed Welsh Assembly. One reason why I was a great supporter of the creation of the Welsh Assembly and of devolution was precisely that problem. I thought that, for the first time, we would have a platform that would allow us to break down the barriers that we face in projecting an image of Wales and portray to the rest of the world as well as to those nearer home the opportunities that exist in our country.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the argument about marketing Welsh lamb in Austria. That is all well and good where markets exist that perceive a separate country and a separate product. I support any measure designed to market such high-quality products and develop niche markets, but first we must register ourselves on the Richter scale and get the message across that a place called Wales exists with wonderful investment opportunities and good agriculture. The image problem is one of the biggest that we confront, and we must overcome it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am staggered by some of the hon. Gentleman's comments about industry not investing in Wales because of a perception of slag heaps and old industries. Is he saying that the Welsh Development Agency is not doing its job in selling Wales properly?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not listening. I said that the WDA did an exceptionally good job in attracting foreign investment from the rest of the world. What it could not do was attract investment closer to home. We do not have a great deal of time in which to develop those points in great detail, but the findings are based on much research done over a considerable period. They clearly illustrate that we cannot attract the level of investment over the Severn bridge and down the A55 corridor that we could and should be achieving, given the strengths of the Welsh economy.<br><br>
We have not discussed the problem of transport infrastructure within Wales. We must get that right, because one of the most important considerations of any new investor coming into Wales is access to markets. If we have inadequate access via road, rail or air—a point that I recently made in an Adjournment debate—we will continue to have problems. I will not make any more arguments for Cardiff airport, which is Wales' only international airport and a vital asset for the economy, other than to say that the construction of adequate road access to that airport is vital for not only the airport and my constituency, but the Welsh economy as a whole. If hon. Members have a chance, they should consider those arguments.<br><br>
We must get the transport balance right if we are to develop a strong economy; we cannot simply force everybody off the roads and on to rail. We must develop an integrated transport system, but we also must listen to the voice of business when we develop our strategies. That should be a major priority. We need to examine the transport bottlenecks in certain parts of the Welsh economy, one of which is the link to Cardiff international airport, and remove them.<br><br>
I should like to address the question of strategic development and strategic economic policy. I believe passionately that the economy is strong, and that some parts of Wales provide some of the most attractive investment locations in western Europe, particularly the M4 corridor in the south and the A55 corridor in the north. However, to be able to exploit the economy's strengths we must recognise that three or four separate economies exist in Wales, which offer different products to potential investors. Whatever strategy we develop should fully recognise that.<br><br>
I flag up my concern about the direction that is being taken with job creation; although it is well intentioned, it could be misguided and damaging. If we develop policy guidelines that say that 50, 60 or 80 per cent. of all new net additional jobs must go into particular areas in Wales—be they objective 1 areas, west Wales or wherever—we will be in danger of losing jobs and investment that we should not lose. One cannot direct global investors in today's environment as one could 10, 20 or 30 years ago; one must create an environment to make the investment offer attractive, and listen to what potential investors are looking for. We should grab the investment opportunities that we can with both hands, and exploit the strengths in our economy.<br><br>
The big challenge facing Wales will come from the creation of regional development agencies throughout the United Kingdom and, in particular, the London
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0487">Image</span>

development board, which will have a budget almost double that of the WDA in its first year of operation. Given that fact, it will be a challenge to attract our fair share of investment. The answer is to look to the 400 international companies that already operate out of our country to see if we can harness their resources and contacts to help us to promote Wales.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just under three years ago, at one of the first meetings that I attended in the House of Commons, in the Jubilee Room, I was handed a list of 300 Celtic societies from around the world. I marvelled at it and thought of the business and cultural opportunities that it could provide for the people of Wales. I knocked on a few doors with the idea, but it did not get taken up. In January, I attended a meeting in the WDA offices in St. Asaph with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to launch Business WebWales, which was being masterminded by a company called Hicks Randles from Mold. I explained to its representative Roger Guest that the list had been lying in my office for two and a half years and that nothing had been done with it. Mr. Guest immediately saw the business opportunities of using the list to develop not only cultural but economic networks throughout Wales.<br><br>
The Welsh diaspora has been going on since 1170, when Madoc, a prince in north Wales, went to America—300 hundred years before Columbus. The diaspora has continued right up to modern times, with Catherine Zeta Jones going off to California. My family has also taken part in the diaspora: one sister left at the age of 18 and has been living in Dallas for 22 years, while another left 10 years ago and is living in Boston.<br><br>
An estimated 2 million people of Welsh ancestry live in America, and that takes no account of the other countries that Britain colonised over 200 or 300 years. Several groups have maintained links with Welsh people abroad. There is Single, Welsh and Sexy—SUS. I tried to apply for membership, but I qualified on only one ground—that I was Welsh. There are also the Young Welsh Americans, the Welsh North American chamber of commerce and the Wales International, which I commend on its sterling work over many years. I shall circulate its publication, <i>Yr Enfys,</i> to hon. Members, although many of them will know of its activities already. There is also the London Welsh Association, and there are 300 St. David's societies throughout the world.<br><br>
If we could tap into that fantastic cultural network, we could produce extra dynamism for the Welsh economy. The Irish have done something similar for 200 years and used their expatriate community to ensure that their economy was kept bubbling during the lean years of the 40s, 50s and 60s. They exploit to the hilt their extensive network in America and other countries. Recently, the Welsh Affairs Committee visited poverty-stricken areas in Dublin. Dublin college has a unit that rings around rich Irish-Americans to ask for funding, and the college is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
partly funded by such donations. About 15 years ago, the Irish Government established genealogy centres in every county. The parish records of births, marriages and deaths were put into computers by young people on the dole. Those records were then used as a hook to attract Irish visitors to Ireland to investigate their heritage and spend money in the Irish economy. Scotland has taken steps to copy what has gone on in Ireland.<br><br>
Wales is being given a unique opportunity to do likewise. With the advent of devolution, we can capitalise on our Welsh identity. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, we need to brand Wales. We need to develop our heritage and culture in Wales and throughout the world. Objective I funding will give us the finance to do that.<br><br>
The greatest opportunity will come with computers. They will give us access to Welsh communities at the press of a button. We shall not have to spend money on hefty postage fees, and we shall have instantaneous access to millions of people of Welsh ancestry around the world. It can be done. My father was an Irishman, so I am half Irish. I have a booklet at home with the exact addresses of every Ruane alive on the planet—1,500 of them. They have been found by trawling through directories in Ireland, South Africa and America. That technology is 10 years old. If we could use it to discover where those Welsh people live, finding out their e-mail addresses to contact them, we could open fantastic business opportunities in Wales.<br><br>
Two months ago, I wrote to the 300 groups of Welsh societies in America and other countries, through Hicks Randles and Celtec, the local training and enterprise council. I have had a fantastic response so far. This morning I received two replies: one from Nansi Cox of the Canadian Welsh Singers, Cantorian Cymraeg Canada, and the other from Miss Pamela Russell of the Auckland Welsh club. Replies are still coming in. There is tremendous enthusiasm for developing such concepts in Wales, which we should do also for economic reasons. We could use Welsh concepts to set up an interface among Welsh producers. I am thinking especially of young people who may leave Wales—artists, designers and craftspeople who are proud of Wales but cannot make ends meet there. If we could give them the names and addresses of those 2 million Welsh contacts, many of them could sell their products abroad.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned tourism. Heritage and genealogy could be used as the hook to attract people back to Wales. The potential for Welsh tourism could be fantastic. Putting parish records and newspapers' births, marriages and deaths columns on computer could be useful in attracting Welsh people back to Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The national library of Wales in Aberystwyth has already conducted such computerisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There have been a number of initiatives—including a key one that I found out about only recently. I will come to them in a moment. On the tourism point, we could

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
help coach operators, hotels, guest houses, restaurants and farm houses.<br><br>
There is a great opportunity out there for language tourism. In my constituency, there is Canolfan Iaith, a centre of excellence for the teaching of the Welsh language. It could benefit directly from such contacts. The Welsh Development Agency has already developed a formal structure in six cities in north America. There are two branches in California, one in Ontario, Boston and Chicago, and another in Dallas, which opened only three weeks ago.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) reminded us of the importance of American companies in Wales. There are 143 American companies in the Principality, which have invested £5 billion since 1983. As a result of investment overseas, 75,000 people have been employed in Wales—31,000 of them as a result of American investment. If we build on that informal American structure, using those Welsh societies, we are more likely to make a success of the enterprise.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the work of the WDA in America and ask it to assist us when the Welsh Affairs Committee visits America on 11 June. We hope to team up with the agency in Chicago and trust that it will give us all possible help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that last Thursday I and other hon. Members attended a reception at the American embassy hosted by the WDA and the American ambassador to promote the very ideals of which he has spoken?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not aware of that. Six weeks ago I telephoned the American ambassador and asked him to take part in some publicity. In fact, we gave him a letter to pass on to his local Welsh society in South Carolina, where he comes from. I look forward to working with the American embassy to promote Welsh produce.<br><br>
I should like to refer to another success story, related in a recent article in the <i>Daily Post.</i> Mr. David Williams is a Welshman born, as I was, in St. Asaph. He is also the same age as me and has the same number of children who are the same age as mine. He may even have been in the same maternity ward at the same time. He has invested a lot of time and effort in establishing a Welsh north American chamber of commerce. As the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) said, initiatives have been set up by the national library of Wales, the American embassy and many other groups.<br><br>
We should aim for co-ordination and a strategy to ensure that the diverse Welsh groups in Wales and abroad capitalise on the many opportunities, both culturally and economically. We should use our formal and informal international links to develop our culture and economy to the full.</span></p>
<p>5.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued by the secretary of State's opening speech. He gave us a good news story but he was somewhat selective, if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
not seductive, in some of his tales. He made no mention of rural industries, tourism or the vast service sector. Any problems could apparently be attributed either to the high pound or the low euro, or to the previous Conservative Government. His speech was very much a case of, "Not me, guv", but his Government must take responsibility for the current situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may have slipped the hon. Gentleman's mind. Given that the previous Administration spent all their 18 years blaming everything that went wrong on the previous Labour Government. Given that, is it not cheeky of him and his hon. Friends to criticise us when we are only a matter of years into what I hope will be an equally long period, but of far more successful Labour Governments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that throughout those 18 years we constantly blamed that appalling Labour Government who were in office from 1974 to 1979. The Secretary of State cannot claim that falls in inflation, unemployment and interest rates are attributable to a Labour Government and that all the problems belong to someone else.<br><br>
I should like to look at some of the problems facing the Welsh economy today and seek some answers from the Government. I am indebted to the Welsh Development Agency's latest corporate plan, "Promoting Prosperity", which a number of hon. Members will have seen. The evidence that I shall quote is therefore not mine or the Conservative party's but from the Government's own agency. In looking through the document and the WDA's assessment of the Welsh economy, some key points emerge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Welsh Development Agency is the Government's own agency: I know that he is from Dorset, but it is the Welsh Assembly's agency. It has no relationship with the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Development Agency was a creation of Government and has been the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly for less than a year. We cannot suggest that it is somehow nothing to do with the Government. That is another example of "Not me, guv". One telling quotation from the document is that
<br><blockquote><p>Wales remains close to the bottom of the British regional prosperity league and forecasts predict that GDP in Wales will grow at a slower rate than the UK average in the period to 2001. This prosperity gap is typically expressed in terms of GDP per head, but it is equally evident in other prosperity indicators such as average incomes and earnings in real terms.</p></blockquote>
The Welsh Development Agency cites several reasons for the continuing prosperity gap, the first of which is industrial structure. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>For most of the past decade, manufacturing and output in Wales has outperformed the UK. Indeed, Wales is one of the few UK (or indeed EU) regions to have increased its manufacturing employment over this period.</p></blockquote>
I hope that hon. Members will take note that, for most of the past decade, there was a Conservative Government, not a Labour Government. The WDA goes on:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
<br><blockquote><p>Two key factors explain this: the increasingly efficient large-scale production of steel and aluminium, and inward investment…Restructuring around infrastructure development, financial incentives, the attraction of foreign capital has not, however, narrowed the GDP gap—</p></blockquote>
with the test of the United Kingdom—
<br><blockquote><p>It is the performance of other parts of the economy, especially in tradeable services, that underlies Wales' relatively weak industrial structure.</p></blockquote>
The WDA's second point is about low demand. It states that Wales can reverse its relative decline only by growing at a faster rate than current demand levels allow. Given the lack of local control over the macro-economic environment, that can be achieved only by shifting the focus of business into trade with the rest of the UK as well as overseas—a point also made by the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan.<br><br>
The WDA's third point is about low activity rates. There are fewer people, both men and women, at work in Wales than in any other region in the United Kingdom. The problem is especially acute for manual workers. Identifying and overcoming the obstacles to work and creating new work opportunities will be essential to increase prosperity.<br><br>
The fourth point is low wage levels. Wales was second from bottom in the United Kingdom regional earnings league in 1998, with average earnings 10 per cent. below the United Kingdom average.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to the problem of low wages in Wales. Will he show his support for the national minimum wage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walters) responds, may I tell the Committee that several hon. Members who have sat through the entire debate want to participate in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. I hope you will note that I have sat through the entire debate as well as the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards).<br><br>
The WDA's most important point is what it describes as the enterprise deficit. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>The WDA analysis indicates that enterprise development in Wales is lagging behind the UK.</p></blockquote>
The consequence of that deficit is that small and medium enterprises are underperforming in several crucial respects: in new firm formation, innovation, research and development, investment in physical and human capital, and international trade. WDA research shows that only a small proportion of those small and medium businesses have high growth and hence economic development potential. It attributes that to shortage of marketing skills, lack of information and weak networks, motivation and culture and the demand and supply of finance. The WDA reaches five conclusions, to which the Government or the Welsh Assembly, must respond. They are as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>Given the existing conditions, policies and expectations, the "prosperity gap" will continue to widen.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Demand deficiency is a major part of the economic problem in Wales; Supply-side policies can help but Wales does not have control of its macro-economic environment. </p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Wales has a continuing over-reliance on slow growth…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Too few people of working age are at work in Wales.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Enterprise continues to be far too under-developed.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
The people of Wales will expect a response to those conclusions from the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<p>5.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not recognise my Wales in the speech of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), perhaps because I live there and represent a Welsh constituency.<br><br>
Before the previous election, the Labour party promised to work hard with business to create jobs and a strong economy. Three years on, I wish to place on record my grateful thanks to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his team for the safe way in which he has steered the British economy, so that people of all ages in my constituency have seen and felt the benefits. The Government's programme for economic stability and low inflation is helping more people into work. Overall, unemployment in Conwy has reduced by 19 per cent. since May 1997.<br><br>
Our commitment to getting young people off benefit and into work, providing them with the dignity that every young person deserves, means that the number of young people on the dole in Conwy has fallen by 75 per cent. We have given them hope, when previously they were in despair. Since May 1997, long-term unemployment in my constituency has fallen by a record 52 per cent. Earlier this year, we experienced another example of how Wales benefits from sound policies. From the 15 employment zones launched by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, two of them—the heads of the valleys and Caerphilly and the north-west Wales zones—are in Wales. They will target individuals aged more than 25 years who have been unemployed for more than 12 months.<br><br>
The National Assembly has announced that it will contribute £750,000 over two years to that initiative. Jobseekers can access personal job accounts worth up to £5,000 in some areas to help them find jobs, gain the right skills and set up a small firm. The new approach was trailed in five prototype zones, including that in north-west Wales. The trails showed that unemployed people were twice as likely to find and keep a job if they were in an employment zone than in other comparable areas. I am sure that my colleagues in north-west Wales join me in welcoming that initiative.<br><br>
In its first year, the National Assembly has created and safeguarded thousands of jobs and secured hundreds of millions of pounds of new investment in the Welsh economy. In building a world-class economy, we must make full use of the European objective 1 status that was secured by the Labour Government. I am sure that we all rejoice in noting that the timetable for starting objective 1 is on time. The programme to deliver that money is on target and the estimates for the first year of match funding are on budget. That is all just as we promised on day one.<br><br>
I represent a constituency that relies heavily on tourism and I welcome the Government's strategy for tourism, which sets ambitious targets for job creation, investment and visitor numbers. I want to mention one particular tourist attraction in Conwy—the smallest house in Great Britain. It can be found on the quay in the beautiful town of Conwy. Next Friday, we shall be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
celebrating the centenary of the leaving of the house by the last tenant. That is an important milestone in its history. It was almost demolished 100 years ago, because it and others in Conwy were not considered fit for human habitation. It was too small; it had no amenities. The great grandfather of the present owner, Miss Margaret Williams, opened the house to the public and thousands of people visit it each year. For such tourist attractions to succeed, however, we need adequate transport systems and particularly a good train service.<br><br>
That brings me to my current concern. First North Western has promised new trains to replace the 40-year-old stock that we have had to endure for far too long. It promised that their introduction would coincide with the summer timetable at the end of the month. However, according to a newspaper report, that might not happen, as Railtrack has not yet issued a clearance certificate. Here in Westminster a couple of weeks ago, the managing director of First North Western assured me that the promise would be kept. I now have my doubts.<br><br>
It is imperative that we have the new trains as planned, and not late because of a lack of communication among rail companies. I ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to do all that he can to support my campaign to ensure that those trains are on track for the summer timetable. The appalling condition of trains in use is a disgrace, and gives tourists the wrong impression of our beautiful north Wales. The National Assembly has allocated an extra £750,000 to increase rail services from north to south Wales. That is extremely good news for us in north Wales.<br><br>
Some small companies in my constituency rely on exporting their manufactured goods to Europe, and the weak euro is affecting them. For the long-term success and stability of those businesses, it would be unwise to follow the Opposition parties' advice on quick fixes that would gain popularity. We want a proper solution that allows businesses to plan with confidence. I do not wish us to pursue policies that could lead to a recession. We must work together on the shared agenda, so that those businesses have a stable future of which we can be proud. I had my penny's worth last week when I met the Governor of the Bank of England. I hope that he listened to me, and I look forward to some exciting announcements.</span></p>
<p>5.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with two points. The problems in manufacturing have been thoroughly discussed today, and most of the issues that I wanted to raise have already been mentioned, but I particularly want to refer to the problems in my constituency during the past two months. They started with the closure of the Marks and Spencer distribution unit in Pentwyn—Marks and Spencer has been mentioned—and continued with the announced closures of the car component factories of Aeroquip and Alloyd Wheels, which have been affected by various events. Those announcements were made soon after the first bad news about Rover, but the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
management of those companies assured me that Rover's difficulties contributed only a little to their problems, which were mainly caused by a general move out of this country by the headquarters of the car-making companies, whose number has now decreased to six from about 20. Rationalisation in the car industry has affected car suppliers, and my constituency has been badly hit.<br><br>
I want to talk about the position of women in the Welsh economy. In the most successful economies, such as those of the United States and Scandinavia, more women participate in the work force than in the United Kingdom. In Wales, 67 per cent. of women work, compared with 77 per cent. of men. Kate Bennett of the Equal Opportunities Commission graphically described the situation to the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. More women than men work part-time. Full-time women workers earn 84 per cent. of men's earnings, and part-time women workers earn 61 per cent. of men's earnings. Low wages in Wales are concentrated in part-time jobs usually done by women. That is why many women in Wales have benefited from the minimum wage, which has raised the salaries of 109,000 people. It is one of the Government's great achievements, and a huge step forward. Most of those who have benefited have been women, whose wages have, on the whole, increased by a third. That helps everybody in all parts of society in Wales. The other problem is that jobs remain segregated by sex. Women's jobs are still concentrated in the lower-paid service industries. There has been a big increase in modern apprenticeships, which have been successful, and there will be more of those. However, they are all strictly divided along gender lines and the wages that people receive in those jobs set the pattern for the future earnings of men and women.<br><br>
My other significant point is that 89 per cent. of fathers with young children work, compared to 52 per cent. of mothers. The mother still looks after the children up to the age of five years; she is still the main carer. All the research shows that that is related to a lack of child care facilities. Child care is an economic issue and an important part of a debate on the Welsh economy, because it is linked to releasing the potential of all our citizens.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was scathing this morning about parental leave. However, it is important that the Government want to have family-friendly policies that will involve everyone in the work force. We are all aware of the issues relating to small businesses. We should consider how we can find a way through those problems, not deride policies that are intended to reach everybody in the work force. The hon. Gentleman's words were not to be commended. We must try to overcome the problems. If we are to ensure that there is a successful economy in Wales, everyone in the work force must be involved—and I particularly stress women's involvement.</span></p>
<p>5.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Secretary of State said, Wales is not actually collapsing. However, we have rehearsed effectively
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0491">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
the concerns about farming—especially dairy and small farms, where there is a crisis—and manufacturing. We have also focused on the textile industry, which is particularly important to my constituency, where Laura Ashley still resides.<br><br>
The Secretary of State also spoke about the issue that is now almost debilitating for many exporting industries—the strength of the pound. He is right to point out that a strong pound is indicative of a strong economy. However, that does not resolve the issue for those who are being priced out of the international market as a result of relatively cheap imports and relatively expensive exports, which ours have become.<br><br>
In fairness, I think that there are some effective initiatives. One initiative—my party should perhaps have been a little more positive about this across the UK—was the new deal, which has been successful. I have seen individuals who were pretty much on the scrapheap of youth unemployment being rehabilitated; they now have successful jobs. Therefore, in the spirit of honesty, I think that some initiatives have been successful.<br><br>
However, the Government and Labour in Wales have not been equally successful in some matters. Indeed, in <i>The Times</i> of Thursday 20 April, Graham Searjeant criticised new Labour for raiding what he called "the golden goose" with regard to Hyder. He says that the payouts to the City
<br><blockquote><p>killed utilities' defence against Gordon Brown's punitive utility levy, gleefully announced soon after the election. He chose the formula worst for Hyder. The utility levy took £280 million, more than Wales's fair share of a tax that the Chancellor said utilities could well afford. Between them, the City and the Chancellor removed more than £400 million from Hyder, effectively half the business.</p></blockquote>
That is one matter on which the Government could have done better and one of the few on which I agreed with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans).<br><br>
Whether the £22 billion from phone licences was rightly used to repay debt is more of a debating point. It is a question not of principle, but of practice. No one could accuse the Chancellor of being imprudent by choosing to repay the investment. However, there was space to do that and also to invest in public services because, as we all know, a substantial war chest is being saved up for the next election. Perhaps the Government could have been a little more generous from that.<br><br>
It is clear from what Plaid Cymru said that its members still feel strongly about objective 1, as we all do. However, let us remember that objective 1 is not the end in itself, but the means to an end. I am sometimes worried that it is used, somewhat opportunistically, as a political battering ram, which does not always serve the best interests of Wales.<br><br>
I listened with great interest as the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) developed an ever more complex economic policy. It became clear that his economic policy for Wales extended well into regional government for England. His sympathy for our devolutionary policies is confirmation that the convergence criteria for Plaid Cymru to return to our fold are well in place, not least because I seem to bump increasingly into Plaid Cymru conferences in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas).<br><br>
The contribution made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley was almost a comic turn. He is quick to make fun of those who, for whatever reason, cannot always spend the full duration of the debate in the Room. However, he has done a good rendition of the hokey-cokey, coming in and out throughout the debate. It is a nice day outside. Judging by his increasingly mad contributions—I hope that I can get away with that—I suspect that he has spent too much time in the sun when not in the Room. He talked about a Conservative legacy of which to be proud. By 1997, the milk marketing board had been destroyed. BSE was on the cards and was destroying the farming community. There had been a salmonella scare. The number of small business failures represented an all-time record. If one is a Conservative it is easy to pretend that those things did not happen, but there was a larger differential between incomes in Wales and in the rest of the United Kingdom in 1997 than in 1979.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman bragged about the small number of businesses that went bust, but we know that that simply was not accurate. He even slammed paternity leave. That policy does not require him to become a father, nor to leave his job in Parliament. It is a choice for individuals, although I accept that we must ensure that small businesses do not suffer inordinately by losing key workers. He also set himself up as the spokesperson for small business. I have the honour of having run a small business almost as badly as the Conservatives used to run the country, so I am in a good position to say that they did nothing for me when I ran that business. In fact, they nearly drove me to bankruptcy. The hon. Gentleman also had the audacity to criticise the so-called hidden taxes. I have my complaints about indirect taxation, but let us remember that there were 22 tax increases under the Tories, which largely lost them the last election. The hon. Gentleman also said that pensioners had suffered, but it was the Tories who introduced VAT on fuel.<br><br>
I am coming to the best bit now. The hon. Gentleman said that many people were looking forward to a Conservative Government. The people in Romsey are not. I had to get that in. One of the lessons of Romsey was that people had not forgotten the list of disasters caused by the Conservative Government. A sobering thought is that Ribble Valley is far less safe for the Tories than Romsey was. I thought that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley would enjoy that. I shall send him a postcard when he leaves.<br><br>
We all agree that we need a stable economy that grows faster than that of the rest of the UK so that we can catch up. We also need visionary entrepreneurial skills and self-confidence. Wales is not as self-confident as it should be. A few suggestions that the Liberal Democrats will pursue in the Assembly and in the House include the idea of an enterprise development bank, so that venture capital is seen as a major opportunity instead of a major barrier. Wales is significantly under-represented in terms of venture
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0492">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
capital, and I hope that the establishment of a Welsh development bank as a possible solution to the finance gap will be taken seriously by Ministers.<br><br>
Another idea is a community investment authority to rectify the shortfall in funding between what might be called social capital and the opportunities that exist. For perhaps as little as £5 million we could pump-prime social enterprises to transform the voluntary economy, which we often forget. The Welsh Development Agency needs to work proactively with the Assembly to ensure that its targets and those under the national economic development strategy are the same, as there seem to be some differences. The Welsh Development Agency must also fulfil its self-proclaimed and correct role as one of the champions of objective 1. It must ensure a marriage of philosophy and strategy between its ambitions and those of the Assembly.<br><br>
It has been an interesting and entertaining debate. More than anything, we need to recognise that the three political parties represented by members of the Committee need to set aside the temptation for party political battering that occasionally occurs and to which I alluded in the objective 1 debate. If, as I have said before, politics is a competition rather than a war or a marathon, it is sometimes appropriate for us to run side by side. If the ideas of the Liberal Democrats are interesting to Ministers and others, I hope that they too will be embodied in the evolving work of those members of the Committee who care about creating a successful Welsh economy. If that happens, we will serve the people of Wales in all walks of life, who elected us to represent them. Most importantly in the light of our debate on the economy, they will thank us for having put the public above party politics.</span></p>
<p>5.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and enjoyable debate. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) highlighted the fact that members of the Committee are united by detestation of the policies of the Conservative party—the party of the hon. Members for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and for North Dorset (Mr. Walter)—over the past 20 years.<br><br>
We have had a full and positive debate, with contributions from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey), my right hon. friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), my hon. friends the Members for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane), for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) and for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan), the hon. Members for Ribble Valley and for North Dorset the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and the hon Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). I hope that we are able to take the positive ideas forward, in a spirit of co-operation, while recognising the great political divides and differences between us.<br><br>
The Government have set out a series of key targets and tasks to establish a strong economy in Wales and I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
make no apology for echoing the support of my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for them. We want to achieve prosperity by closing the productivity gap and to develop educational opportunity. We also want an anti-poverty strategy in the economy and strong public services. Members of the Committee, from all parties, have voiced many of those objectives and demands. I particularly welcome the positive messages, such as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend on the strengths of the economy in Wales.<br><br>
There is much good news in the Welsh economy. My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy mentioned the employment zones in her constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymnet (Mr. Rowlands). Through the new deal, the Government have achieved the 1997 targets of moving 13,000 people into jobs in Wales. Unemployment in Wales has been reduced by 54 per cent. and youth unemployment by more than two thirds. Construction jobs in Wales have increased by 60 per cent. since the general election. Wales now exports 10 per cent. more goods than it imports. Inward investment, the need for which was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clywd in strong terms, has improved dramatically since the general election. In the last year of the previous Government's tenure, overlapping into the first year of ours, inward investment totalled £334 million. This year, there was £547 million of inward investment into Wales. That is all good news and those are all positive stories. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd said, the discussion between the Welsh Development Agency and the American ambassador on Thursday last week centred on positive news. There is a good story to tell about the economy in Wales, without denying the fact that there are diffcult issues which we need to address and which the right hon. Member for Caernarfon highlighted today. Members from all parties share concern about those important issues.<br><br>
There are a range of such issues. I welcome debate on the rural economy and tourism—raised by hon. Members today—and on manufacturing industries. One year into the devolution settlement, we are already beginning to see the fruits of the partnership between between the National Assembly, the Government and the European Community. I was most interested to hear the right hon. Member for Caernarfon mention that partnership, as his arguments were destroyed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli. Clearly, the right hon. Gentleman ultimately wants one of the three tenets of partnership of the Assembly, Europe and the British Government to be removed from the economic development proposal. I listened with great interest to my right hon. Friend's contribution. Every word that he said about how nationalism could destroy jobs, services and the strength of the economy has been vindicated in this debate.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have mentioned the rural economy, which raises extremely important issues. I hope that I can touch on them in the time that remains. Positive action has been taken. The Government have held a farm summit, and have put additional resources into the rural economy. The

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
Government, and the Prime Minister personally, sent out strong messages from the farm summit about diversification and support for the industry. The hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, the right hon. Member for Caernarfon and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend all mentioned the importance of agriculture. Clearly, the rural economy must be addressed, but we must also consider other issues. The working families tax credit, the Government's encouragement of e-commerce and the improvement of a range of social benefits all benefit the rural economy as well as the urban economy. I hope that hon. Members of all parties will recognise that the Government have taken the issue seriously, are trying to rectify a difficult legacy and are advancing positive proposals.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Clwyd and for Conwy mentioned the importance of tourism, which I do not decry. It brings important wealth to Wales, and attracts not just external visitors but day trippers. It is important to our community, and the Government support it.<br><br>
The Government have made a great commitment to the manufacturing industry. As has been mentioned, the loan of £530 million to British Aerospace is an important central government contribution. To echo the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli, Wales would not have benefited from that if it were the independent state that the right hon. Member for Caernarfon wants it to be. It would not be possible to undertake and develop that scale of support.<br><br>
The announcement on future large aircraft—which was made in the House of Commons only two and a half hours ago by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence—is a great achievement and commitment by the Government. I want to pay tribute to you, Mr. Jones, for your steadfast work in support of that cause in north Wales and elsewhere. Twenty-five aircraft will be purchased, and a further 3,500 long-term high-skill jobs could be created in north-east Wales, Bristol and Prestwick. In terms of indirect employment, 10,000 jobs could be created in relation to future large aircraft. The delegations that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
you have led, and the pressures borne, will show that this Government are committed to manufacturing industry. The working families tax credit and the minimum wage—my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North emphasised the effect on women workers in our community—are also important in strengthening and supporting the economy. In terms of training, infrastructure and the Government's learning and skills agenda, much can be done to support manufacturing industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan mentioned transport infrastructure and the future large aircraft, and I pay tribute to his contribution.<br><br>
I shall touch quickly on pensions. The hon. Member for Meiriommydd Nant Conwy claimed that pensioners would not support or benefit from the Government's economic measures. The Government will spend £6.5 billion on pensioners during this Parliament as a direct result of the strong economy that we have built. I asked the hon. gentleman for some general figures relating to how he would improve support for pensioners, which he refused to give. He is entitled to refuse, but perhaps he can explain why he voted against the Social Security Benefits Up-Rating Order 2000, which covered child benefit, disability and other issues as well as pensions. On 7 February, both he and his hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) voted against it. I believe that they owe the Committee an explanation.<br><br>
The economy in Wales is strong for the people of Wales. The people of Wales know that the economy is strong because they also know that the Welsh nationalists are now in league with the Conservative party in the vale of Glamorgan. They know that everything that Conservative Members and the Welsh nationalists say goes together, while the Government are moving forward with a strong economy.</span></p>
