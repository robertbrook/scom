	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This spending review is good news for all the people of our country. There has been a sustained and sustainable improvement in public finances, which allows sustained and sustainable improvement in our public services. The Government have delivered that improvement by creating stability and sustainable public finances, and establishing clear fiscal rules over the economic cycle. Our current budget is in balance, and we are borrowing only to invest within prudent and cautious limits. We have low inflation, stable growth and year-on-year current budget surpluses. The national debt is being repaid this year and next year, and extra resources are available because of—not at the expense of—our prudence. Moreover, with the help of the new deal, unemployment is now at the lowest level for 20 years. Almost 28 million people are in work in the United Kingdom—more than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we have the firm foundation of stability and a strengthened economy, we can move to the next stage in the creation of a better future. Prudent, targeted long-term investment is a social good, but in a changing and often insecure world, it is also an economic necessity. The Government have stuck to the spending envelope that was firmly established in this year's Budget. Total spending in the UK will grow by 3.25 per cent. a year in real terms. Savings on debt interest and social security have enabled the Government to free resources for priority public services. More than 75 per cent. of all increases announced in the spending review were for health, education, transport, housing, and law and order. The review's main objectives are to extend opportunity, promote responsible and secure communities, raise productivity, sustain growth, and provide a modern international role for Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spending review will not only provide cash for the Assembly but have a big impact on the quality of people's lives in Wales. In the main, the police and fire services in Wales are funded by the Home Office. By 2003–04, overall Home Office spending will be £10.6 billion—an increase of £2.4 billion on this year's plans—and in the House today, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will set out his targets and how that allocation will be spent. The annual police budget will rise by £1.6 billion. Some of that money will be used to boost the spending power of police forces in Wales, which will have a real impact on local communities. On the subject of policing, I welcome yesterday's figures, which show an overall reduction in crime rates across Wales as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
There is also a good settlement for the fire service in England and Wales, which will receive an average increase of 4.5 per cent. The criminal justice system will get more money, which will fund a programme to modernise the courts system in England and Wales. Courts will be able to improve their service and facilities, and help to ensure that cases progress more efficiently. The Department of Trade and Industry will receive a significant increase in resources to enhance Britain's world-class science base, and there will be extra funding for science and key research areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Universities' potential as engines of growth in the knowledge economy will be expanded through extra funding to commercialise research and engage with business. There will be increasing focus on building a more competitive environment, with better regulation, modern company law and effective enforcement of competition policy. All those initiatives will affect the business landscape in Wales, and—combined with the boost provided by objective 1, which I shall discuss in a moment—present a real opportunity for genuine change in the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are improving the delivery of social security services to the public, so that staff and claimants of working age can focus on finding work, not on processing claims. The service for pensioners will be overhauled, so that they can make their claims over the telephone, and the legacy of fraud and error will be tackled to release further funds to where they are really needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal will become a permanent deal. The ONE service will be extended, so that benefit recipients receive a more integrated service and claimants benefit from a personal adviser service to help them into work—which I have seen in my constituency. The new deal for over-25s will be enhanced to increase rights and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the real news is the outstanding settlement for Wales that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced yesterday. In 1999–2000, the Welsh departmental expenditure limit was just over £7 billion. By 2003–04, it will rise massively to almost £10 billion. The spending review has produced an excellent outcome for us. It represents a 5.4 per cent. above inflation average annual increase in provision—the biggest ever increase in Welsh public spending. It will give an immense boost to public services in Wales and will have a real impact on the quality of life for all the people whom we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the settlement will increase the size of the Welsh departmental expenditure limit by around £2 billion by 2003–04. Most changes in the Welsh budget have been linked to changes in United Kingdom departmental spending plans by the Barnett formula. That gives Wales a population-based share of changes in comparable spending in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extra £1.2 billion over the next three years was announced for Wales in the Budget earlier this year—£153 million for 2001–02, £394 million for 2002–03 and £653 million for 2003–04. That increase was included in the figures that were announced yesterday, but I am pleased to confirm that the amount that Wales will receive over that time has, as a consequence of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
increases in health spending in England, risen to £163 million for 2001–02, £458 million for 2002–03, and £728 million for 2003–04. Those figures are over and above the increases that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced previously. That real increase of an extra £149 million over the next three years will come to Wales because of the extra spending on health in England that was announced yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales will get £78 million in 2001–02, £183 million in 2002–03 and £290 million in 2003–04 as a result of extra spending in England on education. That excludes the funding that we will receive because of increases in education funding for local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Roads and public transport will receive significant increases as a result of the spending review, and Wales will consequently get an extra £40 million in 2001–02, £94 million in 2002–03 and £163 million in 2003–04.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significant increases in spending in England will feed into Wales through the Barnett formula, and will help to build up the massive increase in public funding available in Wales that was announced yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, the Assembly has the freedom to make its own spending decisions about the use of the extra resources in response to Welsh priorities, but the settlement will make a huge difference to the services that it provides. It will give the Assembly, in partnership with the United Kingdom Government, the resources to deliver better services and increase prosperity for all the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total increases over next year's planned baseline are £480 million in 2001–02, £1.173 billion in 2002–03 and £1.821 billion in 2003–04. Those resources will be invested in modern public services for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best of all, the settlement for Wales includes cover, outside Barnett, for the structural funds programmes in Wales. The Government have made good their commitment not to let Wales down over objective 1—£80 million pounds will be made available in 2001–02, £90 million in 2002–03 and £102 million in 2003–04. In addition to that, the European social fund money is being transferred to the Assembly from the Department for Education and Employment. That will give £38 million next year, £58 million in 2002–03 and £58 million in 2003–04.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Altogether, that means that additional funding of £113 million in 2001–02, £148 million in 2002–03 and £160 million in 2003–04 has been made available for the structural funds programmes in Wales. That means that the full forecast increase in structural funds receipts in Wales is covered. This is the first time ever that a settlement has gone beyond Barnett for structural funds. It is unprecedented. The money is completely extra, above and beyond the block grant. It is Barnett-plus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
This is a very generous settlement that recognises the special needs of Wales, with objective 1 covering around 65 per cent. of the population of Wales. Our valleys, one of which I represent in the House of Commons, west Wales and large parts of north Wales will all benefit from this funding. The settlement unlocks objective 1 funding to be used exclusively in Wales, for the first time in financial history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) and Edwina Hart, who agree that as a result of this settlement no worthwhile objective 1 project will be held back by a lack of resources. The Government have cleared the way for objective 1 to be a success in Wales. It is now time to move forward and to concentrate on the important business of ensuring that this objective 1 structural funding is a success. We need to encourage good projects, to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We can do that only by working together in partnership between the United Kingdom Government, the Assembly, and local authorities and communities in Wales. We have been given this opportunity and we must not squander it. We owe that to the people of Wales who send us to the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, this is a first-rate settlement for Wales. It is possible because the Government have managed the economy sensibly and prudently. Now we can reap the benefit of that and invest in the future of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very pleasant to be in Committee on the morning following the comprehensive spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say first, for the avoidance of doubt, that Plaid Cymru welcomes the increases in the review. I should also say that many people in Wales were expecting them in the first comprehensive spending review two or three years ago. There has been a little too much prudence in public spending in Wales. Nevertheless, we welcome the overall increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there will be great disappointment among one section of the Welsh population, to which the Secretary of State did not refer: pensioners. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members will realise when the issue comes back to haunt them at election time. Pensioners are to receive no uprating over the next three years. Will the Secretary of State comment on whether he will work in the Cabinet to restore the link to earnings? [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to a fair hearing while he is asking questions on a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State confirm that there is no additionality and no provision in the comprehensive spending review to increase pensions above the rate of inflation for the next three years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving on to the question of additionality in relation to objective 1, will the Secretary of State confirm that the actual additional sum is £272 million, and that it is not correct for him to include European social fund money in the figure, as that would already
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
have been spent by the Department for Education and Employment? There will therefore be a shortfall of about £268 million in the full European component. Although there is a welcome move towards additionality, this is not the full PES cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State comment on the main problem with the settlement, which is that every penny of match funding will have to come from the Welsh block grant? There is no additional funding for the block grant. I acknowledge that there is additionality, but nothing for the block grant. That means that the National Assembly will make its spending decisions by using its main sources of uprating in health, schools, education and transport to pay for objective 1 in Wales. Can the Secretary of State make the same claim as that made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who said that the objective European peace II programme in Northern Ireland represents exceptional public expenditure treatment and that it is fully additional?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What Cabinet discussions has the Secretary of State for Wales had about the use of receipts from the sell-off of the mobile telephone spectrum, and the decision not to use those funds to fill the match-funding gap? This morning's 	<i>Welsh Mirror</i> reports the Prime Minister saying that the proposal is a springboard for success. The problem is that the people of Wales are diving into a half-empty pool. The public expenditure round for the next three years is more than prudence with a purpose—it is prudence beyond belief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is on his own, but that is his party's fault. He knows that if other hon. Members of his party had wanted to attend this debate, the Committee could have sat yesterday. Nevertheless, we are grateful for his presence, and I shall try to answer some of his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned pensions, but they are dealt with in the Budget, not in the spending review. I remind him that his party voted against the uprating. His comments on the European social fund figures were completely wrong. Other Committee members will know that the objective 1 structural programme of £1.2 billion includes about 30 per cent. of social fund activity. That would have to have public spending cover from the Department for Education and Employment, just as it has public spending cover in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not right to say that the European social fund money that is coming into our settlement is not there—it is. The £421 million that will be used for structural funds includes the European social fund, and it will be fully covered, just as the regional development fund money is covered. Every penny from the European structural fund is extra—it is over and above the Barnett formula. That is also the case with the police programme in Northern Ireland, about which I know a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman discussed programme match funding, but he was wrong there, too. As he knows, the relevant figure is 20 per cent., although the match funding figure can vary—it can be 25 per cent. or 50 per cent., and other percentages can operate and may involve the private sector. Some of the match will come
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
from the Department for Education and Employment by way of new deal match, some will come from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by way of lottery match and much of it will come from the block. Money that has been released because of yesterday's settlement, which is already—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] We shall come to the Conservatives in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the overall figure of £10 billion by 2003, Edwina Hart and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), the First Secretary have told me that no scheme will suffer because of lack of funding. There is money in the settlement that is over and above money for health and education, and it will be used for objective 1 match funding. It is not correct to say that health and education will be affected because of what occurred. Moreover, the hon. Gentleman should recognise that the amounts that yesterday were put into the health and education services are enormous. People in my constituency, and those of my hon. Friends, are concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also comment on the record of the hon. Gentleman's party on objective 1. From beginning to end, we have heard one almighty whinge. Members of Plaid Cymru started by saying that we could not obtain objective 1 funding. Let us imagine its leadership candidates going to Berlin instead of the Prime Minister. Even if they succeeded, does the hon. Gentleman imagine that a separate Welsh budget could accommodate the extra money that has come to Wales? Welsh taxpayers could not afford those billions of pounds. When objective 1 funding had been obtained, Plaid Cymru members said that it would not cover north Wales, but it did. Then they said that we would not get the extra cash, but we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's colleague at the Assembly, Dr. Philip Williams, referred to European structural funding in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> not long ago and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>the key issue — even more important than match funding—is securing PES cover.</p></blockquote>
Everyone knew that the key decision concerned the fact that structural funds would be taken out of Barnett and added over and above it. Does he really believe that £421 million could have been found from within that block? Of course it could not. The news is excellent for Wales because every project will be funded. The Government are working for Wales, unlike the hon. Gentleman's party, which is whingeing for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As people in every part of Wales will benefit from additional funding outside the budget for the Welsh Assembly, will the Secretary of State stress, for example, the benefit to young people from genuinely new and extra money which will provide hope and opportunities under the new deal into the next Parliament? Will he also urge the National Assembly for Wales to play a full part in crime reduction, as a body designated under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is my right hon. Friend as concerned as I am about the absence of the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), who talked down Wales in the House yesterday and, having had the chance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
overnight to check the figures, has not seen fit to come to the Committee and apologise for that mistake? Will my right hon. Friend join me in inviting the members of Plaid Cymru to stop their whingeing, to join us in transforming the Welsh economy and to offer hope, opportunity and jobs for people throughout that objective 1 area, which they have failed to do during the past year with their political connivance and talking down of Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that my right hon. Friend says. The leader of Plaid Cymru, the right hon. Member for Caernarfon stated in his press release yesterday that the Chancellor concedes principle, but not the cash. I do not know about that, but there is a bit more than principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we must get on with the job of transforming the Welsh economy. The money is now available in no uncertain terms and we must ensure that the schemes are up and running and that projects are ready. Later today, I am going to see two schemes in Swansea and west Wales. It is important that the people of Wales get away from the old argument of whether the money will be forthcoming—because it has arrived—and get on with the business of transforming our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On law and order, my right hon. Friend, as a former Home Office Minister, knows that there is a genuine partnership with the National Assembly. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West and I speak regularly about those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are in a financially strong position and able to give a good settlement to Wales—and there is no question but that it is a good settlement. It is also good news for the Welsh Assembly—and those of us who have fought for it for a long time—because it has done extremely well in focusing on many of the issues, particularly the European ones, and bringing pressure to bear. I remind the Labour party that it does not have an overall majority in the Assembly, and the Assembly's representation, regardless of party, has worked together to ensure that the settlement—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Oh yes. The pressure that was brought to bear was important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also important was the fact that the Barnett formula was breached with the PES cover that was provided for European funding, which is real progress, because it brings that to Wales. However, although there is ESF funding, there is, unfortunately, no additional public sector match funding over and above the block. I should be grateful if the Secretary of State confirmed that England has been given a better public sector settlement than Wales and Wales will have to find match funding from within its own block. I believe that Wales will have to wrestle with that problem in the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
We are missing £140 million of European funding in 2000–01, outside the settlement. Is there a chance that that will be negotiated for? Will the Secretary of State admit that public sector match funding is missing, outside the Barnett formula and above it? The First Secretary admitted last night that he did not ask the Treasury for match funding, but what did the Secretary of State do? Did he ask for match funding over and above Barnett, and, if not, was that because he was told that he could not have it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to give a balanced response to the Secretary of State's statement, which contains good news but unanswered questions. It is the duty of us all to work together for the good of Wales and to enable beneficial projects to get cracking. However, some serious points remain regarding public sector match funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments on the overall settlement. We both represent Welsh constituencies and know that our constituents will benefit, through the health service or education or in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to structural funding over and above Barnett, the hon. Gentleman knows that the question of structural funding throughout the United Kingdom has been dealt with in a special way in the past few years—not a very good way, in my opinion. The view has been that it should be met within the block, because we are a net contributor to Europe. The arrangement effectively means that we recycle the money, which comes from the Exchequer, in the various parts of the United Kingdom. That has been a problem. Now, because we think that objective 1 is likely to be a one-off—with the expansion of the European Union it is quite possible that it will never come to us again—and because of the special nature of structural funding, a case can be made for dealing with it outside the block. Indeed, that has now been proved. Wales is a very special case, because of the size of the block. It was not possible to cope with the amount of money coming into Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept the Barnett formula. It has its pros and cons, but it has served us well. As a result of Barnett, our spending per head is 15 per cent. higher than that for the United Kingdom. Any further breaches of Barnett will obviously have to be taken seriously in the long term. However, it is not true that match funding has been ignored; it has been found in other ways. The hon. Gentleman should have a word with his colleague, Mr. German, in Cardiff, who said last night that he feared for Welsh schools and hospitals. What he said was rubbish. There is no possibility of schools and hospitals being affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The settlement is good and there will be sufficient money in it. However, we need not rely just on that. I have already explained that much will come from the private sector; much will come from the new deal and the lottery; and some will come from saving money within the present block, because we have unlocked it as a result of being outside Barnett. When all that is added up, there is no problem. No scheme will suffer for lack of money, because the money will be available. Schools and hospitals will not be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
The other point that was made in the Assembly, which is important, is that for some aspects of spending in Wales, whether on transport, infrastructure or economic development, it would make absolute sense to use the money within the block; to double or treble it because of objective 1 funding. There is nothing wrong with that; it makes good financial sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody knew that the key issue that we faced was to ensure that our block did not have to cope with the enormous impact of finding objective 1 funding. That has now been resolved, we are getting there and there is no problem. I am sure that Edwina Hart and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West will make these points vigorously to Assembly Members in the debate that is currently occurring. The victory has been won on objective 1 structural funding, and we must now ensure that we get ahead and proceed with the schemes and projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement and his explanation of all the additional money. It is pleasing to get our money back from Europe. Let us not forget, after all, that it comes from our taxes and that we are still net contributors to the European Union.

This morning, we have heard the claptrap and hypocrisy of the nationalists, the sanctimonious nitpicking of the Liberals—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I wanted to say something about the Tories as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening for the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his partnership discussions with the First Secretary, the Finance Chairman and all the other chairmen who seem to be rife in the Welsh Assembly, will my right hon. Friend have regard to the issues that are of most importance to the valley communities, which include some of the most deprived areas in the United Kingdom? For instance, will he consider the second hospital in Rhondda? The project has been drawn up, but it is just sitting there. The Health and Social Services Secretary of the Welsh Assembly said that it would not go ahead, although previous Governments agreed that it would do so. Will my right hon. Friend also try to accelerate money to help with the rebuilding of the Tylorstown school, which was burnt down two weeks ago? The incident has caused enormous distress in the area at the centre of the Rhondda valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend will remember that we encountered the problem of additionality 20-odd years ago, when he was the leader of Torfaen council and I was a Member of the European Parliament. We have fought the battle hard and it has taken the current Labour Government to have the courage, to do the business and to produce the money, so that the issue of additionality is out of the way at least for the time being and we can achieve the good infrastructure in Wales that is necessary for good economic development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to point out that when we discussed those matters 20-odd years ago in Brussels, we spoke about the problem of additionality and the disbenefits that it caused in Wales. I am especially happy to tell him that that problem was resolved yesterday. I shall raise the other issue to which he referred with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So many Labour Members are present that it is clear that the three-line Whip has been effective. No doubt the election campaign is about to start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago, the Secretary of State said that lots of money was sloshing around the system and that there was no problem—a remark that will go down in history alongside James Callaghan's famous comment, "Crisis? What crisis?" He should recognise that there is a serious problem in Wales. The day after the comprehensive spending review is announced, the front page of this country's best-selling newspaper has the following headline: "Tony, it's serious. They don't like us, they don't trust us, they may dump us". Does not the Secretary of State recognise that his announcement, on top of that made yesterday, will not dupe the people of Wales, as the Government have already been found out? Is it not a problem when Philip Gould, the guru to the Prime Minister,
	<br><blockquote><p>warns that the Government is seen by voters as untrustworthy?</p></blockquote>
Yesterday's announcement is part of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has told us that extra money is available, but when people realise who is paying for it—the motorists, pensioners, students, married couples and other people in Wales—they will not thank the Government. They know that they have been mugged over the past three years to pay for yesterday's announcement. He said that some of the extra money for the objective 1 match funding will come from the Department for Education and Employment, lottery funding, the private sector—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening for the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that additional funding will come from other sectors. Will he acknowledge that some of the extra money for the match funding will come from the block grant? He said that the money is in addition to the block grant and the Barnett formula and that sections of England did far better out of yesterday's announcement than Wales. It seems that money will be diverted from the health service, education and law and order to objective 1 funding. Does he realise that the people of Wales will test the Government on the delivery of the promises and not just on the promises themselves? They will look to the national health service, where waiting lists are longer than they were three years ago, to education, where more than 9,000 schoolchildren are in classes of more than 30, and to pensioners, who have had to put up with a measly 75p increase in their pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had a headline for me; I have one for him: "Just belt up" says the 	<i>Welsh Mirror</i> today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must not talk about three-line Whips. We all represent the people of Wales. Of course Labour Members are present on such an important day. We need to know about public spending for our people over the next three years. It is wrong, wrong, wrong to imply that our health and education services, after the biggest boost of spending since the creation of the health service, will not improve. That is absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not say that part of the block would not be used for match funding on top of what is available. I said that match funding would be found in a variety of ways. The key issue was to ensure that £500 million would not have to be found from the block resources over the next three years. That is what had to happen for 20 years under his Government's funding. Not one penny of structural funding money was found outside the block when his Government were in power. They were not keen on the idea. I feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman. The shadow Chancellor is worried about what he called the spending splurge, but I fancy that his colleagues in Cardiff will attack us for not spending enough. Well, there is an old-fashioned word for that—hypocrisy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is gratifying for the Welsh Affairs Committee to have all its major concerns met, including the transfer of the ESF to Wales. However, will my right hon. Friend ensure that the Government and the Assembly are encouraged to take up all objective 1 opportunities? As for the areas that are not covered by objective 1 funding, will he ask our right hon. Friend the Secretary of Sate for the Department of Trade and Industry to consider adding 10,000 people to the 100,000 who are within the regional selective assistance areas in Wales? That would allow Wrexham council, which is going to lose its assisted aid status, to maintain the industrial estate within its regional selective assistance area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is the Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. He has taken an interest in the structural funding and is obviously pleased for Wales. I shall deal with his specific points on Wrexham at another time because they are still under consideration. What is important is that areas in Wales not covered by objective 1 status will also benefit from the huge additions to the public finances announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed. The Secretary of State almost promised us at the previous Welsh Grand Committee that we would have a Treasury Minister here to answer questions. We might have got slightly different answers. The Secretary of State said in his statement that the increase in the departmental expenditure limit includes cover outside the Barnett formula for structural fund programmes in Wales. He goes on to talk about various figures, including further funding of £113 million in 2001–02, made available over and above the Barnett formula. If we study the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Chancellor's "Investing in Public Services: Wales Spending Plans" press statement from yesterday, we see that he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>There is an extra allocation of £80 million for 2001–02, £90 million for 2002–03 and £102 million for 2003–04…to ensure funding of the European share of its Objective One needs.</p></blockquote>
That is money coming from Brussels—our money going there and coming back. With regard to the European share, resources for matched funding will be provided within the total spending settlement. The Chancellor's press statement goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>The changes in the Assembly's budget in the spending review have been linked to changes in spending plans of United Kingdom Government departments by the Barnett formula.</p></blockquote>
Will the Secretary of State please tell the Committee the amount of matched funding within the Barnett formula in the Welsh block included in the settlement? The £421 million that he has talked about is money that already exists from other sources. It is the European Commission's money and the European social fund's money. It is not the additional money promised when the Prime Minister said that he would not let Wales down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been talking absolute gobbledegook and rubbish. I cannot take Conservatives seriously on public spending but I must answer the hon. Gentleman. He obviously does not know, although he should, that we are net contributors to Europe. That means inevitably that, when structural funding comes to the regions of the countries of the United Kingdom, that money must come through the United Kingdom Treasury. The recent additionality argument has been that we have been additional on a member state level. What has changed dramatically is that additionality is now at a regional level. That is hugely different and means that all the money to which I have referred—£421 million of European structural money—is extra and beyond Barnett. In the past, under the hon. Gentleman's Government, such a sum would have had to be found in the block of the Welsh Assembly or, before that, the Welsh Office. There is no question about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we cannot identify today the matched funding sum—that is a matter for the Assembly and it is dealing with it as we speak. It will not be able to identify figures in detail for quite some time until it sees, for example, the schemes and projects, the difference between private and public mix and the percentages that will have to be provided by matched funding. There are other sources; I have already referred to them. The hon. Gentleman must understand that the issue is rather complicated. I do not think that he has not got to grips with it very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Secretary of State for bringing his great news for Wales. I am sick and tired of reading and listening to the nitpicking of the Opposition. The main point made by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman whip himself to a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are so many questions to ask, but I shall ask a domestic question, which relates to money, although perhaps not to the Chancellor's statement. The Chancellor quoted many figures, but my concern is about the £3.4 million deficit in last year's grant to Bridgend county borough council. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will look into the matter. If there is money floating about, perhaps he will help to ease the problems of Bridgend county borough council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reminded by the Chair to be brief in my questioning, but the Opposition arguments about the problems that will result from the settlement have been nitpicking. The Secretary of State referred to Edwina Hart, the excellent chair of the Finance Committee of the Welsh Assembly and a good housekeeper. She said that careful auditing of the money granted to the Welsh Assembly by the Chancellor would enable the Welsh Assembly to continue with objective 1. Therefore, I am satisfied—I believe that the Secretary of State also expressed this opinion, although he also expressed concern—that what Edwina Hart said will be done. However, I hope that the Secretary of State will take up the matter that I mentioned about Bridgend county borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will certainly refer my hon. Friend's points to the First Secretary and the Finance Secretary of the Assembly because I know that those matters are of concern to many valley constituency Members. My hon. Friend's valley, perhaps above all valleys in Wales, will benefit enormously from the announcements made yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike Plaid Cymru, I am not about to whinge. That party is so mean that the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) has even finished the bottle of water in front of us without sharing it with other Opposition Members. Were I to nitpick, I would ask the Secretary of State whether he would accept that my constituents would welcome the additional money much more if more of it were directed towards Montgomeryshire. The figure is still only £11,000 per person, but that might be more of an electioneering point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question relates to agriculture. As the Secretary of State is aware, the agriculture crisis continues apace in much of rural Wales. Does he accept that if the package is as strong as he and the Government claim, it will probably serve to make the pound even stronger than it is at present, which will make it even more difficult for Welsh agriculture to export products abroad? In that context, will he outline which specific pieces of good news are most likely to help mitigate the current agriculture crisis, and can he give us an assurance that he will work with his opposite numbers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
in the Assembly to ensure that the extra money is divided in a fair and balanced way between rural and urban areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's view that it is important to be aware of the problems that face rural communities in Wales, but health and education are as important to people in rural areas as they are to people in industrial and urban areas. Of course, part of the settlement is really a matter for Europe in that it relates to subsidies, and that expenditure goes up and down according to demand. However, the budget will give the Assembly the opportunity to consider rural development plans and to help farming. It is not for me to comment on that because of the devolution settlement, but I shall work with the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary to see what can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Rather than accede to the Opposition's suggestion that a Treasury Minister should have attended the Committee today, I wonder whether my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my right hon.

As for a primary schoolteacher attending the Committee, I think that you, Mr. Jones, might be upset about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join others in congratulating my right hon. Friend. In the 21 years that I have been in politics, this is the best cash settlement that I have seen. My right hon. Friend has been quietly confident that it could be achieved. Not surprisingly, our critics, who have carped, and huffed and purled continuously during the past year, now stand before us naked—all their arguments have been stripped away. They should spend the summer months on numeracy and literacy courses so that they can read about what the Government intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those in my constituency who have supported the Labour party through thick and thin, the settlement will be very good news. Everyone is putting in bids for their own areas, and I do not want to be left out. I hope that some of that money will be spent on mental health services and on improving the NHS. After 18 years of Tory rule and despite the Government's best efforts, we still need to restore the NHS to Nye Bevan's conception. We are beginning to do that, and when another Labour Government are

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The second question is about the future of Tower colliery. Despite the best intentions of the Tory Government—it was to be closed because it was said to be unprofitable—it continues, year in, year out, to make a profit. I hope that some of that money will be invested in some of the many schemes to allow coal mining in the Cynon valley and in Wales to continue for many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The prospect of Opposition Members being naked is unnerving. Only last week, the First Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Secretary for Trade and Industry and I discussed the question of Tower colliery. I shall be in touch with my hon. Friend about that. I take to heart what she said about mental health, and I hope that the Assembly will be able to address the problem with the extra money that will now be coming its way. My hon. Friend represents one of the most deprived communities in Wales, and it says a great deal that she welcomes the settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome yesterday's statement by the Chancellor and today's statement by my right hon. Friend. There was certainly a welcome in the hillside for it. The only noises to be heard were from the green linnets—the Welsh nationalist party. Does my right hon. Friend share my dismay that the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) has not made time in his diary to discuss this important announcement today? Certain people will end up with egg on their faces, and the right hon. Gentleman will be one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of life for my constituents will be greatly improved by the proposals, which will provide an enormous boost. Was not the Secretary of State surprised at the glum faces of the Tories yesterday, here in Westminster and in Wales? Was he surprised when the Opposition parties in Wales—the Welsh nationalists, the Liberal Democrats and the Tories—seemed to jump into bed together to criticise the wonderful statement made in the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, does the Secretary of State share my concern that one reason why the hon. Member for Ceredigion sits in Committee today is because the right hon. Member for Caernarfon, when leading his party, misled the people of Wales about objective 1? Yesterday we were given the delivery dates and we look forward to more announcements shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The absence or otherwise of Opposition Members was, in a sense, in their hands. A case was made for this Committee to sit yesterday, but that did not happen because we could

not agree. That would have given right hon. and hon. Members the opportunity to be here and in Cardiff. However, that opportunity has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a telling point about her own constituency. Conwy was added to the list of objective 1 areas as a result of the Government's pleading, and against the hopes of the Opposition parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on securing such an excellent settlement for Wales. Does he agree that now is the time for the Opposition parties to stop carping and whingeing, and to throw their weight behind this excellent settlement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State also agree that, with regard to objective 1 funding, it is now up to the Assembly to deliver the projects for Wales and to narrow the gap in prosperity between Wales and the rest of Britain? That is now our task. My constituency of Cardiff, North is not in the objective 1 funding area, but we all know that to have a prosperous, united Wales, the provisions must cover everyone. We welcome the fact that objective 1 funding has been secured for the whole of Wales, and we know that in Cardiff, North we will benefit from the extra money for public services. I should also like to echo the plea for extra help for mental health services, because in Cardiff, North we have Whitchurch hospital and the centre for the Cardiff Community Vale mental health trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say for the record that, in my previous answer, when I used the word "hopes", I meant "expectations". That is rather different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) takes a particular interest in the problems of the mentally ill. That issue has also been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), and it is important to all of us who represent Welsh constituencies. I will certainly press the matter home. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North has the unique opportunity to make the point elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned the carping, whingeing and moaning from Plaid Cymru about objective 1 over the past 18 months. That has gone on to such an extent that the front runner for the Plaid Cymru leadership is known as Ieuan Whinge Jones throughout the length and breadth of Wales. Members of Plaid Cymru have been Jeremiahs and prophets of doom, deliberately talking Wales down for their own political ends at the expense of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my right hon. Friend agree that the practical effect of Plaid Cymru's negative campaign, and its antics over objective 1, is that the voluntary sector in Wales has lost its enthusiasm to develop objective 1 projects? Plaid Cymru has confused the public sector in Wales, which is developing the structures for delivering objective 1. Perhaps the most damaging effect of its antics has been to frighten off the private sector investment necessary for successful objective 1 projects. Will my right hon. Friend explain what practical steps can be taken to re-enthuse and

reinvigorate the private, public and voluntary sectors in Wales to ensure the delivery of the projects for which Wales is crying out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to tell my hon. Friend that after the Committee I am going to Wales to meet the First Secretary to consider a number of projects that could attract structural funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In north, south and mid Wales we must place the emphasis on improving our economy, and in the areas that are fortunate enough to attract objective 1 funding we must ensure that we are able to get down to work on delivering those schemes. The last thing that we want is to have to give any money back to Europe, as has happened in other parts of the United Kingdom and Europe. The longer that we squabble about the money, the worse that it will be in terms of getting down to the hard work of ensuring that the schemes go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree with the Chancellor, who said this morning that now that the amount of money has been settled—in Wales that amount will be very considerable—the debate must move on to how it is to be spent? Will he urge the minority parties in the Welsh Assembly to accept that, in order to deliver good value in public services in Wales—especially given the opportunities that are represented by the new money—we need to modernise and make efficient those services? That sometimes means confronting vested interests and narrow parochial concerns. The minority parties in Wales have not been prepared to do that over the past year, and have thereby betrayed an opportunity and betrayed Wales. Will my right hon. Friend encourage them to adopt a more responsible attitude to public services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be more than happy to do so. I agree with my hon. Friend, whose experiences as a Minister in the Wales Office will have led him to believe that what matters is not simply money, but how it is spent, and to ensure the best delivery of services, that expenditure must coincide with reform and modernisation. Now that the money is there, our colleagues in Cardiff are responsible for ensuring that it is spent wisely and fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly congratulate my right hon. Friend on his part in this groundbreaking settlement. Does he agree that its generosity throws into sharp focus the urgent need to ensure that the modest sums of money that are required to safeguard jobs in Broughton are made available? The campaign to safeguard those jobs is closely identified with the Chairman of this Committee, who has led it with gusto, enthusiasm and skill, and it is fully supported by all Labour Members in north Wales, because we recognise the major strategic importance of Broughton to the economy of the whole area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I have said to him, and to you, Mr. Jones, on the Floor of the House, the United Kingdom Government put more than £500 million of launch aid money into the project to ensure that jobs are retained at Broughton. It is the biggest single industrial plant in Wales, and also employs people from outside Wales, from the border areas of England. I know how important Broughton is to my hon. Friend's constituency, and he can rest assured that I continue to discuss it with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and with the First Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my right hon. Friend on the excellent announcements that he has made this morning. Does he agree that there are now clear dividing lines between the political parties in Wales? The Labour Government want to expand public expenditure by 5.4 per cent. per year for the first three years of the next Parliament. The Conservatives have set their face against public spending and want £16 billion of cuts, up to £1 billion of which would come from Wales. The nationalist party is increasingly outing itself as the party of independence and separatism, which would lose the Barnett formula and thereby lose, at a stroke, 15 per cent. of public spending in Wales. There would be no match funding, and we would face a headlong rush to bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can sum it up by saying that the Conservative party would not, and the Welsh National party could not, give us the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my constituents, I thank my right hon. Friend for the role that he has played in Cabinet in securing this settlement for Wales. Does he agree that, provided that the new investment is spent on the right strategic projects, the whole of Wales will benefit, and not just objective 1 areas? Constituencies such as mine with strategic ports, airports and industries will also benefit, but is he aware that non-objective 1 areas may apply for urban initiative money? Will he ask his colleagues in the Welsh Assembly to consider carefully the strong bid that is being put together in respect of the Vale of Glamorgan?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to my right hon. Friend's statement with interest, and I thought that he referred to a year-on-year increase of 5.4 per cent. in real terms over three years. Are we therefore talking about an actual increase of more than 7.4 per cent., and if so, is not that the biggest increase ever? Three quarters of the nationalists, including their parliamentary leader, have not even bothered to turn up today. Is not that a clear indication of how good this settlement is for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, and his initial point is particularly important. Although objective 1 areas will draw from that fund, there will nevertheless be an impact on surrounding areas, particularly in constituencies such as the Vale of Glamorgan, which he and Jane Hutt represent well in this place and the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend agree that, in taxation terms, the Welsh economy by itself could not produce anything like that increase over the next three years? That money is coming to Wales because Wales is part of Britain. Sadly, the gap between current public expenditure and taxation is probably getting even wider. In those circumstances, is it not incumbent on the party of the hon. Member for Ceredigion, which wants to leave Britain and join Europe, to explain where it would find the money? Would it come from Europe, or would there be massive cuts in public expenditure and massive increases in taxation? If so, the Welsh economy would be sent spiralling into a black hole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, who has made those points well in earlier debates. When we return after the recess, I hope that this Committee will have the chance to debate in further detail not only the settlement but the matter to which he referred. As a former Treasury Minister, he makes the point much more eloquently than I could have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My train of thought has been derailed by the gruesome image of naked Opposition Members with egg on their faces, jumping into bed together for a group gripe. I shall try to cast that from my mind and congratulate my right hon. Friend and others who are responsible for this splendid settlement, which will help people in every part of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few minor questions. I do not want to carp about the objective 1 categories, but they are rather crude. Certainly, the most deprived areas in Wales are in the valleys, and we rejoice in the fact that help will be concentrated there, but I should point out some imperfections in the system. As I discussed at some length in our previous sitting, the ward with the worst levels of deprivation in Wales is outside objective 1 status, although, although other wards of relative prosperity are inside it. I also stress the fragility of the steel industry in Wales—although there is prosperity in the steel areas, we cannot build on it with great confidence, despite the fact that the industry contributes 6 per cent. to Wales's gross domestic product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the splendid early-day motion 985, which was tabled this morning by two honourable pensioners. It gently reminds the Government that while there is much gratitude for their approach, it is possible to restore the link between pensions and earnings, which is a source of great concern among our constituents. That can be done for the next five years without any additional spending and until 2011 without increasing national insurance contributions above the rate of inflation. I hope that my right hon. Friend will give an assurance that that is uppermost in the minds of Cabinet members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never think of my hon. Friend as a pensioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the point that my hon. Friend made about pockets of deprivation in areas that are not objective 1. His constituency is next to mine, and I know that parts of Newport are as deprived as parts of my own valley. I hope that the Assembly will find a way to deal with the discrepancy. On the steel industry, my hon. Friend and I share an interest in what happens to, for example, Llanwern. Many of my, and my hon. Friend's, constituents work there—indeed, my hon. Friend did so, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While it is right to demand extra moneys for pensioners—some of us always vote for that—can my right hon. Friend explain how the nationalists can demand additional money for pensioners when, a few months ago, they voted against pension increases and every other welfare benefit increase, which were designed to tackle deprivation in communities such as mine? This is a superb settlement—I speak as someone who represents one of the poorest communities in Wales—but a problem might arise in the Assembly. Additional money in the local government settlement, including £5 million for my constituency, was set aside to tackle deprivation, but the nationalists, Tories and Liberals were not willing to vote for the money. The neighbouring borough of Caerphilly shares a project with Blaenau Gwent, at Bryn Bach park, which is one of the most beautiful parts of Wales. It supports people with special needs, but the nationalist-run council in Caerphilly withdrew the money and placed at risk the park's existence and the employment of those people with special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, occasionally find the actions of our political opponents inexplicable. I remind my hon. Friend, who represents a heads of the valleys constituency, that the whole purpose of objective 1 was to ensure that areas such as his and mine get special treatment as a result of that status. He referred to the local government settlement, which is, of course, for the Assembly to deal with. I understand his point, and I give him the assurance that I shall raise it with the First Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government's commitment to modernising the national health service is already evident in my constituency? There is a new hospital in Chepstow, a new day hospital in Abergavenny, and a new health and social care facility is due to be built in Monmouth. Does he agree that one part of the national health service needs careful examination, namely, the ambulance service? Its deficiencies were recently demonstrated in my constituency, when a young baby who had been bitten by a dog, did not receive the services of an ambulance which was based at Newport, which is more than 20 miles away. My constituents

	<div class='title'>Economic Regeneration (Swansea Valley)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. Touhig.</i>]</p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel lucky and privileged to have secured the first Adjournment debate at a Welsh Grand Committee. However, I am sorry to say that the focus of the debate is a community that has been neither lucky nor privileged in recent years. The subject of the debate is economic regeneration in the Swansea valley, but the subject that I applied to speak to was regenerating Clydach. I intend to speak widely and to cover regeneration other than just economic regeneration, but my main focus will be the village of Clydach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For more than a year now, whenever I have spoken about Clydach to people from outside the Swansea area, they have immediately responded with the comment, "You mean the murder village." That is not surprising and I do not blame people for being reminded of the major news story of the tragedy that put Clydach in the limelight. Whenever I see the name Dunblane or Hungerford, the tragedies there come to mind. Every right-minded person must be sickened at the monstrous crime that ended the lives of a grandmother, a mother and two small children. We are all dismayed that the crime remains unsolved more than a year after it happened. The recent arrests and releases have, inevitably, renewed media interest and, just as inevitably, increased the anxiety, fear and anger felt by many people in Clydach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first purpose this morning is to say that it does no good to allow that terrible tragedy to define the community of Clydach. It does a particular disservice to the victims of those horrendous murders who were part of the village and knew it as the decent, caring and responsible community that it really is and it is not helpful to the surviving family and friends who remain part of the community or who live in nearby villages and still look to Clydach as their local centre. Clydach is not a murder village. It is a fine community where an appalling crime was committed for which justice remains to be done. It is even more than that. It is part of my constituency that has taken some hard knocks in recent years and where some real problems have developed, to which I shall refer. It is also a community that has recently decided not to wait for someone to do something about those knocks, but to solve its problems. It has decided to set its own agenda for the future, and that is what I want to talk about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clydach lies about six miles north of Swansea city centre and has a population of about 7,500. In many ways, I suspect that its history since the early 1970s is fairly typical of similar villages and small towns in the valleys of south Wales. Until the mid-1970s, it was a thriving employment and retail centre, but as the heavy, labour-intensive industries were run down—a process that accelerated markedly after 1979—Clydach, as an economic centre and, in some ways, as a cohesive community, began to decline. Even for those who found alternative employment, the link between work and community was broken. For instance, Inco, traditionally the main employer in Clydach, whose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
works still dominate the village, employed more than 1,500 people in the early 1970s. Now about 300 people are on the payroll. It is still a vital force in the local economy but it is no longer central to the lives of every family in Clydach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retail core of Clydach, the high street, has contracted, and in the main provides just a local service centre. The word "just" is not meant dismissively. The role fulfilled is important, especially because Clydach has a high proportion of elderly residents and other people with mobility or transport problems. Sadly, the local retail centre is still under threat. Businesses in the high street struggle to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts of the village have become popular residential locations because of Clydach's closeness to the M4, Swansea and other employment opportunities. As a result, Clydach-wide statistics on economic and social factors disguise some significant and serious problems below the surface. In particular, Graigfelen ward scores very badly with respect to economic activity, income levels, sickness, mortality, proportion of single-parent households and population loss in the 20 to 59 age group. The level of car ownership per household is very low. It is one of the three most deprived wards in the City and County of Swansea. Some of its problems are mirrored elsewhere in Clydach—most notably in the Penydre area towards the other end of the village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of years back, the local hospital was mothballed. A few months ago, Lloyds TSB pulled out. A couple of weeks ago, it was announced that a family cafe that had been going for 70 years was closing down. What I am talking about in Clydach is not massive decline or the lack of any prospect of future growth; it is not the breakdown of community values or social responsibility. Rather, I am talking about the slow run-down of the village, accompanied by a debilitating loss of hope or expectation; a depressing feeling that continued decline is inevitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the three years that I have been a Member of Parliament, the monthly surgeries that I have held in Clydach have worried me more than any that I have held in any part of Gower, not because of the nature of the problems, but because so often they have been accompanied by an expectation that they cannot not be solved. That is partly because of a feeling that Clydach had been more or less written off by Government at all levels. I do not think that that is true or fair, but I understand how cynicism has grown over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitude was reinforced in the mid-1990s when the then responsible local authorities, West Glamorgan county council and Lliw Valley borough council, commissioned consultants Chapman Warren to draw up a regeneration strategy for Clydach. That was done, and a final report was produced, in October 1995, which was adopted in principle by the two councils. It followed a model set in other Lliw valley communities, where physical regeneration strategies were carried through, particularly in Pontardawe and Pontarddulais.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
With local government reorganisation, the new City and County of Swansea undertook what was described as a public-participation exercise, including a three-day exhibition in Clydach library, articles in the local press and special meetings with the community council and Clydach chamber of trade. Members of the community read and heard fine descriptions of what might happen. They saw wonderful artists' impressions of what could happen to their village as the regeneration strategy was carried out. Unfortunately, nothing came of the exercise, apart from some improvements to a car park outside the community centre. Disappointment and disillusionment were further reinforced. To be fair, the City and County of Swansea used the Chapman Warren report as the basis of bids for challenge funding and strategic development scheme funding, but was unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Chapman Warren approach identified correctly some of the needs, especially for the physical regeneration and improvement of the environment in Clydach, it was a top-down process with a bit of consultation tacked on. It got the general key aims right: to arrest the further decline of the town's retail core; to create a retail environment that is attractive, safe and convenient; to create opportunities for new business set-ups; to create recreational links in the study area and the strategic or evolving regional network; to remove derelict property; to improve environmental quality; to improve community support facilities at Graigfelen; and to foster partnerships between public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the detailed proposals did not reflect the community's priorities. At the end of last year, Clydach tried to do things the other way round—although, at first, not completely the other way round. A bunch of politicians—those on the community council, the county council, Members of the National Assembly and myself as Member of Parliament—who represent Clydach at all levels, from different political parties and no party, were called together by the village dentist, who is also a community councillor, to set the ball rolling just before Christmas. That meeting began a series of meetings with other individuals and organisations that might have a part to play in creating a better and more secure future for Clydach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agreed that we did not want to resurrect the Chapman Warren strategy or follow a similar proposal which would result in another set of bids to make the place look a bit better. We wanted to step back and say, "Do we really know what the people of Clydach want? How do they see their community developing? What are their priorities? What are their needs?" We tried to find answers to those questions while stimulating interest in local people and getting them directly involved in making that regeneration happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We went to see the management of Inco—or the Mond as it is still known in the area. It was understandably cautious but, after deliberation, made a commitment to financial support to the tune of several thousand pounds and to consider providing other resources in the future. We went to see the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
chamber of trade. Some of its members were, understandably, bitter. The improvements to the high street that they expected years ago had never happened and they did not want to invest more time and effort in another doomed or futile project. However, they were persuaded to come on board and send a representative to our meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We organised a meeting of voluntary sector organisations, including sports clubs, Churches, disabled groups, the civic society, school parent-teacher associations and anyone else who came to mind. We consulted young people from the secondary schools that serve Clydach. Although some people identified them as part of the problem, we knew that they were a key part of the solution. They told us what was wrong from their perspective and what would make their lives fuller and more enjoyable as youngsters and their futures in Clydach more interesting, exciting and rewarding. What emerged from the interchanges was the realisation that Clydach was still a community. Its members cared about its future and, if they believed that change could happen, they were prepared to help to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as we were fostering that involvement, we were investigating what structure we needed to advance the objectives that we were starting to identify. We decided on the community development trust model for several reasons. First, CDTs have a proven track record in Wales and other parts of the United Kingdom. Secondly, in our discussions, we had come to realise that, to achieve and sustain regeneration in Clydach, we needed to adopt a comprehensive way forward that brought together economic regeneration, social development and environmental improvement. We discovered that dealing with those components separately was less effective than a more joined-up and holistic approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we chose a CDT because we wanted to move quickly to identify projects and put in bids to funders to make them happen. Development trusts are familiar to such bodies, straightforward to deal with and transparent in structure. Fourthly, development trusts are about doing things—delivering results—rather than talking in endless committees about the possibility of making things happen. They are also flexible beasts and, frankly, we wanted to create something that would fit in with the objective 1 set-up that is being established by the Welsh Assembly. In particular, we wanted to adopt the partnership model advocated by the Assembly and the European Union—the tripartite approach involving political representatives, the business community and the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have adopted precisely that model for the board of the trust. We hope that Clydach will be well placed in that way to participate in and to benefit from the west Wales and valleys programme in the next few years. It is exactly the sort of community that needs objective 1 support and, we suggest, the new community trust is just the sort of vehicle to act as a local partnership to achieve the economic, social and environmental objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Clydach community trust is a three-way partnership. However, to regenerate Clydach as we want to, we will need help from other organisations and agencies working at various levels. The partnership approach must be stretched beyond the boundaries of Clydach. Members of the board and others involved with the development trust have moved quickly to establish links with players that might be able to help. We have had meetings with the Welsh Development Agency, West Wales training and enterprise council, Iechyd Morgannwg health authority and various local authority departments in the City and County of Swansea, as well as regular meetings with its leader and chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also opened discussions with Lloyds TSB bank, from which we are trying to get some conscience money or resource. It has moved out of the high street in Clydach and we are asking it to give us the premises as a base from which the community development trust can work. We have not yet had a response from Lloyds TSB bank, but we are keeping the pressure on. The other agencies with which we have opened negotiations have been positive and keen to play a partnership role as we move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point brings me to the most important thing about the community development trust: its practical plans for improving the village and the quality of life of the people who live there. Frankly, I thought that that task was going to be the difficult one. The more organisations and individuals became involved, the more varied the sets of ideas on the way forward would emerge. I foresaw a difficult stage at which we would have to prioritise, and that might have put noses out of joint, thereby losing the enthusiasm or even the support of parts of the community. In fact, so far, that has not really happened, although it might do when we are a little further down the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Remarkably, there is an amazing consensus in Clydach about the things that should be tackled first. Virtually everyone wants the high street—the little retail centre of Clydach—to be improved, believing that that would be the best early symbol of the regeneration of the village as a whole. Everyone wants to see something done about the disused swimming pool and park area beside the canal at Forge Fach in the village. Everyone wants the old Globe cinema—a large and unsightly asbestos-clad shed—pulled down, with something useful put in its place. Everyone recognises that there is very little for teenagers to do in Clydach. Everyone would like a range of training opportunities to be available in the village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tonight, the Clydach community trust board is meeting. I am pretty sure that it will establish three sub-groups to work with the wider community to develop three detailed projects. One will be the improvement of the physical environment of the high street. That will need investment by the council and the traders. Hopefully, a commercial improvement area will be created to help retailers to improve the appearance of their shops at more or less the same time as pavement improvements, tree planting and other street-enhancement work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Another group will tackle the redundant swimming pool site. It will draw up proposals for a community leisure centre, which could be a tremendous resource for all age groups in Clydach. We believe that the community council will be prepared to contribute the land and the cost of demolition of the old swimming pool, but we will be looking to outside funders to help with investment in the new centre. A meeting with Sportslot has been arranged. A third group will work on the old Globe cinema site. Its redevelopment will include a resource centre for the community, where training schemes and other facilities can be housed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The projects are all ambitious but they are demonstrably what Clydach wants and needs. I firmly believe that the community of Clydach can make them happen and that they will be just the start. Far from being defined as the murder village, it might already be offering a model for regeneration to small communities throughout Wales. The model requires local politicians of different political parties to submerge their differences whenever possible and to seek common objectives. Most challengingly for us as politicians, it requires us not to claim more than our fair share of responsibility for the achievements of or in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The model requires the community's ownership of community development. Other partners are welcome, but the community must be in the driving seat. The basic impetus must be bottom up. The model is built on partnership at every level and between levels and on inclusion and involvement. I know that these are early days, that it could still all go pear-shaped and that nothing might come from a lot of hard work, but I do not think that that will happen. I honestly believe that Clydach is turning round. The community development trust is one sign of that and I hope that it will be the vehicle for all sorts of initiatives in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other things are also happening. Today—it is all happening today as far as Clydach is concerned—the area health authority is meeting to discuss options for reopening Clydach hospital. Its preferred option is a multi-use facility, including a base for the community mental health team and voluntary organisations, such as Crossroads, that service the area. The project also includes an out-patients facility and health-centre services, and will be welcomed by the community. The problem is, however, that about £1 million of capital investment is needed to bring the building up to scratch. Of course, the decision will be for the National Assembly, but the project has much better prospects after the Chancellor's announcement yesterday and the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Graigfelen, the poorest part of the village, is now the base for a sure start programme as part of the battle against child poverty. Of course, the national minimum wage, the working families tax credit and other Government measures are helping that worst-off part of Clydach, as well as other deprived communities in the area. The beautiful Royal Society for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
Protection of Birds reserve at Cwm Clydach has just received major investment to create accessible pathways for elderly and disabled people, and other organisations have proposed improvements to the Clydach environment. Let us have no more Clydach, the murder village—rather, Clydach, the village of imagination, determination and achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I conclude my eulogy to Clydach, I am conscious that I have not pressed my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for any specific action or actions. I invite him to visit Clydach, to meet the trust board and others involved in making the village an even finer community and to see for himself why I want Clydach to be recognised for what it really is and for what it can achieve. My only other message is to urge Government at all levels to embrace local initiatives such as the one in Clydach, which I hope my hon. Friend will come to see, to provide the support and partnership that they need and to ensure that the direction is always set by the community itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) on securing what I believe to be the first Adjournment debate in a Welsh Grand Committee. He has shown that whatever else he may be, he is certainly an effective champion for Clydach and its community. I know that his points are heartfelt and that they come from his roots in the community. They also reflect his genuine and passionate concern for social justice in Clydach, as well as his desire to support the regeneration projects that he has mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragic events that have occurred in Clydach in the past year have brought the area to the attention of many people in Wales. However, I have learned from my hon. Friend that, despite those events, what defines Clydach is its spirit of community and partnership and its willingness to take on the challenges and to improve the community for the benefit of all its people. My hon. Friend has shown that he shares those objectives by initiating the debate. He pointed out that the Government have a role in helping to develop and foster partnership, while ourselves working in partnership with the National Assembly for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happily take up my hon. Friend's invitation to visit Clydach. I shall be pleased to arrange through my office a visit to see the area, to meet the people who are involved in community regeneration, and to look at what they are doing and, I hope, work with them in developing the community. I hope also to help in bringing together the Government, the National Assembly, local councils and community partners, to ensure that Clydach and its surrounding area is a better place—my hon. Friend's key objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned economic regeneration, which is an important theme. It is the Government's policy to ensure that opportunity and security are central to our objectives. That goes hand in hand with the need for regeneration of the country's poorest communities. The slow decline to which my hon. Friend referred is typical of that in many communities,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
which the Government are determined to redress. A number of economic regeneration programmes are currently operating in Wales and are the responsibility of the National Assembly: the new local regeneration fund; the new development scheme; and, in particular, the strategic development scheme, which has provided more than £9 million in three years to the city and county of Swansea for the Swansea vale strategy that was approved in 1995–96.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the Clydach community trust as a model of three-way partnership. I welcome that. He will also be aware of the Amman and Swansea valley regeneration partnership, led by Powys county council, which was set up in the wake of the Lucas closure, and which aims to develop an action plan to assist in finding a new future for the Amman and Swansea valleys. That links to issues related to objective 1, which we have discussed at length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partnership between the Government and the Assembly is important. The Government have been responsible for getting the economic fundamentals right, for securing objective 1 status in the first place and for delivering funding through a range of schemes, such as the Employment Service's new deal. It is no secret that because of failure during the Conservative years, areas such as Clydach and the Swansea valley are suffering from a lower gross domestic product per capita than the rest of the United Kingdom. That is one reason why they have been included in the west Wales and valleys objective 1 area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attaining objective 1 status is not something to be proud of because it is a result of the slow decline over many years that my hon. Friend mentioned. I believe that objective 1 will provide a step change to the economy of areas such as Clydach, Swansea and Wales as a whole. That is not to say that the City and County of Swansea, of which Clydach forms a part, does not have a lot to offer people in our community. Its location on the M4 and its other transport connections create opportunities. Major investments have been made, such as that by International Rectifiers, the new call centre at the enterprise park and the new development of Swansea marina. The area also has great tourism potential and could bring inward investment into the Swansea area via the tourist pound. However, I recognise that there are particular needs and deprivation in that wider picture of success. I hope that the spending review announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will be key in helping to support the efforts of the voluntary sector, the residents of Clydach and their elected representatives to ensure that we can develop a strong partnership for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the creation of stability in public finances, we have been able to allow the National Assembly greater investment in health, education, opportunity, housing and transport. It will determine its priorities in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
due course, but those resources are now available to communities such as Clydach and to support the projects outlined by my hon. Friend. Only by investing in health, transport and the environment can we make a step change in our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the National Assembly voted in November to draw up an action strategy specifically to address the issues of economic and community development, environmental improvement and ill health, and to ensure that we have high quality and accessible public transport. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's spending review will ensure that, by 2004, new resources will be available to improve communities such as Clydach. The minimum wage, working families tax credit and improvements in child benefit are all designed to make that step change; to lift communities out of poverty and support regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Government have secured objective 1 status will mean that west Wales and the valleys, including Clydach, will be included in the biggest new United Kingdom objective 1 programme. The Government's achievement will provide a real opportunity to boost the economy of Wales and deliver long-term gains to all the people in Wales. The spending review provides for extra money for structural funds above the Barnett formula, which will mean that no worthwhile objective 1 projects will be held back because of a lack of resources. I hope that that will help to develop such projects to be submitted for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be opportunities to expand the small and medium enterprise base and the knowledge-based economy to allow economic regeneration, and to promote employability, social inclusion and the development of the learning society. There will also be a strategic infrastructure. In Wales, and particularly in the City and County of Swansea, 4,360 people under the age of 25 have benefited under the new deal, and another 1,770 long-term unemployed people have joined the new deal. Those are real and important opportunities. Last week, in conjunction with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, I was able to announce the action team for jobs that will be of great benefit to the Swansea valley and other parts of west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clydach is a community with great strengths, and my hon. Friend is a great champion of it. It has been a pleasure to listen to him speak about the projects, and the Government-supported self-help schemes. I commend his statements to the Committee, and I look forward to visiting Clydach, learning more about it and helping to ensure that the Government tackle the issues positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
