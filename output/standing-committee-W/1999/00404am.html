	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked</i>—</p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Cardiff Airport</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he next plans to meet the owners of Cardiff international airport to discuss opportunities for increasing business travel. [116180]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no immediate plans to meet the owners of Cardiff international airport. However, I recognise the importance of the airport to the continued economic well-being of south Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply. He may discover that, according to Civil Aviation Authority figures, as much as 75 per cent. of business air travel has been lost by Cardiff international airport to other airports because of poor service access. It is also a widespread belief in the business community in Wales that access to business air travel is an essential prerequisite for the regeneration of the Welsh economy with or without objective 1 funding. In view of the decision not to proceed with the proposals for an airport link road, will he meet the First Secretary and impress on him the importance of finding a viable alternative route as a matter of urgency for the Welsh economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the First Secretary regularly and I shall, of course, ensure that those points are relayed to him. As my hon. Friend knows, Vale of Glamorgan council has had a study undertaken of road links for the airport and I am aware of the airport's importance to the economic life not only of south Wales, but of the whole of Wales. I hope that it will play a vital role in our new regenerated economy that I hope will develop in the years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Block Grant</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received about increasing the block grant in relation to local government funding. [116181]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have met local authorities on several occasions and discussed a range of issues with them, including funding issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that response, but the Minister will know that the increase in council tax this year throughout Wales averages more than 10 per cent., which is five times the rate of inflation, at a time when many people are receiving inflation rate salary
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
increases or no increase at all—and decreases if they happen to be farmers. Will he explain why the increases have been so high, especially in Wales? It is not as though people are receiving the increases that Russell Goodway, the Labour leader of Cardiff council, has received recently. I now give the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to condemn such increases and to demand that Russell Goodway decreases his salary forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's constructive comments. He approaches the matter with an element of restraint. As we discussed at Welsh Questions and in the Welsh Grand Committee, the Assembly and the Welsh Local Goverment Association are currently looking at a fairer formula for local government spending for the settlement for next year's grant. As he knows, decisions on budgets and council tax are up to individual authorities and they vary throughout Wales. Some authorities are considering different levels of increase because of the demands in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Mr. Goodway, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Assembly Secretary, Mr. Peter Law, is discussing that matter with Cardiff council and the Welsh Local Government Association. It is important that we give them the opportunity to reflect on the issue because of the possibility of a successful outcome that will benefit local government throughout Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is aware that my constituency has not only one of the poorest communities in Wales, but according to recent statistics, one of the poorest communities in the United Kingdom and that the forumula that deals with the distribution of the block grant does not take poverty into consideration. Will he meet his opposite number in the Assembly to discuss such matters to ensure that the main factor that determines the new formula is poverty? Will he comment on the fact that one of the Assembly Members—Phil Williams—who represents my area refused to support the recent deal to bring an additional £5 million into Blaenau Gwent through the block grant distribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I mentioned, the Assembly and the WLGA are considering a new formula, and it is important to include elements such as poverty in it. However, those remain matters for the National Assembly. I will certainly take an interest. I am meeting Peter Law, the Assembly Secretary, next Monday to discuss local government issues. As my hon. Friend will be aware, I was in Blaenau Gwent yesterday evening with members of his local authority, and we discussed a range of local authority issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) that local government funding is important. In that context, it is important to recognise that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has put tremendous additional resources at the disposal of the National Assembly, including money for education, which will go directly to schools and will support local government expenditure in the next financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I agree that the hon. Member for Blaenau
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Gwent (Mr. Llew Smith) is right to say that his area is poverty-stricken, it is not true that four councils in the valleys are very poor and need special, targeted additional funding? It is not fair that other authorities in Wales are having to fund the programme; that should be the Government's duty. Sparsely populated rural areas have experienced a hike in business rates, which have gone up two and a half times, and a 13 per cent. increase in council tax. Those areas are poor, too, and need due consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only reiterate that the formula is up for discussion. The Welsh Local Government Association, the National Assembly and the Government take an interest in such matters and will examine the issue. I can add nothing to what the hon. Gentleman has said, except to say that business rates in Wales have risen on average by 6 per cent. this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Railways</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with train operating companies in Wales on the establishment of a single franchise covering all Welsh railways. [116183]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None. Rail franchises are a matter for the shadow Strategic Rail Authority and, in due course, the Strategic Rail Authority, in consultation with the National Assembly for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reply from the Secretary of State. In that context, could we have a beefed up Welsh presence on the Strategic Rail Authority? Is he aware of a report by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs that said that two board members should represent Wales on the authority? Will he bat for that proposal in the Cabinet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the Transport Bill, which is currently going through the House and will soon go to the other place, deals with such matters. There will be a Welsh representative on the board of the SRA, and the Assembly will be consulted on the appointment. Additionally, the SRA will be required by legislation to consult the Assembly on its strategies. The shadow SRA has already met the Assembly's Local Government and Environment Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Pensioners</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received from pensioners in Wales concerning the measures announced in the Budget. [116184]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I are aware of pensioners' concerns, but we have received no representations on measures announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in his recent Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the rise in the heating allowance from £100 to £150, which was announced in the Budget, and the minimum income guarantee, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
will help our poorest pensioners. Does my hon. Friend agree that the richest quarter of pensioners have done well in the past 20 years from private pensions, but that we must do more to help the bottom half and that that should be the main focus of the new pensioners' credit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right in the sense that there is a great discrepancy between pensioners who have done well in the past 20 years and those who have fallen behind as a result of changes made by the previous Government. This Government are attempting to support a guaranteed weekly minimum income, which will rise as a result of the Chancellor's Budget to £75 for single pensioners and £116.50 for couples. It will rise in line with earnings from this month. I hope that that will help the poorest pensioners in our community. Together with the extra measures that the Government have introduced in regard to heating allowances, free eye tests and television licences for those over 75, the minimum income guarantee forms a package that will, I hope, help the poorest pensioners. It will give direct support to pensioners across the board, but will target those on lower incomes in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with my hon. Friend that pensioners have received many benefits in the budget for which they are grateful, would he agree that it is now necessary to look at the basic level of pensions to see whether it can be increased? If there are some pensioners who have done very well over the last 20 years, the way to deal with that is through a progressive system of income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend will be aware, I have no direct responsibility for raising the basic level of pensions. The Government entered the general election with a manifesto commitment to retain the basic pension as the foundation for income in retirement and to increase it at least in line with prices. That is what the Government have done to date, and what the Government are committed to do. I heard what he said with regard to the basic level of pensions. I believe the Government have attempted to raise pensioner incomes and have succeeded in doing so, not in a way linked to taxation but through things such as the winter fuel payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the extra £110 million allocated to the national health service in Wales, can I ask my hon. Friend whether there are any suggestions as to what can be done with the old, tired NHS Tory Trojan horse of privatisation? Should it be sent out to grass or to the knacker's yard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a question about pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the impact of the Government's additional expenditure on the national health service on pensioners in particular in Wales, I believe that the £100 million plus that the Government have put in additionally to the health service, which the Conservative Party would never have supported, will make a real difference in treating older people at the point of care when they need it most. That expenditure on the health service will ensure that older people get a better deal from the national health service in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has accepted an invitation to be guest speaker at the National Old Age Pensioners Association in Wales annual conference on 7 June. I am a member of the inter-ministerial group on older people that is co-ordinating a national listening event to be held on 17 May in which pensioners from Wales have been invited to take part. This is another example of how the Government are committed to listening, and delivering real improvements, to older people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon.

May I draw his attention, and therefore that of all his inter-ministerial committees, to a significant group of pensioners whose pension income is above benefit level but below taxation level? They neither benefit from benefits, nor from the introduction of a 10 pence income tax starting rate. Will he and those who are consulting on these matters take particular account of this group of pensioners who fall between two stools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing that concern to my attention. As he has said, pensioners' tax allowances have risen. The 10 pence starting rate of tax has also had a major impact on benefits for pensioners. I will examine the issues he has raised and make sure they are examined carefully in the inter-ministerial group on older people. I will respond to him in writing in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon.

This is about pensioners who are entitled to income support but are not getting it at the moment. We are in the process of ensuring they claim what they are entitled to. Would he also mention that under the last Government, there were about 1 million pensioners who had entitlement to income support but who were not encouraged to take it up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for bringing that matter to the attention of the Committee. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and, indeed, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, are very keen to promote the take-up campaign, which the Government initiated last week, on the minimum income guarantee and on the range of benefits that are available to pensioners. These pensioners' benefits are not charity: they are benefits as of right. It is important that pensioners establish their rights to these benefits and receive them. The Government are encouraging people to contact a
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
helpline number, which, sadly, I do not have to hand. However, I am sure that the number can be made available to hon. Members at a later date. It is important that pensioners take up those benefits as of right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say that many of my constituents live on basic state benefits, as do my parents. I do not need any lessons from the Conservative party about pensioners' treatment. The Conservative party cut the link. This Government are trying to establish positive measure to improve pensioners' lives. There were no heating allowances, free television licences for over-75s or minimum income guarantees under the Conservative party. Pensions were cut in real terms during that period. The Labour party is proud of its record. We are doing what we can, and we will do more. We will certainly fight the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I have regular meetings with the First Secretary and Assembly Members to discuss children's issues in Wales. We are the first Government to make a commitment to end child poverty in 20 years, and to halve it within 10 years. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced additional measures in his Budget statement, such as the increase in child benefit, which will assist in child poverty prevention. Our policies will tackle all aspects of poverty and social exclusion across the UK. In addition, the National Assembly for Wales has set up a social inclusion unit to consider poverty issues and promote effective joint working on such issues in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite a lengthy reply, but I missed part of it because an hon. Member has been wandering around the Room since the beginning of the Committee. It would be a good idea if he were told to sit down. On child poverty, I have kept a lot of notes on what the Labour Government have done in the past three years. All Committee members see child poverty in their constituencies, whether because of neglect by the parents, lack of attention or insufficient funding towards the alleviation of child poverty. An amount of £4.30 a week—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening for the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a question. Is that amount of money sufficient to alleviate child poverty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have set ambitious targets to tackle child poverty and are delivering, in real cash terms, to mothers in Wales and elsewhere. For example, the increase in child benefit from £11 when we came into office to £15.50 is a major increase in resources to help to tackle child poverty. If that is coupled with the working families tax credit, which benefits more than 60,000 people in Wales, the average family will gain £22 a week. Those are real resources; coupled with the education resources allocated in the Budget, it means that we are helping, over time, to alleviate the problem of child poverty and giving people a good start in life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (I welcome the measures that my hon. Friend announced to combat poverty in the next 10 to 20 years, which will make a significant difference. Does he recall that the previous Government had no strategy for combating child poverty and did not even recognise the concept? I remind him that when the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs visited Llwynu school last week it was struck by the social deprivation suffered by the children and their parents. The school keeps a store of clothes and shoes for children whose own clothes and shoes are inadequate. The head teacher spends up to a third of her time on child protection issues and one class contains 43 children. The Government are committed to class sizes of no more than 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds. Will my hon. Friend ask the Assembly why large class sizes have persisted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall examine the points that my hon. Friend raised. The Government, in co-operation with the National Assembly for Wales, are on target to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
reduce class sizes before the next general election to the level set out in our manifesto. The extra resources in the Budget on education matters will go a long way to achieving that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the support given to parents through the new deal for lone parents and to the £5 million invested in the national child strategy in Wales. The Government recognise that child poverty is a major block on the aspirations of many young people to grow effectively in the community and to achieve their full potential. Our measures go a long way to meeting those aims; as my hon. Friend said, 18 years of Conservative Government did nothing to achieve the objectives that we set in three years of Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that families with young children are the poorest group in society and that the creation of a children's commissioner will help to tackle poverty among children by highlighting inequalities? Wales is leading in the United Kingdom in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. Following the publication of the Waterhouse report, my right hon.

Friend in a meeting this evening to explore the matter further.

Since the general election, the national health service in Wales has received new moneys totalling £291.6 million. Next year, it will receive £2.8 billion, an increase of £182 million. As a result of the Budget, a further £1.3 billion will be sent by the Government to Wales to help support the National Assembly in its budget cycle. That means additional resources for the national health service and solid support for Wales, which will help to reduce inequalities. Once again, the Conservative party would not have supported that funding with its tax guarantee and it would not have appeared in a Conservative Budget. The resources will be beneficial to Wales and will support growing health expenditure in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Budget statement and its implications for Wales.</p></blockquote>
This is the second debate of the Welsh Grand Committee since devolution. I believe that the role of Welsh Members of Parliament, all 40 of us, in the House of Commons is enhanced by the existence of the Committee. It gives us, and others, an opportunity to discuss matters relating to Wales, particularly those that affect the responsibility of the House of Commons. There are many, because many matters are still reserved to Westminster and are not devolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are dealing specifically with the implications of the Budget and how that deals with taxation, fiscal policies and other matters. However, that is not the only thing with which the Committee deals and which affects the lives of Welsh people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say how much I agree with what the Secretary of State has just said about the importance of the Welsh Grand Committee.

Will he therefore say why he believes that only half the members who are eligible to attend this Committee are actually in attendance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I cannot comment on individual Members of Parliament and their commitments. They may be on Standing Committees. All that I know is that this is a forum for members representing Welsh constituencies to deal with matters relating to Wales. I have no doubt that as this debate goes on, as they usually do, through the course of the day, there will be opportunities for hon. Members of the House of Commons to come here to make their contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend spoke in his initial statement
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
about the role of the Grand Committee. May I draw to his attention the problems that have already started to rise about how we scrutinise legislation in this House where Welsh provisions are contained in a Bill—the Learning and Skills Bill is a classic example? Should we not explore the possibility of either the Grand Committee or the Select Committee playing a pre-legislative role as well as the Assembly Secretaries and the Assembly Committees? We, too, should have a function in the pre-legislative stages of legislation dealing with Welsh affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much merit in what my hon. Friend says. In many ways we are all learning in this post-devolution period about the relationship between ourselves and the Assembly and that between Members of Parliament and Assembly Members. In particular, we are learning about the way in which the Houses of Parliament deal with primary legislation. That is still a matter for Westminster, and occupies the time of not only Welsh Members but hon. Members generally. I know that the Welsh Affairs Committee is considering those matters and that the Procedure Committee has dealt with them too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in the process of establishing a protocol between ourselves and the Assembly to deal with issues connected with primary legislation. We are considering the possibility of a fast track for Welsh-only legislation, and whether this Committee can play a part in that. As my hon. Friend said, we should consider how we operate from a pre-legislative angle, too. After all, if the partnership between those of us who represent Welsh people in the House and those who represent them in the Assembly is genuine, it is obviously best for all of us to consider the most efficient and democratic ways of resolving those matters. The Assembly in new, and there is an awful lot of work to do to discover precisely how we can co-operate with it to pass legislation.

There are huge areas of legislation that are centred on Westminster and impact on the lives of Welsh men and women, of which the most important in recent months has been the Budget, and the way in which taxation and fiscal policies relate to Welsh people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the Barnett formula is important to some of the poorest areas in Wales, and indeed to all of Wales, and that on average we get something in the region of £350 more per person than our counterparts in England? Would he also care to comment on the distribution of that money through the block grant to local authorities? In the recent distribution, Phil Williams, the nationalist Member for my area, refused to support the addition of £5 million from that programme, which was desperately needed for our community. Without that money, services would have been slashed and council tax would have gone up by 50 per cent. How does that fit in with the description of the nationalist party as the party of Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answering one of the questions, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary referred to the formula. I believe that the formula needs the serious consideration that the Assembly is giving it. We must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
ensure that the most deprived areas in Wales are dealt with in a special way, but at the same time the formula must be fair and transparent. I hope that the Assembly will arrive at an adequate formula during the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Barnett formula has served Wales well over two decades. It recognises the fact that Wales is clearly, from a variety of indicators, one of the poorest parts of the United Kingdom. That is why two thirds of Wales is covered by objective 1 status. We need to raise our gross domestic product and increase our wealth. The Assembly must take that into account in distributing finance and its own funding to different parts of Wales; it is not for me to go into further details about how the Assembly manages its business. However, having worked in my hon. Friend's constituency for 17 years, I understand the points that he makes about his constituency in the heads of the valley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the Secretary of State's point about the Barnett formula and its effect on Wales, would he not accept that it has caused a convergence over the past 20 years between the Welsh and English spending Departments? It was designed to bring Welsh and English spending closer together. We are reaching a point at which spending on the most deprived areas of Wales will in fact decline, not increase. The formula does not preserve extra spending, but works towards convergence. In that context, were not the proposals that my party made in the National Assembly—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, it is true. Look at the details. My party put forward the proposal that full additionality should come in this year for objective 1—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the hon. Gentleman would prefer a formula that was better for Wales. We shall of course consider all the ways in which we can maximise the Assembly's ability to spend its money. However, we have to be careful that in devising another, we do not go from the frying pan into the fire because of the complications. I understand the point about convergence, but it is still a fact that, as my hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) said, spending per head in Wales is significantly higher than the United Kingdom average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to prolong the proceedings but, whatever formula is used at the end of the day, is it not a fact that the amount of public expenditure that comes to Wales from all sources far exceeds the money that is raised in Wales from taxation? That is the real issue. Whatever formula is used, it cannot affect that basic point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I are at one in saying that, were the people of Wales ever misguidedly to vote for independence and separation, they would be infinitely worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered a very important Budget. Although it was based on the United Kingdom, it has enormous implications for the people of Wales.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Because it delivers stability, security and strength, it will be good for Welsh taxpayers, businesses and public services. We can do nothing in Wales to improve the health service, education, transport or any other public service without a solid, firm and secure foundation. It is recognised by everyone—even, grudgingly, by the Opposition, and certainly internationally—that the strength of the British economy since the election of the Labour Government in 1997 has increased enormously. Because my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been prudent and wise, inflation and mortgage rates are low and, as a consequence of a properly managed economy, people in Wales will inevitably benefit not only from better public services but from the changes that have been made to the taxation system and the help that has been given to businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Secretary of State and I agree with a certain amount of what he says, but is it not also true that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has kept the pound far too high, disadvantaging both manufacturing industry and farming?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the relationship between the euro and the pound. On the euro, the hon. Gentleman knows the position of his party and that of the Government. We are looking carefully at the situation and making the necessary preparations, but we have to satisfy the conditions that the Chancellor has laid down for the benefit of the British people. It will also be the subject of a referendum so that, ultimately, we have to wait and see what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, there is no question in my mind that manufacturing output is now higher than it has ever been. It increased by 0.7 per cent. in the three months to December, an annualised rate of more than 3 per cent., showing that industry and agriculture are helped above all else by the strength of the economy. If we go back to the days of boom and bust and of not knowing where we are, that cannot help British or Welsh manufacturing by any stretch of the imagination. The only way by which we can ensure that manufacturing prospers in Wales is to maintain a strong and stable economy. That is why inflation is low—no one wants to go back to the bad old days of high inflation—why 42,000 extra jobs have come to Wales in the past three years and why confidence in business is so high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand all the difficulties being experienced by farmers and I shall come to that later. The hon. Gentleman knows that during the past week the Government has taken important measures to help farming with monetary compensation because of the strength of the pound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all accept entirely what the Secretary of State has said. He will be aware that what BMW did to Rover will have an effect on car component firms in Wales, certainly in my constituency. He will also be aware that the Department of Trade and Industry has set up a task force to look at Longbridge. Will he ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to ensure that the task force also considers how to help those Welsh component firms which were linked to Rover and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
which will be substantially affected and lose sales, such as Calsonic in Llanelli and Pressings, which is owned by a German company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. I discussed such matters yesterday with the First Secretary, and I propose to discuss the implications of Rover for Wales with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry as soon as possible. Such matters affect my constituency as it does that of my right hon. Friend. Tomorrow morning, I shall be meeting representatives from what used to be Lucas Girling in my constituency to see how the Rover situation will affect them. Nearly 3,000 people in Torfaen work in car component factories and, clearly, they will be affected by what has occurred in the midlands. My right hon. Friend may rest assured that I shall raise such matters with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now return to the taxation aspect of the Budget. The basic rate of income tax has been cut to 22 pence. It is the lowest rate for 70 years, and 1.1 million people in Wales will benefit from that cut. By 2001–02, employees on low earnings will not have to pay national insurance contributions. That is worth £160 a year to someone on the national minimum wage. Taking the working families tax credit and the income tax changes together, families earning up to £255 a week will pay no net income tax. We are hoping to build a third national insurance system. About 10,000 low-paid people in Wales will not have to pay national insurance and their benefit entitlement will be protected. The new deal for lone parents choices package will benefit about 35,000 parents with children over the age of five in Wales. The national minimum wage now benefits upwards of 100,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not forget the two employment zones—one in the heads of the valleys and Caerphilly, and another in north-west Wales—which were launched on 9 March. They aim to provide tailored help for about 3,000 long-term unemployed people. By 2001, personal tax and benefit changes in this and previous Budgets will mean that households with children will be, on average, £850 a year better off. More than 350,000 households in Wales will benefit from the increased Government spending on support for children. We all known the importance to Welsh people of the working families tax credit, given that about 60,000 families receive it or are in the transition period from family credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has been running through the positive sides of the balance sheet, but will he now run through its negative sides? Will he tell us that the total tax burden as a result of the Budget has risen from 35.3 per cent. to 37.4 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what immediately affects my constituents. When I talk to people in the towns and villages, they know what has happened to them and whether they have benefited from the working families tax credit as they do from the increase in child benefit. They know whether they have benefited from the reduction in income tax to its lowest level for many years. All those changes combined make eminently good sense in ensuring that people will be better off as a consequence of the Government's actions and their
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Budget. In particular, the poorest in our society are being helped year on year by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. All the flamboyant rhetoric in the world will not detract from the reality that people in Wales are better off because of the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pensions have already been mentioned. No one can deny that the poorest pensioners in Wales—of whom there are a fair number—will be better off as a result of Government actions. The winter fuel payment has increased from £100 to £150, which will benefit nearly 500,000 Welsh pensioners. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) referred to pensioners who have managed to save. They will be rewarded by increases in the capital limits attached to the minimum income guarantee. Indeed, that guarantee means exactly what it says, and many pensioners in Wales benefit directly from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Measures introduced so far in this Parliament mean that, on average, pensioner households will be £400 a year better off, with the poorest of those over 75 up to £950 a year better off. More than 200,000 people over 75 in Wales will benefit from free television licences. Pensioners in Wales—especially the poorest—are benefiting directly from the decisions of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon. Friends said that we were helping businesses in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many pensioners living in Wales are between 60 and 75? Does the Secretary of State believe that an increase in the television licence fee which is above the rate of inflation will benefit them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are about 390,000 such pensioners. We cannot do everything straight away. No Government could. A strong Budget statement and secure economy will ensure that, over the years, the lives of pensioners will improve. That will be a direct result of our measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small and medium-sized businesses are the future of Wales. The days of large factories and plants coming to Wales will probably not return, although we still hope to get some such works. In rural areas especially, smaller and medium-sized business need to be encouraged, which is why 29,000 businesses have benefited directly from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's measures on capital gains tax and the corporation tax. Since 1997, the Government have cut the average corporation tax bill for small companies by almost a quarter and are maintaining the low tax rate that has helped to make the United Kingdom, including Wales, a competitive environment for business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Right hon. Gentleman rightly emphasises that small businesses are the key to the economic regeneration of rural areas. When can they start applying for objective 1 funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is a matter for the Assembly. It is not, and should not be, a matter for the United Kingdom Government. That is what devolution is all about. The programme is lengthy, extending over seven years, and is important for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The other side of any Budget is spending. Earlier, I said that one cannot spend recklessly if one has a weak economy. However, one can spend sensibly if one has a strong economy. By any measure, the £1.4 billion extra that has come to Wales as a direct result of the Budget is the biggest boost that we have had for the health service, education and transport for many years. Opposition parties begrudged us that and grumbled a bit in the Assembly and the House of Commons. However, they cannot seriously fail to agree, applaud or rejoice that there is an extra £1.2 billion for the health service, which is the biggest ever increase for the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That increase has been made as a result of our priority for the health service. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the First Secretary and the First Minister for Scotland will, together, with the respective Secretaries of State and other relevant Ministers, discuss how we can reform and modernise the way in which the health service delivers now that it has been given the case to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was on education. It amounted to £50 million next year for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has been generous in giving way to us. Will not the extra cash that is available for health offer a real opportunity to create a direct link between health resources and deprivation? We have campaigned for such a link for years. It was difficult to achieve when resources were tight, but now we have an opportunity to create a proper distribution relationship between health resources and areas of deprivation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several of my hon. Friends have raised that matter with me in relation to the valleys and elsewhere. It has been said that the formula under which money goes to the health service should take deprivation into account in so far as it affects the poorest parts of Wales. I have raised the matter with the First Secretary and the Health and Social Services Secretary in Wales. Obviously, it is for the Assembly to decide how to approach it. However, we are making appropriate representations. Indeed, now is the time for us to examine and review how best to spend the money and to go straight to the heart of the greatest health problems in Wales. We are talking not only about the £99 million that will go directly from the Exchequer to Wales next year for health spending, because the Assembly will make that figure up to £110 million. That shows how a Labour Government and a Labour Administration in Wales can work together to improve the health of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution means ultimately that it is for the Assembly to decide whether to spend all the £1.47 billion that was awarded to Wales as a consequence of the formula and the read-across from the amount that the Chancellor gave the United Kingdom. The Assembly could have chosen to spend the money on something else, because that is the nature of devolution. The Assembly gets the money and it makes the decisions and decides the priorities. However, it has been wise. The proposals in the Assembly are that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
amounts that were allocated for health, education and transport will go to precisely those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is slightly different because the statistics mean that the Assembly can ensure that every school in Wales will get an allocation of money for books and equipment, as do schools in England. In addition, £29 million has been set aside to ensure that school buildings, which really need attention, are looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the start of my remarks, none of that would have been possible if my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not ensured that we have a strong, stable and secure economy. The prudence that he has exercised over the past few years has meant that we can go ahead and ensure that services in Wales improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should touch on the state of agriculture, even though the Budget did not refer directly to it. Such matters are important to us all. The Committee will be aware that, as a result of the agriculture summit last week and of the Government's decisions, extra money will be given to Wales. Some £15 million will be set aside for the less-favoured areas. There will be £2.3 million of agri-money for dairy farmers, £2.5 million for beef farmers, £6 million for sheep farmers, and a share, with Scotland and Northern Ireland, of the £2 million for business consultancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Downing Street summit last week showed the Government's commitment to recognising the crisis in farming? Does he also agree that agri-monetary compensation is the most important measure that the Goverment could have introduced for farmers in Wales? Does he recall that under the Conservative Government not one penny piece of agri-monetary compensation went to farmers in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That says it all. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary in the Assembly were present at the agriculture summit. That shows again that the partnership between the Assembly and the Government is working. Together, we can tackle the problems of rural areas in Wales. For many weeks, the farming community has asked for agri-monetary compensation because of the strength of the pound. Now it has that, as a direct result of the Government and the Assembly working together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a Budget for all Britain and all Wales. It is based on prudence and was made possible by the underlying strength of our economy. It will strengthen our pubic services, especially the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that a number of people in Wales are as confused as I am about the two rates of inflation. The indexation of people's tax allowances was in line with a rate of inflation of 1.2 per cent. The duty on fuel, however, was raised by a rate of inflation of 3.2 per cent. Why do two rates operate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will write to the hon. Gentleman about the details, but that intervention was about as obscure as the comments made by Mr. Bourne, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
leader of the Conservatives in Wales, when he was asked how he thought that money should be spent. Instead of saying that it should be spent on the health service, he talked about landowners' compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It strikes me that the hon. Gentleman should understand what matters to people in Wales. I have told him and the rest of the Committee about increases in the health budget, education funding and transport, along with reductions in taxation, and help for small businesses. All that will go directly to help the people of Wales. Whatever the different percentages are, what ultimately matters is how people in Wales are affected—how businesses, taxpayers and public services are affected? There is no question that the Budget is the best in years for Welsh people, yet, all that the hon. Gentleman can do is carp about some detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have his chance in a minute; then I can intervene in his speech. The Conservatives reacted in the same way in the Assembly debate. They did not know what to do because they were so gobsmacked by the increases in health, education and transport. They were either lost for words or saying words that meant little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget has demonstrated that, although devolution means that there will be policy differences between Wales and the rest of Britain, it will be the partnership between the Labour Government and the Labour-led Assembly that will set the tone. The Budget was welcomed in the House, in the United Kingdom, in Wales and in every constituency represented by hon. Members here today. I commend the Budget to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I sound a bit basso profundo this morning, it is not because I have discovered the elixir of life, but merely because I have sinusitis. I hope that my voice will last the course.

We are rapidly approaching the end of the third year of the Government's tenure of the economy. It is a time to be judged and to look forward to see whether salvation lies around the corner—real salvation, not false predictions of it. I will try to be fair in my analysis of what the Government have done in the Budget, because it certainly contains some good measures. Other measures that should have been included, however, have been omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Chancellors put a gloss on their Budgets, but no amount of elbow grease can disguise the fact that the Chancellor and the Government made a tactical error in slavishly following the previous Conservative Government's expenditure plans for their first two
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
years in office. The electorate expected the Government to follow their own agenda, not that of the Conservatives, in their management of the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to set the record straight on the policy of the hon. Gentleman's party. As I understand it, his party's manifesto said that the figures in its costing supplement were
	<br><blockquote><p>the changes to the existing</p></blockquote>
Conservative
	<br><blockquote><p>Government revenue and spending plans arising from the Liberal Democrats' Manifesto commitments. With the exception of the specified costed items, all Departments will have to work within current spending plans.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that the Budget was prudent. It would be imprudent of anyone not to manage the economy soundly, as the Chancellor stressed in his Budget speech. It has taken longer for results to flow in the key areas of education and health, which we all agree have been the prime matters of concern. I agree that assistance for the lower paid has been useful. The Liberal Democrats welcome the minimum wage and the working families tax credit. We also welcome the total expenditure that will go into Wales, to which the Secretary of State has alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In judging the Chancellor's so-called prudent Budget, it is revealing to draw up a balance sheet. On the plus side, it is good that NHS expenditure has increased by an amount almost identical to that which the Liberal Democrats advocated before the Budget. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Labour Members should not carp about that; I was trying to praise the Government. If they want to reject that praise, I could be much tougher on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee precisely where that funding would have come from, given that the penny-in-the-pound tax increase proposed by the Liberal Democrats would not have raised the sum that we have provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The money would have come from a combination of increasing the price of cigarettes and not cutting income tax by a penny in the pound. It is well known that that was our policy. In other words, the standard rate of tax would have remained at 23 pence in the pound. We did not think it necessary to cut tax by a penny in the pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increased expenditure on the NHS is welcome, as are the tax breaks for small and medium businesses. The repayment of debt—there is now a surplus overall—is also welcome because debt repayments implode the Chancellor's Budget. The penny cut in the standard rate of tax was less good; it was introduced to please middle England, not Wales. That money would have been far better spent in the way in which I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the minus side, nothing has been done to alleviate the high value of the pound, which is crucifying manufacturing and farming in Wales. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
absence of any indication of match funding in the Budget for objectives 1 and 2 is scandalous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that nothing has been done for farmers, but does he not accept that the measures taken at last week's agriculture summit on agri-money compensation is precisely that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment on the summit later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain amount of smoke and mirrors are involved in match funding in the current year. The comprehensive spending review is a device to delay spending commitments, and we are losing out on match funding as a result. All I hear is promises, promises, but we shall wait and see. Next year will almost certainly be an election year, and the Budget prefaces that. No one will be surprised if an anorexic rabbit is eventually pulled out of the bag.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pensioners received a disappointing hearing from the Chancellor on their rightful demand for more money. They will receive only an additional 72 pence a week. The Liberal Democrats would have given pensioners £2 a week more. I agree that they benefited from other measures, such as free television licenses, which they welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Liberal Democrats have given pensioners £2 in addition to the £3 a week winter fuel allowance that pensioners receive on average and the £100 for television licences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, they would have received money in addition to those two payments, which we obviously welcome. Pensioners want more money in their pockets, and all those of us with a social conscience ought to be prepared to meet that demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can also be critical of the Chancellor's inability to clamp down on the banks in their efforts to close large chunks of the branch networks, although I congratulate the National Assembly on its decision to reward Barclays bank for its branch closures by withdrawing the Assembly's accounts. That is constructive: if we hit the banks in the pocket, perhaps they will listen at last.

The National Assembly now prioritises spending. I understand that as a result of the Budget, an additional £158 million is available in the current year to spend. Of course, there would have been another £140 million without the 1 pence tax cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We very much welcome the additional spending of £110 million of the NHS. However, the health authorities' debt throughout Wales is considerable, and I ask that the extra money not be used to lift too much of that debt. The additional money needs to go directly to patients. In my part of the world, beds are being closed by health authority stictures to cut funding. That is wrong; the debt question must be addressed differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was possible to break the rule about advance announcements by making statements on NHS spending, which I believe was the correct priority. Why could the Chancellor not do the same for objective 1
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
matched funding? It is inconsistent for him to do it in one sector, but not in another. There is still a problem with local authority underfunding and high council tax, which is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will note that social services departments in Wales are severely underfunded, and that that is contributing to bed blocking in the NHS. A lot of NHS expenditure goes on patients remaining in hospitals. That money could be used to bring other patients into hospital sooner. The problem of bed blocking exists because social services departments are poverty-stricken, and something must be done about that. Obviously, we welcome the announcement of more nurses, who are vital. There is a long way to go, but at least we have made a start. The Government are fond of talking about joined-up Government, and something has to be joined up between social services and the NHS. It is very much a question of the allocation of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh economy is in a serious situation. I acknowledge that there are more jobs since the general election. However, we would be extremely foolish not to note the result of the high pound. As we know, manufacturing industry represents 27 per cent. of the Welsh economy. We have only to consider BMW's ditching of Rover to realise what can happen. At present, there are 25,000 jobs in the car industry in Wales, of which 18,000 directly involve component manufacture. The right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) mentioned the catastrophic situation at Calsonic, where 500 jobs will be lost as a result of the Rover situation. Perhaps BMW protests too much about the fact that we are not in the euro-zone. We all know the argument that the value of the pound should be closer to that of the euro. Nevertheless, the high pound threatens at least one of the Welsh steel plants, probably the one at Llanwern. That is serious and needs to be resolved urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we have an overvalued currency; the problem is how to tackle it. The matter is not within the Chancellor's direct control and is largely the result of the weak euro. Does the Chancellor have a constructive way of bringing down the value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the weak euro has benefited manufacturing industry in Germany, France and other parts of the EU enormously. The problem is that the Monetary Policy Committee, which advises the Chancellor, has depended too much on a one-club economic policy that has concentrated on interest rates and has kept the value of the pound too high to be competitive for British manufacturing industry. That is quite a problem that will cause us disastrous job cuts if we are not careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh economy, it should not be forgotten, has been dependent, particularly over the past 15 years or so, on inward investment from Japan, Korea, the United States and other parts of the world. Those countries and manufacturers invested in Wales because they wanted to get into the EU and to export to the rest of the EU. But they are being crucified by the high pound. We wanted to hear what Toyota said about the importance of joining the euro.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always fascinated by Liberal Democrat economics. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the Liberal Democrat party would take back control of interest rates from the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England and halve interest rates? Perhaps he could tell us what the inflationary consequences would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that doing things all of a sudden is inadvisable. It is necessary to bring the pound down by stages and to get some kind of convergence with what is going on in Europe rather more rapidly than the Chancellor's present policy. Three years ago, Lucas Rists in Ystradgynlais in my constituency employed 2,000 people and supplied harnesses to the Rover group. Those jobs reduced over two years to 1,000 and then the whole shooting match went to Poland when Lucas pulled out of production. That was due in part to the high value of the pound. Those jobs have already gone. A great job has been done by the taskforce and I acknowledge its help in the Swansea valley, but it has only replaced those jobs with about 10 per cent. of the jobs that were there previously. That is quite serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factory in my constituency is Motorway Retreads at Knighton, which 18 months ago employed 150 people. They now employ 28 people because recycled tyres are uncompetitive in the world market and production has gone to Brazil. That is happening all over Wales and we are becoming partly de-industrialised. The importance of the euro and joining it earlier rather than later is becoming vital. It is not just BMW that talks about the euro, but Toyota and others. I hope that the steel industry is not involved, but there has been a link-up between British Steel and a Dutch firm in Wales. It supplies a lot of steel for the car industry for Volvo production in Holland, and that steel production may go elsewhere. We have to be quick off the mark about this. I am sure that the Secretary of State and the First Secretary are discussing those matters daily with the Welsh Development Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 25,000 manufacturing jobs in the car industry and 22,000 people are directly involved in farming. With their families, those numbers are almost doubled. Those are two important factors in the Welsh economy. The situation for farming has been disastrous. I represent the biggest farming constituency in Wales and the farming community is grateful for what was done by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and others at the Downing Street summit last week. We are particularly grateful for the long-term aspects of parts of that settlement. As for exporting or importing food, the industry faces a 20 per cent. hurdle of disadvantage because of the high pound. This is a serious matter because the National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales were asking for £450 million of agri-monetary compensation for the UK as a whole. That was for the year 1999–2000, and was money that the farmers did not get for their produce in that year. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had a hard time negotiating with the Chancellor to get any money from the Treasury for that. In the end, they got £66 million for the whole of the UK for agri-monetary compensation. Totting up the figures that the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
of State gave us, that works out at about £13 million. The Chancellor still has a £6 billion war chest, which he will presumably spend on the general election. That £66 million of agri-monetary compensation is 1 per cent. of that war chest. It is practically nothing. The demand for £450 million of agri-monetary compensation was justified because the farmers should have had that money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's arithmetic is out again. There is a surplus in the order of £6 billion. If he recalls, the figure last week for the farmers was £200 million. That is 3 per cent. of the total figure and the farmers comprise less than 3 per cent. of the working population. Therefore, on a percentage basis, they get much more than their share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman will recognise that £60 million of that money will not come until 2001. Some of the other money went on pigs, which hardly exist any longer in Wales, so the matter is not quite as simple as the hon. Gentleman is trying to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman also take into account in his remarks on the agri-money compensation scheme the fact that it is just for the one year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be for every year if we are successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the promise, is it? The line has been given that it is for this year only. There could be 66 per cent. of the money available next year, then 50 per cent. and then a tapering off. We are not making as much use as we could of the agri-money compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That is true. Many will say that the way out for the Welsh economy is to up-skill the Welsh labour force and diversify the economy. Most of us would agree with that. It is desirable, however, to go much further than that. One has only to listen to economic advisers in Wales to hear that we are behind as far as information technology is concerned and we need to do a lot about that. Quite a lot of training in information technology is going on, but there needs to be more. I know that there is money in the budget to bring that about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that 27 per cent. of the Welsh economy depends on manufacturing, it is difficult for Wales suddenly to turn around and produce a service economy. That cannot be done in five minutes. I should like to see still more investment in retraining. That is vital, and the Welsh Development Agency must bring in more leading-edge companies or, preferably, create within Wales indigenous companies that can bring about a revolution and a transition. However, that will take a long time. In the meantime, we must not lose too much of our manufacturing industry, otherwise we shall be in a difficult position. The high pound is undermining matters. There is no doubt that, if agriculture were in the euro-zone, it would be profitable. Farms in Europe that are half the size of ours in Wales make a profit and families can live off them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, obviously we welcome what has happened to the national health service and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
congratulate the Government on that. All I can say about objective 1 match funding is, "Now we see it, now we don't". At the time of the comprehensive spending review in July, we shall know a little more about such matters. If tax cuts had not been made, more money could have been put into the public sector and business. The £20 billion trade deficit has been increased by £10 billion as a result of the Budget. The situation in Rover and other manufacturing industries needs watching. Farming needs even more targeted assistance for it to get through the long term. The Government have started to make the right decisions, but they still have a long way to go. The Budget was one for a general election, which is likely to be next year. I expect that there will be another Budget next spring to eke out some of the money in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's war chest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.56 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones, for calling me to speak so early in the debate. I waited for three-and-a-half hours to be called during the Welsh affairs debate, so it makes up for that. I pay tribute to you for securing the £530 million aid package for British Aerospace. Without grovelling, I must say that you are a shining example to new Members of Parliament, such as me, of how we should represent our constituents and fight for them to secure employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also express solidarity with the case for the National Assembly to make additional resources available to secure such an important project for the Welsh economy. We need the cutting-edge technology that British Aerospace has developed during the past 30 years and we should not jeopardise that. We are all aware of the current impasse. I have made my own representations to the First Secretary and I hope that there is room for compromise on such issues and that additional funds can be given by the National Assembly to ensure that the project comes to north Wales and does not go to other areas of the United Kingdom or, indeed, abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the effect of the Budget on my constituency and on Wales. As an ex-school teacher who taught from 1982 to 1997 throughout the Conservative years, I was acutely aware of the lack of the funding in education in Wales. Year-on-year, cuts sapped morale and built up a backlog of repairs, and we witnessed a massive growth in class sizes. The Conservatives said that class sizes did not matter. However, in the main they did not send their children to state schools where the size of classes did not matter, but to private schools where class sizes did matter. The extra £49 million for education in Wales has been well received in my constituency and the provisional spending allocated by the National Assembly of £20 million—yet to be ratified—for schools through the LEAs and the £25 million for capital build and repairs will help to tackle the Tory legacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main part of my speech concerns health expenditure. The increases announced in the Budget are the biggest in the history of the national health service—a 35 per cent. real terms increase in funding over a four-year period. That reflects Labour's belief in
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the NHS, which we created in 1947 and shows the difference between the outlook and philosophy of the Tories and Labour on it. Labour believes in investment, growth and modernisation, whereas the Tories implemented cuts, decline and privatisation. The Prime Minister has given the necessary funding to the NHS, and is determined to modernise it and make sure that the poorest performing health authorities raise their standards to those of the best performing. That is a laudable aim, which can be achieved. We have the goodwill of the NHS and all who work in it to help us achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my right hon. friend do something to combat a specific problem in the NHS, to which I want to direct the burden of my speech—the low pay of many key workers? Recently, I spent two and a half hours in the pathology department of Ysbyty Glan Clwyd general hospital in my constituency. I was taken on a tour by David Nuttall and Gareth Wynne Williams, who are two committed professionals. They took me around the four sections of the pathology department, and I spoke to dozens of workers. I shared tea and coffee with them and listened to their concerns. I was most impressed by their dedication and professionalism. They work in one of the most unglamorous hospital departments. They examine diseased tissue and human blood, faeces and urine, playing a central role in helping to develop a modern, efficient NHS. Without their input, our hospitals would close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Medical laboratory scientific officers must now hold a bachelor of science degree as a minimum qualification for entrance into the profession. Despite having GCSEs, A-levels and at least one degree, the pay rates for these professionals are unbelievably low. I was introduced to a medical laboratory scientific officer, who had six months; experience and was on just £7,726 per year. A further two years' service is necessary before becoming state registered. That is barely above the statutory minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask Committee members to look at a picture that was published in the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> last week. It is of a Mr. Anderson Figoeirdo, who works outside the House of Commons in Westminster square. His job is to hold a sign on the end of a pole, which says, "Café this way". I do not want to belittle that gentleman, who has a job to do, but his wage of £5 an hour is the equivalent of £10,000 a year. In comparison, detecting disease in hospitals is a very important job, and deserves pay rates that are commensurate with it. To draw a more realistic analogy, the starting rate for a graduate in manufacturing is £17,700 a year. Graduates in the service sector receive £18,800 a year and those in the financial sector receive £17,700, while the average for all graduates starting is £18,600 a year. That compares with £7,700 a year for an MLSO. The poor pay levels do not improve over time, and experience is not rewarded. In the same hospital, I met an MLSO with ten years' service who was on just £15,000 a year. I spoke to a senior scientist on a level 2, who had worked for 29 years and was on just £23,000 a year. If that man's wife did not work, his family would be eligible for the minimum rate of working families tax credit of £11 a week. That is no way to treat professionals. Is it right that those who have studied for GCSEs, A-levels and degrees should be rewarded with pay levels 25 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
less than those of pole holders? Is it right that dedicated professionals who have given 29 years of loyalty, dedication and professionalism to the NHS should claim state benefits? Is it right that graduates starting careers as scientists in the NHS will have a pay rate £11,000 less than the average for graduates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I toured the department, I detected the bitterness, anger and resentment of workers which, in many cases, was justified. One of the main reasons for such low pay levels is that scientists and many other groups in the NHS are not included in the NHS pay review body, having been taken out many years ago. Since then, their pay has fallen by as much as 30 per cent. compared with that of doctors and nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not playing one group of health workers off against another, as doctors and nurses deserve the pay increases that they have received over the years. The Government have now addressed funding, the key NHS issue. The NHS was in a sick state after 18 years of under-funding by the previous Conservative Government. We have remedied that and given the NHS a cash transfusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that his Government have remedied all the ills of the NHS. Why, therefore, did the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing say at its conference yesterday that there are only six months to save the NHS? Indeed, RCN Welsh secretary Liz Hewett said that that would be a tall order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman? I did not say that we have remedied all the ills of the NHS. After 18 years of Conservative rule, we cannot do that in two or three years. The project is long term and will take a generation, but we are providing the funding to do it. There will be no Trojan horse, death by a thousand cuts or privatisations from the Labour party. Those will come from the Conservative party, if and when it gets in again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members described our £21 billion extra for the NHS over the past three years as foolish and irresponsible. I should like to know how they will describe the extra 35 per cent. real terms increase over the next four years. We have put that money in place and must ensure that it reaches the parts that other packages of money have not reached, namely those in poorly paid jobs in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three grounds for saying that. First, it is morally right to reward hard work, long years of study, loyalty and dedication to the NHS. Secondly, the morale of those key workers is so low that the NHS will never recover until that key problem is addressed. Thirdly, it makes long-term economic sense to address the problem. If not, we shall lose those professionals and the loss will have an associated cost, as money that the country has spent on training and retraining those scientists will be lost. We shall then have to train new graduates to replace those scientists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will new graduates be available? I have tabled a battery of written questions on the costs of recruitment and retention of those key workers. I have been informed that barely a quarter of those who start
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
training remain in the NHS. On completion of their training, they are poached, largely by the private sector, which may please some. However, a growing demand for scientists in the economy means that their skills will become rarer and opportunities and pay levels outside the NHS will become more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are taking steps to address those problems. The document "Agenda for Change" recognises that pay and reward are problems for many workers in the NHS and sets out strategies for tackling that problem. The Government have said that they will review membership of the pay review body by April 2001. Extra cash has been injected into the NHS, and cash will be available in future. However, we must ensure that it is spent wisely and correctly. Will my right hon. Friend use his offices to address that at the Cabinet table and ensure that those key workers are rewarded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have sat on a Welsh Grant Committee and I welcome the opportunity to speak. I reiterate earlier comments about the importance of the Committee, post-devolution. It may have a role in the legislative process when we consider measures with a Welsh dimension. I refer especially to the Learning and Skills Bill, a significant portion of which relates to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the Chancellor's Budget statement on the Floor of the House, read the transcript of the debate on the Budget in the Welsh Assembly and listened today to the Secretary of State's contribution on the Budget as it affects Wales. In the Assembly debate, the Finance Secretary trumpeted the £1.4 billion extra spending in the Budget that would be directed to Wales and the figure was repeated today by the Secretary of State. The bulk of that extra spending is in health and education, which we do not question. I would expect an economy that is doing as well as the British economy—a result, dare I say it, of the legacy that the Government inherited from the Conservative Administration—to be able to spend well on good public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we question the distribution of some of that money within Wales. In respect of the spending on health and education. I re-emphasise for the benefit of Labour Members who sometimes have difficulty in remembering the increases in health service spending under the previous Government, that the Conservative party is committed to an efficient and effective national health service that is free at the point of delivery. It is not looking for privatisation or any other form of change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no concept of privatisation in the national health service. Like every Conservative Government since the introduction of the national health service, we are committed to a national health service that is available to all and free at the point of delivery. That commitment does not vary in any way from that of the present Government. If he is referring to privatisation in terms of public sector partnerships with the private sector, those are the policies of the present Government and of the previous Government. There is no change in the fundamental principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In education, the Conservative party recognises that the vast majority of the nation's children are educated in the state sector and we are committed to excellence in all our schools wherever they are and at whatever level. We would continue that commitment in government, as we did in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct that the percentage of GDP spent on health care in this country is one of the lowest in the world. I freely admit that in the United States, twice as much is spent on it, yet 35 million of its people remain outside health insurance. The point in question is efficiency and effectiveness. We have one of the most efficient and effective health care delivery systems in the world. The Conservatives are committed to continuing a health service of which we can all be proud because it is effective and efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to education. In view of the extra spending, it is ironic that our attitude to education today would give more power to schools to spend their budgets at school level. I sensed that that was the Chancellor's view and that of the Department for Education and Employment. It is ironic that it is not the view of the National Assembly, which believes that the resources would be better spent by local councillors than by those at the coal face in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important omission in the Budget statement has long been a topic of debate across the Floor of the House of Commons, and the Secretary of State has answered many questions about it from hon. Members on both sides. What is the future, in terms of Government spending, of objective 1, structural funds and match funding? The Chancellor announced an extra £1.4 billion for Wales, yet there was no mention whatever of a subject that has been on the agenda for a long time—the £1.2 billion that should be committed as match funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to engage in heavy party political dialogue about the efficacy of structural funds and the concept of match funding. The record of the previous Government was consistent: they operated schemes—whether through structural or other funds—for the benefit of the United Kingdom in all parts of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The discussion in which the shadow Chief Secretary was involved was about the theory of, and necessity for, structural funding. He based his views on the fact that areas of the United Kingdom would not need that funding with a more vibrant economy. That does not alter the fact that vast areas of Wales qualify for objective 1 funding. Structural funds have been the subject of negotiations in Berlin. The Government committed themselves to £1.2 billion of match funding, and the Prime Minister gave a commitment not to let Wales down. The only commitment that the Secretary of State has made so far is to hold discussions with the Chief Secretary as part of the next comprehensive spending review. We have seen no Government commitment whatever on the money available for structural funds and the National Assembly scratched together a tiny commitment to provide some match funding for the current year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Chancellor made a lot of commitments in his Budget, many of which go beyond the current financial year, including the £1.4 billion commitment for Wales. However, he was silent about objective 1, structural funds and match funding. That has led to uncertainty in Wales and, in particular, in the Welsh business community. The events of just the past 24 hours highlight the point, with the Government's mishandling of the Rover situation leading to job losses in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Government's response to the Rover situation is a lot better than the previous Government's response to the rundown of the coal and steel industry in Wales.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to get involved in a historical discussion of the structural changes in the coal or steel industry during a debate on the Budget and its implications for Wales.

Funds came from Europe to restructure the communities that were affected by the rundown of the mining industry and by the changes in the steel industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be the last intervention that I can take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon.

Does he agree that the present Government need to settle that additionality, which his Government unfortunately did not settle, contingent on the Welsh block grant settlement? Will he support me on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government asked for it, I would provide any assistance that I could with their problems with additionality. The Government are apparently committed to helping Wales, and the Prime Minister has said that he will not let Wales down, yet there is not a penny on the table towards the £1.2 billion that I mentioned. I cited Rover because it is a current topic, and because it is clear that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may have been aware of BMW's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of that situation are now being felt by car workers not only in the midlands but in Wales. We heard the figures quoted earlier. Krupp Camford Pressings intends to shed 450 jobs. Calsonic Radiators in Llanelli needs voluntary redundancies among its workforce of 1,100, and 40 per cent. of that firm's output goes to Rover. There is uncertainty in the Welsh business community—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. The previous Front-Bench Conservative spokesman for Wales, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), made some cutting comments on Labour attendance at the debate. He has since left the debate, taking his notes with him, and has not had the courtesy even to listen to his colleague. Is that in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not for me to answer. I know where my hon. Friend is, however. He is taking part in a discussion with Members of the Welsh Assembly, and I have no doubt that he will bring their good wishes to the Committee when he speaks this afternoon. I was fully aware that he would not be present if I happened to be speaking now. However, I am grateful to you for calling me at this point in the debate, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will continue on the uncertainty in the business community in Wales, because I think that it should be cleared up. I hope that in his reply the Secretary of State will tell us what he is seeking to negotiate from the Chief Secretary in terms of match funding. It is quite clear from the answers that the Secretary of State has given me and other right hon. and hon. Members over the last few months that we will not hear anything from the Government about the level of match funding that will be made available to Wales under objective 1 before the comprehensive spending review this summer. Will the Secretary of State or his colleague tell us what he will negotiate from the Chief Secretary in that review? It is now clear that nothing will be forthcoming from the Treasury in year 1—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be able to answer that question later as I shall not be winding up. When during the 18 years of Conservative Government did negotiations with the Chief Secretary about the spending review take place in public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his intervention. What I seek from him, however, is some indication of the needs as he perceives them and the timetable that he will present to the Chief Secretary. I am not asking for his negotiations with the Chief Secretary to be conducted in public, but it must surely be clear from the presentations that have been made by the National Assembly and from the programme of objective 1 funding what the needs are. If we are to have nothing in years 1 and 2 from the Treasury, what will we get in years 3 to 7? How will the money be spread? It is clear that if businesses and other sectors of the Welsh economy are to participate in this structural fund programme, they will want some clear indication first, that the money will be available and secondly, of what the timing for those flows of money will be. We want to know not about the timing of the commitments, but about the timing of the money being made available by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know when Wales will benefit. I obviously take the point that the Secretary of State will not be winding up the debate but I assume that his colleague, the Under-Secretary will contribute. I hope that he can tell us about the timing of those payments. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
have already had a written answer and an exchange with the Secretary of State. I hope that he can give us some indication about the departmental expenditure limit of the Wales Office. Will it be extended to take account of the objective 1 moneys that will come from the Treasury or will that spending be at the expense of other programmes in Wales so that the National Assembly can remain within the departmental expenditure limit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How confident is the Under-Secretary that, over the latter five years of the objective 1 programme, every penny of the £1.2 billion of match funding will be paid to the National Assembly for this programme? He may not be totally confident, but as other speakers have pointed out, we may have a Conservative Government by then and it will be their problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with two matters about which the Budget was deficient and on which the Secretary of State's speech gave me cause for concern. Although reference has been made to last week's farming summit, I refer to the lack of a commitment in the Budget to some of the problems of rural Wales. The Chancellor was silent on the crisis in farming and he gave no respite to the poor old rural motorist, who has to travel thousands of miles every year because public transport does not exist in many parts of Wales. The motor car is the only means to go to work, take children to school, go shopping or go on any sort of journey in vast areas of rural Wales. The Government have done absolutely nothing to improve the lot of the rural motorist. Rural Wales has been neglected in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with his colleague, the leader of the Conservative party in the Assembly, that money should be transferred from education and health to compensate landowners for the consequences of the right-to-roam provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to discuss a devolved matter. I expect that the Secretary of State would give a similar answer if he were asked that question. The distribution of the budget in Wales is a matter for the National Assembly. If it wished to pay such compensation at the expense of education or health, it could decide to do so. However, I would not necessarily think that such a decision would be right if, as he suggests, it were taken at the expense of health and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to the effects of the Budget on his constituents. I wonder whether he was talking about the pensioners in his constituency. They may benefit from the increase in the basic old-age pension and other measures, such as fuel payments and TV licences for the over-75s, but he surely realises that even pensioners must pay council tax. The council tax in his constituency has increased by 10.6 per cent. In Monmouthshire, which neighbours his constituency, the increase will be 24 per cent.—approximately 10 times the rate of inflation. The council tax payers of Torfaen or Monmouthshire will not think that the Government have reduced the tax burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Clearly, the Government have increased the tax burden on ordinary taxpayers. Mortgage interest relief at source and the married couples allowance have been abolished this year, and duties on various commodities have been increased. The overall burden of taxation as a percentage of GDP has increased from 35.3 to 37.4 per cent. this year. It has not been a good Budget for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) was strong on criticism but weak on commitment. He did not seem to know his party's policy on anything. He could not offer any prospect of a future Conservative Government in Wales, although I am certain that such a Government would not prioritise spending on the health service. If I may reminisce for a moment, I was a member of the only royal commission on the national health service ever to be set up. Unfortunately, it reported when a Conservative Government came into office in 1979. The report, which we had spent three years preparing, landed on the desk of an incoming Conservative Prime Minister. Royal commission reports usually gather dust, but we were convinced, in 1977, that that would not happen if it landed on the desk of a Labour Prime Minister. However, it was put on the shelf, and it did gather dust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report made the point that the NHS was good value for money but grossly underfunded. The incoming Conservative Government ignored that point. Twenty-one years later, we have a Government who have taken note of that recommendation. I welcome what the Chancellor of the Exchequer did in the Budget, which showed that the Government are totally committed to the national health service, especially in Wales, where so many people, such as Nye Bevan, his sister Arianwen Bevan-Norris and Archie Lush—one of his close friends—helped to set it up. I am therefore especially proud that it is a new Labour Government who have made certain that that service begins to get the funding that it needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to her membership of a royal commission on the health service. Perhaps I may remind her that there has been a royal commission on health service matters under this Government—the royal commission on the long-term care of the elderly—whose recommendations the Government have rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point, which the hon. Gentleman clearly missed, is that it was the only royal commission on the national health service as a whole and that the Conservative Government ignored its findings. The best that he could say was that he would not want to question extra spending on health, which is damning by faint praise. He could have been a little more enthusiastic, and could have said what a Conservative Government's plans would be for funding the NHS, especially in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a shopping list for my constituency. I have been its Member of Parliament for 16 years, and have witnessed the gross underfunding of the health service in the south Wales valleys. I do not want to downplay
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
the needs of north Wales, where I come from. I recognise the importance of British Aerospace for jobs in that area. Many people that I knew worked in that industry, for which you, Mr. Jones, have been a strong advocate. While I have an argument with British Aerospace in terms of arms exports to countries with bad human rights records, that is another matter, which I shall not go into today. I recognise the needs of north Wales as well as those of south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pressing need exists for the modernisation of health care services in the Cynon valley, as in all the valleys of south Wales. There are many single-handed general practitioners, a fact to which we drew attention in 1979, when we recommended that they should be phased out. Many of them are due to retire in the next five years. I should like to know what plans are in hand. I accept that my right hon. and hon. Friends will not be able to answer some of my questions, but I hope that they put them with considerable vigour to the Welsh Assembly. We want the residents of the Cynon valley to have access to high-quality family care in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that the royal commission examined in 1979 was the under-doctored areas, not only of Wales, but the rest of United Kingdom. We examined health care in other countries, too, such as that in the United States of America, and what happened in North Carolina, which had under-doctored areas. It never ceases to amaze me that we have a University Hospital of Wales, which produces a considerable number of doctors each year, yet they never want to practice in the valleys of south Wales where some of the biggest challenges to provide the health care needed by people in the valleys lie. In North Carolina, the services directed doctors into under-doctored areas for two or three years after they were first trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not have a GP service in the Cynon valley were it not for the considerable number of Asian-trained doctors who practise in that area. When the state funds the training of doctors over a long period, we have a right to expect them to go where the needs are greatest—if only for two or three years. Many buildings in the Cynon valley are old and in a poor state of repair and it is essential that facilities are developed that are conducive to the provision of high-quality modern health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be public involvement in decisions that concern health. Some years ago, I took part in a consultation process on healthy choices at which vast numbers of people turned up to discuss what sort of health service they wanted in their areas. A document was produced as a result of that, but many of its promises have still not been realised. It is important that the public are involved in the formative stages of the planning process of improved health care. What plans do the Government have in that regard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time before the Welsh Assembly was set up I highlighted the problem of dealing with mental health. A day care facility will soon be opened in my constituency, but there is still a need for mental health rehabilitation beds for the residents in the Cynon valley and for much strengthened community mental health services. North Glamorgan NHS trust has submitted a business case in support of the above services and
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
mental health is a priority outlined in the draft pathfinder health improvement programme for 2000 to 2005 that was developed by the Bro Taf health authority. Will investment be available for those developments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for health visitors and school nurses, a large deficit exists in such services. There is no school nursing service and there is a shortage of health visitors to deal with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Given that tackling inequalities in health is an important priority nationally and locally, I should like to know what is being done to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to the funding formula. I am almost boring myself rigid by referring to it yet again because it has been debated many times here and elsewhere. But if we are to tackle inequalities in health and bring the health of the worst up to that of the best, it is essential that the funding formula is changed to allow the investment in resources in our most deprived areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much progress has been made in England in such matters and it is now part of the formula in determining the allocation of health resources. A lot of progress has also been made in Scotland on reviewing the funding formula in order to take account of deprivation and so on, but we have been pretty slow in Wales. If people's health is to improve, the Government must target those areas most in need. They must take into account Welsh social and economic factors as determinants of health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall run through some of the key pointers. A higher percentage of people in Wales is suffering from limiting long-term illness than in the UK as a whole. Wales has a higher percentage of disabled people than anywhere else in the UK. The majority of health authorities suffering from the worst health position in the UK are in the Welsh valleys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, health in Wales is worse than in England. However, health in many parts of west Wales and the valleys is substantially worse than in the rest of Wales. Some of those communities have a life expectancy at least five years lower than that of the more advantaged parts of Wales and had an excess premature mortality rate rolling from 48 per cent. to 69 per cent. in the decade 1981–91. Those are shocking figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula used for funding health authorities in England is a weighted capitation formula. English health authorities are funded on the basis of their populations, weighted by their need for services. That need is determined by a range of social and economic factors, some of which come under the umbrella term of deprivation. They include unemployment levels, levels of long-term illness, the number of pensioners living alone, the number of lone-parent households, ethnic origin and standardised mortality rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula used for Wales is also a weighted capitation formula. In contrast with the English model, it is based largely on standardised mortality rates and the age structure of the Welsh health authorities' populations. It takes deprivation and social and economic factors into account, but does not do so to the same extent as the English or Scottish models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
When the Welsh health authorities' resource allocation group reported a couple of years ago, it recommended the adoption of a modified English model, which took into account some of the factors that I have mentioned and added a rural cost premium on community health services and ambulance service expenditure to take account of rural sparsity. As a result of adopting that modified English model, Bro Taf, for example, would gain about £5.9 million, a considerable increase on its present allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party recommended that the Welsh Office and NHS representatives examine how its recommendations could best be implemented. The Welsh Office concluded that it was an unsuitable time to change the funding formula for Wales. In other words, the issue was ducked. It should not have been, as it was right to change the formula then, and it is right to change it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly has been considering the matter, and my right hon. Friend has told me that discussions are progressing. Since the working party's report, Sir John Arbutnott's report "Fair Shares for All: The Report of the National Review of Resource Allocation in NHS in Scotland" has been published. It is high time that the formula was introduced in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no more equivocation. Implementing the formula may be politically difficult, as some parts of Wales may lose out as a result of the fairer allocation. However, with the extra boost to the NHS in Wales, I hope that resource allocation will be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already spoken about the higher mortality rates, resulting from poor health, in some parts of Wales. Hon. Members who represent such areas will no longer be content to sit back—for political or other reasons—when the people whom we represent are getting a worse health service than they should because resources are not properly allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the great boost to the health service. I have long been involved in the health service in Wales: I have been a member of a Welsh hospital board, of a community health council and even of a royal commission and it grieves me to see so many people in the Welsh valleys still being so under-resourced notwithstanding their pressing and great needs. It can mean the difference between life and death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new arrangements involve: an inclusive process of formulating a council's policy framework and budget, which will be the responsibility of the full council in public; publicly known individuals—the executive—being personally responsible for implementing this framework and budget; accurate recording of decisions and their reasons, and timely publication of these and of the background and factual papers available to the decision maker(s); and powerful overview and scrutiny committees meeting in public to discuss and make recommendations on the development of policies, and to hold each executive member to account for want he or she has done and is planning to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
