	<div class='title'>Comprehensive Spending Review</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the implications of the comprehensive spending review for the Welsh block grant. [125645]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the Chancellor regularly and discuss a variety of issues, including this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reply. Will the Secretary of State now acknowledge that the Treasury is apparently reluctant to consider increasing the Welsh block to allow extra funding for objective 1? Will he admit that, as things stand, Wales is unlikely to get any match funds to enable us to benefit fully from objective 1 in European funding? What further pressure can he put on the Chancellor to ensure that we do not lose out on this occasion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman has made about structural funding. He will realise that that is part of the spending review. He does not have long to wait before that review is announced in a few weeks' time. We cannot say how much will be available until it has been announced. He can rest assured that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), the First Secretary and I are addressing the issue with enormous robustness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Health Resources</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has had with elected members of the Welsh Assembly on using deprivation as a factor in allocating health resources in Wales. [125647]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have both highlighted the importance of taking account of the health needs of socio-economic disadvantaged areas when allocating health resources. I understand that the National Assembly for Wales has included that as part of the terms of reference of the group that it has set up to review the current arrangements for the allocation of financial resources to the national health service in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I have been asking this question for at least two years. Parts of Wales, such as the area that I represent in the Cynon valley, suffer from acute deprivation. Unless that is reflected in the allocation of health resources, the welcome increase in the health budget may be dissipated throughout Wales rather than focused on those areas that are in greatest need. When will the Welsh Assembly get on with the job of tackling deprivation as part of the formula for allocating resources? I do not want to be asking the same question in two years' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The National Assembly is very concerned about the factors that my hon. Friend has mentioned. That is another reason why my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has allocated considerable additional resources of £1.3 billion to the NHS in Wales. The National Assembly's task force includes cross-party membership of the Assembly and the NHS. It is due to issue a preliminary report at the end of this year and a final report by March 2001. The comprehensive spending review that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned will be a major factor in helping to bring that report to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister acknowledge that heart disease is probably worse in percentage terms in Wales than anywhere else in the United Kingdom, and that this is linked to deprivation? The Cynon Valley constituency has a high rate of heart disease. Will he please ensure that deprivation is given due priority because it is one of the key issues relating to heart disease?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that not just heart disease, but many other illnesses are the result of poverty, deprivation and the factors that both he and my hon. Friend have highlighted. The Government are committed to tackling long-term illness and long-term structural problems in areas such as the valleys, and that is why we support the Assembly's efforts to look into deprivation, and why we are allocating considerable additional resources to the NHS in the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Health Funding</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the First Secretary on the additional funding for health in Wales announced in the last Budget. [125648]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have spoken to the First Secretary and the Assembly Health Secretary about the increase to the Welsh block consequential on the increases in Government spending on health announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in the last Budget. The resulting amount for the block was £1,299 million over the next four years. I am pleased to say that the National Assembly intends to spend the full amount on health in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend confirm that there will be £110 million in this financial year for the NHS in Wales, £153 million next year, £394 million the year after and £649 million the year after that, and that those sums are extra resources over and above what would have been spent? Does he agree that that massive sustained investment represents a clear commitment to restoring NHS funding to the level that it should be in relation to the European Union average?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The total for the four years is £1,299 million. My hon. Friend's figures are roughly correct. The figure for this year is £99 million. The £1.3 billion will be a tremendous boost over and above what the Government pledged to give the NHS. It is more money than any Government have given previously over such a period, and it will have practical effects on waiting lists, operations and deprivation. That would not have happened with either the nationalists or the Conservatives in control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the Conservatives been in control, the money that has been allocated to the health service would not have been diverted to spending on preparations for the changeover plan for the euro. Following the revelations in the 	<i>Sunday Telegraph,</i> which stated that millions of pounds are now being spend on the NHS for the changeover plan, could the Minister tell us how much money has been allocated specifically to the NHS in Wales to spend on the changeover plan and how much money the NHS has spent on that already?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's obsession with Europe shows no bounds. We are discussing real health issues and real people. I cannot give him a figure. He could not expect me to have it to hand. I shall look into the issue that he raises, but I would be more interested in examining his tax plans. His party is not committed to the NHS and does not support the allocation of that £1.3 billion. The Conservatives should get their act together, because at the end of the day this is real money for real people in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Public Inquiries</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on (a) the powers and (b) the budget his Department has for holding public inquiries in Wales. [125649]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Powers to hold public inquiries were transferred from the Secretary of State for Wales to the National Assembly for Wales on 1 July 1999. However, the power to hold a tribunal of inquiry, subject to Parliament's approval under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, was not transferred to the Assembly. I retained responsibility for the completion of the report of the north Wales child abuse tribunal, and held the budget for it, but I have no other budget to hold public inquiries in Wales; nor do I have any proposals to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be aware of the issue that has arisen in the National Assembly about a public inquiry. Is he aware of the controversy about the powers to have a full public inquiry in that or other contexts? If some of the powers are being transferred, but some, including those for tribunals, are being retained by the Secretary of State in London, can he give an assurance that if a matter arises that needs a public inquiry, he has a mechanism to get the additional resources that may be required to pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generally speaking—although I would not like to say this is always the case—in the example that the right hon. Gentleman gave the matter would not be transferred to the Assembly anyway. It would be exceptional for inquiries to be held—as was the north Wales child abuse inquiry—as a result of my office's intervention. If there were such inquiries, they would be of such enormous significance—as with the north Wales inquiry—that only the Government, under the 1921 Act, would hold them. As I said, I hold no money for public inquiries in Wales, nor do I have any proposal to do so. Obviously, if the legal situation is clear, the Government will consider the matter. However, most inquiries—I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman agrees with this—are now a matter for the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>National Health Service (Modernisation)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee at 10 Downing street on 5 June to discuss modernisation of the national health service. [125650]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All three JMC meetings held so far have proved very useful, and have been an ideal forum for exchanging innovative ideas and best practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did those meetings include any discussion on the pre-negotiation of consultants' contracts? Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a serious conflict of interest problem with part-time consultants in the national health service, especially orthopaedic surgeons who perform hip and knee replacements. A minority of consultants are deliberately using long waiting lists as a means of feeding their private practices. The NHS needs only full-time consultants, which means that we must pay them more, so that they have 100 per cent. commitment to the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of issues have been raised in the meetings held so far, although the detailed matter to which my hon. Friend refers was not discussed. However, as he will know, a national plan for health will be announced later, probably in July. I assume that the National Assembly will make its own proposals and statements on the health service at about the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of the meetings that have taken place is to consider best practice in each of the different parts of the United Kingdom. For example, Northern Ireland has shown us how social services and health
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
authorities work together. There, those services are exactly the same, but they are separate in other places. In Wales, we have a good story to tell about telemedicine. That example was relayed to people from Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. In Scotland, extra work is done on prevention. The meetings allow us to share experiences and look to the future. I am sure that the point my hon. Friend made about consultants will be addressed when the national plan emerges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Joint Ministerial Committee is a crucial body in a devolved regime, if we are to have a co-ordinated approach to the challenges that face the health service across the United Kingdom? Does he accept that public expectation, not only in England but in Wales, is that there should be a robust approach and a convergence of policy between Wales and England on important issues such as the need to tackle restrictive practices, to take consultants out of the driving seat and to respond genuinely to patients' needs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Ministerial Committee is interesting, because we have shared experiences differently since devolution. I rather suspect that those in the Welsh health service, whether political managers or civil servants, did not have the same access before devolution to information about practices in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. It is an irony that devolution has meant a greater bringing together of minds to tackle exactly the same problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also struck by the fact that we all share the problems that we face, particularly in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as a result of the economic and social difficulties that those three countries have suffered over the past few years with the decline of industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware of the recent claim that there were 500 deaths in Welsh hospitals from hospital-acquired infections—methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus—but only 30 in the Netherlands, a land with many times the population of Wales? One explanation is its higher standards of cleanliness and hygiene in hospitals. Will my right hon. Friend take steps to ensure that the Government rather than the opportunist Opposition lead the crusade to bring back the matron?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's concerns on that matter and I gladly leave matron to the National Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the First Secretary on promoting credit unions in Wales. [125651]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the First Secretary regularly to discuss a wide range of issues. We are both aware of the important contribution that credit unions can make in tackling disadvantage and promoting economic growth in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Wales. I understand that the Assembly is currently developing proposals to promote credit unions on an all-Wales basis, using "Pathway to Prosperity" funds in conjunction with European grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear about the steps that the National Assembly is taking to promote credit unions in Wales. I helped to establish one of the most successful such unions in Wales—the Clwyd coastal credit union, which won an HTV prize for the training of 28 members before it was established—and I am acutely aware of the problems that it faces. I urge my right hon. Friend to pursue this matter not only with the National Assembly, but with the Treasury and to consider rate relief for credit unions' buildings, television advertising and funding through special grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly recognise the value of credit unions in giving people on low incomes access to capital. I congratulate my hon. Friend on his work over the years on credit unions in north Wales. I note an expansion of the same system in the south Wales valleys, for example. The Assembly takes this matter extremely seriously and I give my hon. Friend an assurance that I shall raise the matter with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) in highlighting the hidden success of credit unions and I strongly support the initiatives of the National Assembly to promote them in Wales. In common with my hon. Friend, I emphasise the importance of securing the right environment for credit unions and mutuality across the United Kingdom. We are living in period when mutuality and the past successes of building societies are under threat and the credit union movement is, in a sense, a reinvention of that sort of support to help take people out of poverty—one of the strengths of our communities in the past. I reinforce the plea to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that the right climate is created throughout Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give my right hon. Friend that assurance. As the former First Secretary as well as Member of Parliament for Cardiff, South and Penarth, my right hon. Friend takes a keen interest in the development of credit unions. I also know of his background in the co-operative movement. He understands the importance of moving people out of poverty in Wales. It is significant that we are discussing credit unions in a Welsh Grand Committee debate on social exclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the community university of North Wales, which was successfully launched on 25 May this year? It is an important step forward in the Government's programme of lifelong learning and it is the largest alliance of its kind in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is a partnership of 10 educational establishments—eight further education and two higher education. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is an important step forward in providing the people of north Wales with something that was denied to them for many years? Will he take every opportunity to promote this establishment whenever he meets people in Wales and in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly welcome the establishment of the community university in north Wales. Indeed, I took the opportunity earlier this year to meet the Vice Chancellor and pro-Vice Chancellor of Bangor university to discuss the establishment of the community university as an important means of helping to develop higher and further education throughout north Wales. I particularly welcome the fact that Northop horticultural college in the good constituency of Delyn is one of the partners in the community university. I also welcome my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have regular discussions about employment matters with Ministers in the Department for Education and Employment. The Government's aim is to reconnect people with the labour market so that they can play a full and productive part in society. At the end of February this year, more than 27,100 young people had entered the new deal programme in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's response. Does he agree that one of the Government's greatest successes is to have put so many young people into work? That is particularly important when many of us have seen the impact over the previous 20 years of young people being abandoned and having no hope for the future. Does my hon. Friend agree that we must ensure that the Government's programme continues to develop and reaches all parts of Wales—particularly in inner cities, the valleys and rural areas in which employment opportunities are most difficult to come by?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes some important points about the new deal. Some 28,000 young people have entered the new deal since its
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
establishment and there are currently 8,000 people on the new deal in Wales—in cities, rural areas and the valleys. Since the Government came to power, the new deal has encouraged a 61 per cent. fall in the number of 18 to 24-year-olds who are unemployed. I do not want to be too party political, but the Conservative party, represented here today by the hon. Members for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), would have voted against and scrapped the new deal. If there were another Conservative Government, they would not be committed to any sort of new deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Jobs there have been lost to a company in Brazil, not because of quality, but because people in Brazil are willing to work for a bowl of rice.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a lot of talk about Welsh residents waiting for their first out-patient appointments.

	<br><blockquote><p>we hope to have the opportunity before long to do the job properly. That will be done when we revisit the question of the Welsh language measure, when we are in Government.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15 July 1993; Vol. 228, c. 1212.]</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first Welsh language Act was a proper Act for Wales. There is no statutory declaration of the official status of English in the United Kingdom. The Welsh Language Act 1993 established the basis of bilingualism in Wales, as far as it could. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is to consider how people in Wales embrace the Welsh language, especially in those parts of Wales, such as my own, that are English speaking. I am pleased that in the past few months there has been a tremendous expansion in Welsh-medium education in primary and comprehensive schools in my constituency. When people in English-speaking areas and those in Welsh-speaking areas who speak English see the benefits of learning Welsh, there will be a solution to the problems that have beset the Welsh language in the past few decades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that reply.

	<div class='title'>Social Exclusion in Wales</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Darling)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In line with the usual conventions of the House, I arranged for copies of my statement to be sent to the principal Opposition spokesmen. Copies left my office at 9.30 am, but for some reason did not arrive until about 15 minutes ago, for which I apologise. However, I am sure that Opposition spokesmen will be able to follow what I have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make a short statement on what the Government are doing to tackle poverty and social exclusion throughout the country and in Wales. We are working closely with the National Assembly for Wales, and both Administrations are working together to tackle poverty and exclusion. The United Kingdom Government's strategy was set out in the report "Opportunity for All", which I published last September. It states the problems that we face and the measures we are taking to alleviate poverty and to tackle its root causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Assembly has shown its commitment to tackling social disadvantage in Wales. In January, the First Secretary published "A Better Wales", a 10-year plan to improve life for everyone in Wales. Poverty and social exclusion are endemic problems that build up over generations, but that has been especially so in the past 20 years. We want to build a country in which everyone has the opportunity to get on. A key way to combat poverty is to get people into work, because lack of work is the main cause of poverty, especially child poverty. The number of children growing up in workless households doubled between 1979 and 1997. That is why there is so much persistent poverty, especially among children. That is not just economic madness; it is morally wrong. No child should grow up without the chance to get on. We are determined to halve child poverty within 10 years and to end it within a generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are already making progress; there are 900,000 more people in work now than there were in 1997—31,000 in Wales. By getting more people into work and making work pay, we are helping to break the no-pay, low-pay cycle that has blighted too many people's lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Carry on, Mr. Darling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer questions later. No doubt the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) will acquaint himself with the Committee's procedures in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our strategy goes much wider because it tackles the many factors that cause social exclusion: unemployment, inadequate housing, high crime rates and the lack of access to good quality public services, such as health care and a decent education. We are systematically tackling problems faced by children, people of working age and older people, and are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
working to close the gap between the most deprived areas and other communities. For example, 3,000 people aged 25 or over who have been unemployed for 18 months or more will benefit from the employment zones established in north-west Wales and in the heads of the valleys and Caerphilly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that we work together, because the National Assembly has responsibility for many policies vital to tackling social exclusion. We are working in partnership with the Assembly and local agencies to build a more inclusive society. The Joint Ministerial Committee met in Edinburgh on 26 May and agreed to work with councils to encourage take-up of the benefits and services available to pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making significant progress towards our goal of ending child poverty in 20 years, as the UNICEF report published last week recognised. By the end of this Parliament, more than 1 million children will have been lifted out of poverty. We are getting parents into work and increasing benefits to help them to meet the costs of bringing up children. In April, the rate of child benefit increased to £15 a week for a first child and £10 for subsequent children. That rate will increase again next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working families tax credit guarantees a minimum income of £214 a week for families with children and someone in full-time work. In total, we have increased the money paid for children of parents who cannot work by £14 a week since 1997. Together, all those measures will lift about 50,000 children in Wales out of poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, action to tackle poverty must range wider than simply raising incomes. It must involve increasing opportunity through better skills and qualifications. From next year, total spending on school education will be at an all-time high in real terms. We are working with the National Assembly to provide children with an educational and skills base better matched to the modern labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If real progress is to be made, we must make a difference even earlier in children's lives, so £25 million is being invested in Wales in sure start schemes. Programmes are operating in all 22 local authority areas in Wales to give children under three a better healthier start and encourage the educational and social development necessary to enable them to succeed at school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national child care strategy will increase the provision of good quality child care and encourage early-years development. In Wales, almost £5 million has already been made available. The National Assembly is spending a further £2.3 million this year on developing child care provision, for example, through local partnerships. All those measures will give children in Wales the opportunity for a better start in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By lifting 50,000 children out of poverty, we will reduce child poverty in Wales by about a quarter by 2001. However, tackling the poverty of children means
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
improving their parents' incomes and extending their options. Between 1979 and 1996–97, the proportion of the population in workless households doubled. Although unemployment is falling, more than 20 per cent. of working-age households in Wales are without work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced changes to help people into work and make work pay. More than 100,000 employees in Wales are entitled to higher pay as a result of the national minimum wage. On average, that raised the incomes of those benefiting by 30 per cent. The 10p starting rate of tax and tax credits further improve the incomes of people on low wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are beginning to see results. Since 1997, employment in Wales has increased by 31,000. More than 14,000 young people—more than half of those participating—have found jobs through the new deal. The latest labour force survey figures show that there are about 13 people of working age in employment for each unemployed person. However, we must do more. The new working age agency will provide more practical help to enable those who can work to get work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To complement those improvements, the National Assembly is committed to taking action to tackle wider aspects of social exclusion. Its "Better Wales" document sets out its aim to reduce gaps in health and to improve housing, the environment and job prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined to tackle pensioner poverty for the future. We are restructuring pensions so that the 18 million workers who are low paid, disabled or carers will do better. Just under 1 million of those people are in Wales. We are helping people to provide for a retirement to which they can look forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also tackling pensioner poverty now. The minimum income guarantee sets a baseline for the incomes of the poorest and will help more than 90,000 pensioner households in Wales. In addition, last year more than 550,000 pensioner households in Wales gained from the winter fuel payments. This winter, those payments will increase to £150 and will be extended to all households with someone over 60. Together, the winter fuel payments, the changes to value added tax on fuel, the minimum income guarantee and the free television licences mean that the oldest poorest pensioners will gain more than £10 a week in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that we are also working to improve the most deprived communities, for example, by establishing the new deal for communities, and employment and health action zones. That is complemented by the National Assembly's "Communities First" document, which sets out a new approach to long-term regeneration in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 20 years, social security spending has doubled, yet the number of children in poverty has trebled. More people have been out of work for longer. Inequality in pensioner incomes is as wide now as it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
was 40 years ago. That is what we inherited. Those are the problems that we are determined to tackle. We have made a start, but there is much more to do. We are determined to combat the poverty of opportunity and expectation, as well as the poverty of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the statement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee always welcomes members of the Government. I do not want to be ungrateful or ungracious in responding, but I must ask what was the point of the statement. It announced nothing new. A statement should supply new information. To use the Committee to do nothing but repeat information that we already know is an abuse. The statement was no more than a public relations exercise before a general election, and I hope that the Secretary of State concedes that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to children in need, but not to the progress being made, or not being made, on the children's commissioner. Can he confirm that the children's commissioner will have statutory powers to deal with all children at risk, not just those within the restricted scope of the Care Standards Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the amount of money available for housing in Wales, particularly through local authorities, has been repeatedly cut in the past five years? That has caused lengthening queues for renovation grants. When will new legislation be introduced to establish a new and imaginative housing repair system that meets needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State claimed that 50,000 children in Wales would be raised out of poverty. How was that figure calculated? The process was far from clear from his statement. He will know from the question about the national child care strategy that I asked in the House yesterday that the Chwarae Teg organisation is far from happy with the way in which money is clawed back. People who received money for child care lost their housing benefit and were no better off. Will he link up with Chwarae Teg in Cardiff to ensure that the system works properly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State did not refer to the vexed question of rural poverty, the response to which the Minister for the Cabinet Office is supposed to co-ordinate. In the House last week, she said that she was having difficulties in co-ordinating with the National Assembly for Wales. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of that? Will he link up with her to overcome those difficulties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that breaking the link between pensions and earnings cost single pensioners £30 a week? If it had not happened, a single pensioner would now receive £97 a week. Making available a system similar to income support is not good enough to help pensioners with a modest income in addition to the state pension. They are losing out severely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State ensure that all disabled people receive the winter fuel payment? The disability living allowance system is not working, but he made no
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
comment about that or about the withdrawal of DLA from people to whom it had been awarded for life. That is hitting hundreds of people in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful for a reply, rather than more propaganda, on the problems facing Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As this is the Secretary of State's first visit to the Committee, I should inform him that the right hon. Gentleman has just formally welcomed him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some experience of Grand Committees, having attended the Scottish one for many years, so I knew that the right hon. Gentleman was warmly welcoming me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is well aware that social security is reserved to Westminster and that the rules apply across the country, so that if I were about to make a major policy change, the correct place to do it would be on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee. This is an opportunity to question me and I shall answer all the questions that he put. It is no doubt an opportunity for my colleagues to ask the Welsh nationalists why they voted against every uprating measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a long debate ahead and my hon. Friends will no doubt wish to go over that matter. Many people will be interested to see why the nationalists and the Liberal Democrats voted against uprating—every single item of it. So far as the children are concerned and the report following the scandal in the care homes, my right hon. Friend is considering the role of the children's commissioner and whether that needs to be underpinned. He will address the Committee shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On housing and housing benefit, it is interesting that because of the working families tax credit—which the Conservatives have announced they would abolish—one in eight people rely on housing benefit. It used to be one in three under family credit, which shows the increase in income the working families tax credit provided. However, we are making changes. The next change, due to take place on 3 July, will help with the problem to which the hon. Gentleman refers. We want everyone who goes to work to be better off and not to lose out because of the interaction between child care costs and housing benefit costs. We are dealing with that, as I told the hon. Gentleman yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rural poverty, poverty matters to us whether it is urban or rural. The hon. Gentleman is quite right: there is a lot of rural poverty and our initiatives, particularly those helping people to get back into work, address this problem, together with transport and other issues. The hon. Gentleman mentions pensions. I remind him and the Committee that we inherited a situation where the gap between the better-off pensioners and the poorest pensioners had never been greater. It is as wide now as it was 40 years ago. The problem that we inherited is that pensioners in the top 20 per cent. of pensioner income saw their incomes go up by 80 per cent. in the last 20 years, whereas the bottom 20 per cent. saw their incomes go up by 30 per cent. An across the board increase would have meant giving exactly the same to the poorest and to the better off, except that the poorest would lose it through pension clawback because of the way the benefit

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
system works. That is why we introduced the minimum income guarantee, which gives £8 to £10 a week over inflation to pensioners who qualify. He is, however, absolutely right to say that the next problem we need to address is that faced by pensioners with modest incomes and modest capital. That is what the pensioner credit is designed to address and we will consult on that.

The last thing that the hon. Gentleman asked me about was the disability living allowance. The previous Government introduced legislation that referred to life awards. That was a misnomer as they were nothing of the sort. The awards have always been reviewable if the circumstances change, and we have changed the law to clarify that. We inherited problems with the administration of the disability living allowance and we are in the process of sorting them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement. Does he agree that having a strategy to combat poverty for the next 20 years exposes the lack of any strategy to combat poverty in the last 20 years? Does he also agree that many people in Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom find the benefit system complicated, and need help and advice on how to access benefits, and that citizens advice bureaux do a tremendous job in supporting people? What consideration has my right hon. Friend given to allowing social security resources to go into supporting voluntary organisations like the CAB, in order to provide an effective welfare rights service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that latter point, my hon. Friend will be aware that there are a number of initiatives throughout the country, and particularly one in Wales, in which social security staff are trying to work more closely with organisations like the CAB and with local authorities to make sure that people get the money to which they are entitled. The new working age agency, which the Government announced earlier this year and which will come into operation next year, will see a step change in the help given. Not only will we tell people how best to get back into work, but we will advise them as to how much money they are entitled to.

On the hon. Gentleman's point on poverty, he is absolutely right. It is a scandal that this is one of the most prosperous countries in the world and yet we have so much poverty. Last week's UNICEF report drew attention to that. I was interested to note that the hon. Gentleman who speaks for the Tories on social security, the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)—who does not sit on this Grand Committee—said how scandalous it was. It is just a shame that he had not noticed that they were 1995 figures, as his party was in government at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome. As I was asked to be brief, may I refer him to the statement that I have just delivered, which set out what the Government are doing. We want to get more people into work because work is the best route out of poverty. We want to eradicate child poverty in Wales and everywhere else in the United Kingdom. We want to deal with pensioner poverty and to ensure that pensioners have a secure income in the future. We also want to ensure that we provide security for all those who cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a rounded strategy. We are working with the National Assembly, and I believe that, not just at the end of this Parliament but in each succeeding year, people will see that the Labour Government have made a very real difference to the lives of people in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the many positive initiatives the Government have introduced to combat pensioner poverty. Can the Minister inform me whether he could live on the basic state pension or the minimum income guarantee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his welcome for what the Government have done. Our objective is to make sure that pensioners can retire on as high an income as possible. He asked me about the basic state pension. Right from its start, it was anticipated that the basic state pension would be a foundation and that people should have built up a second pension to go with it. The problem is that too many people did not do that. Average pensioner income in this country is £132, not £67.50, because many people—unfortunately, not all—built up second pensions to go with the basic state pension. Our objective is to make sure that people have a decent pension when they come to retire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of members of the Committee will be disappointed that the Secretary of State made no mention of social exclusion in our rural communities. Nor did he mention rural transport and the lack of bus services, or, more particularly, the increase in petrol prices for those who have to use the motor car. He did not mention threats to village schools and pubs and, most particularly, to village post office. His Department has been labelled as responsible for the massive loss that the Post Office announced yesterday because it ceased to support Post Office computerisation. Has the Department made any assessment of the number of post office closures in Wales that will result from the change in benefit payments to automated credit transfer? Can he give a guarantee to this Committee that no rural post office in Wales will close as a result of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I thank the hon. Gentleman for his welcome. As I do not think that Dorset is in Wales, perhaps we should welcome him here as well. Let me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
deal with his four points. I have to admire either his sense of humour or his brass neck. When the Conservatives deregulated bus services in 1995, they decimated rural bus services. Bus services all over the country simply stopped as a result of what the Tories did. The difference today is that we are trying to rebuild bus services through the efforts being made by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. We are investing more in bus services to try to improve transport infrastructure throughout the country—something the Tories never did. The hon. Gentleman asked about petrol prices. Who was it who introduced the fuel escalator? Who tried to tell us that that was an environmental measure? It was the now noble Lord Lamont. The hon. Gentleman asked about post offices, and I must tell him that they were closing at the rate of about 200 to 300 a year throughout the years when the Tories were in office, and they did nothing about it then. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will make a statement in the House shortly showing how the Government intend to maintain their support of the post office network. The Tories wanted to privatise it, which would have resulted in wholesale closures. We believe that we should support an important part of the network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Post Office loss announced yesterday. That was, indeed, a one-off loss following cancellation of the benefit payment card, which was yet another bungled computerisation project left to us by the Conservative party. The hon. Gentleman might ask himself what the Tories did before he criticises us. We are putting right all the problems that they left for us to clear up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend would agree that his Department plays a crucial role in tackling social exclusion, not only in Wales but in all the United Kingdom. Is he aware that the amount that his Department spends in Wales, which is currently £5.7 billion, corresponds almost exactly with the fiscal deficit in Wales—the gap between what is spent and what is raised? Does he agree that rather than launching scurrilous attacks on his presence here today, nationalist spokesmen should answer for the people of Wales how they would meet the social security bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The nationalists in Wales and Scotland cannot answer that question because their sums for independence do not add up when one considers the amount of money spent on the social security system in both those countries. From what I read about the nationalists during the recent Welsh Assembly campaign, I believed that they had abandoned their aim of an independent Wales, but they seem to be in favour of it again. The idea of separatism, whether in Wales or Scotland, is a complete anachronism. It is out of date and, crucially, the people in Wales and Scotland would pay dearly if ever they were to entrust the nationalists with their future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Secretary of State on reading out his litany of facts and figures without falling asleep, and in particular for giving the Committee the view of the Deputy Prime Minister rather than using stock phrases. However, there are some other stock Labour phrases that I should have liked to hear him use in the context of social exclusion such as "redistribution", "social justice" and "equality"—words not in his statement? What does he think of good old-fashioned egalitarianism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman found the note of what we have done to improve life for people in Wales and in the whole country boring. He cannot have been all that uninterested since the first thing that he did on the day that he took his seat in the House was to vote against every single measure. Now he tells us that he could not be bothered to read the list of all the benefits that will be uprated. That will be news to his constituents as well as to the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal directly with his points. Yes, we believe strongly in social justice. That is why we are pledged to eradicate child poverty within a generation. There can be no social justice while there is poverty. He asked about redistribution. He should look at our changes to the state earnings-related pension scheme with a new state second pension. It redistributes money heavily to the low-paid, carers and disabled people with broken work records. We have a record to be proud of, which stands in stark contrast to the sheer opportunism of the nationalists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On 17 July 1998, my right hon. Friend's predecessor said that the campaign for the take-up of minimum income guarantee would start in April 1999. It did not. It has now started and is an imaginative campaign, but it began 14 months after the date that the Government gave. The result is that the poorest pensioners will lose, on average, £1,200 each. Will my right hon. Friend undertake to ensure that when pensioners are found to have missed out on income support that they should have had, they will be given back payments, and that the money required is in the national insurance fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give that undertaking for reasons that my hon. Friend understands perfectly well. I am grateful to him for his welcome for the advertising campaign, which is being shown throughout the country, including in Welsh language adverts being broadcast in Wales. We want to make sure that the 500,000 or so pensioners whom we believe to be entitled to the minimum income guarantee will actually receive it, which is why we are both advertising on television and in other media and writing to everyone whom we believe may be entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome the Secretary of State to his first Welsh Grand Committee and thank him for welcoming me?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and I were both born in Swansea and I lived there for over 30 years, so we both know a good deal more about Wales than the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
does. It would appear that we know a good deal more about social exclusion, too. He has made scant reference to the rural economy in Wales. For many people living in the most rural areas, in west Wales in particular, the price of petrol is now touching 90p a litre, and although rural transport may be improved in some parts, in other parts he must recognise that the car is not a luxury; it is a necessity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must move towards his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State must recognise that the car is a necessity and not a luxury. Will he tell motorists living in the most rural parts of Wales, especially farmers living on £4,500 a year, when they may see some light at the end of this tunnel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, I do not doubt that both hon. Gentlemen know a good deal about Wales, which is presumably why, as Conservatives, they decided to stand outside Wales. Otherwise, they would never have been elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of fuel, he should bear in mind that the fuel escalator about which he complains was introduced when he was in the House supporting the then Government of the day. The difference is that we are trying to improve rural transport. We are also making sure that money raised through fuel tax is reinvested in transport. That is a key difference between our two parties, which is why it is unlikely that he will find a safe haven in Wales in anything like the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask about pensions. I support strongly the general strategy of targeting resources at poorer pensioners. In total, we are giving more than the average earnings index would indicate. Last year, the 75p increase was psychologically a mistake. If inflation in September is again as low as 1.1 per cent., will my right hon. Friend guarantee that there will be a minimum increase of £2 a week?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell my hon. Friend that the pension will go up by at least £2 a week, as we have a fairly good idea of what inflation will be in September. I cannot make a final decision because I am required by law to look at the retail prices index in September, and I will do that. All the forecasts—they are pretty accurate—are that the pension for a single person will go up by at least £2 a week and by £3 for a pensioner couple. I can give my hon. Friend that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend for his earlier remarks. It is important that the Government tackle the problem that we inherited, which is that far too many pensioners are living on income support. It is worth noting that, for most years since the war, the basic state pension has been below income support. That is why we want to increase the income for those who have no other income on which to rely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring the Secretary of State back to his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) on redistribution from the rich to the poor? Does he
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
support the campaign by the right hon. Members for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), and the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) and for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), who want higher pensions and redistribution? Or does he agree with what the Deputy Prime Minister said at the weekend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, my right hon. and hon. Friends to whom the hon. Gentleman refers are not running a campaign of the kind that he describes. We all want to make sure that pensioners share in this country's rising prosperity. We are spending £6.5 billion more than the previous Government planned to spend on pension arrangements. The difference is that half of that money is going to the poorest third of the people in this country. That is redistribution, in the sense that most of the money is going to the poorest people. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's record is quite clear; the facts speak for themselves. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) said, we are spending more than we would have spent, had we simply uprated pensions in line with earnings, which is what I think he wants, because that would have saved the Treasury some £2 billion. However, we are spending most of that money on the poorest pensioners, many of whom live in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement and his presence as a sign that the Government are delivering on devolution by improving the processes of this place, both Parliament as a whole and the Welsh Grand Committee. He made a welcome reference to "Better Wales" as the first document to set out a national plan for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is important for other Departments to work closely with the Assembly to deliver the best quality of life for people in Wales? Will he reinforce his commitment, which he demonstrated with a visit to a school in one of the poorest areas of my constituency some months ago, to ensure that there is effective close working between his Department and the National Assembly for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My cup is overflowing with welcomes. I am not used to that. Members of the Committee can take it from me that the Secretary of State for Social Security is not normally welcomed with such enthusiasm. Who knows? I might even come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend mentions the visit that we made to a school in his constituency, which seems to sum up what the Government are all about. We saw children who were written off under previous Administrations. Many came from disadvantaged and poor backgrounds. They did not expect to do terribly well and were being denied the opportunities that most of us take for granted for our children. That is an example of a school working with other agencies. It was receiving increased resources and making a world of difference to those children. Instead of doors being slammed in their faces from the start, opportunities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
were available to them. There is no reason why those children cannot go on and do well in whatever they want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between members of the Tory party and us is that we want everyone in the country to have opportunity, whereas they were interested in providing opportunity only for the very few at the top. I know that my right hon. Friend contributed quite a lot to the document when he was First Secretary. It is a tribute to him and to all those involved that the Government and the National Assembly will be able to make such progress towards eradicating child poverty and providing opportunity for all those children whom we met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the right hon. Gentleman back to his comment about disability living allowance and the fact that it is not working and needs to be reviewed? At least once a fortnight, I represent constituents before tribunals, 95 per cent. of whom succeed. In some cases, amputees have been denied DLA. The situation under this Government is far worse than under the previous Administration. It is time that he got his act in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, it would be welcome to have an entire Committee on DLA and all the difficulties with it. The fundamental problem with DLA is that it is designed to help people to meet the extra costs incurred as a result of their disabilities. It is not compensation for their disabilities. That is why there are cases in which someone apparently has quite a severe disability, but does not receive as much help as someone else. We must try to calculate what the extra costs are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that some of the tests that we employ are, by their very nature, subjective. It would be the easiest thing in the world to return to the old system, which simply paid out benefits on the basis of some classified or prescribed condition. However, we felt 10 years ago that that was not right and that we should do something more for people whose conditions were not easily categorised, but who had extra costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree that DLA has a number of profound problems, because of its very nature. We are working with many people, including those from organisations that represent disabled people, to improve the tests that we apply in order to get round some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentions. If he does appear at those tribunals every fortnight, he should take it from me that there is no easy quick fix. I suspect that the quickest fix would result in a lot of people losing out. I do not believe that either of us wants that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Affairs Committee has been studying social exclusion in Wales for about seven months. We have received a couple of hundred written submissions and have made 50 visits within Wales and two important visits to Ireland and America. In those countries, the success of moving people from welfare into work has been largely
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
down to tapering-letting people keep their benefits over six months or a year. Does my right hon. Friend have plans to introduce such measures in the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend is quite right that the key to success of all welfare-to-work schemes is to ensure that people can see the difference and that, as soon as they start to work, they are better off. My hon. Friend will be aware that in the Budget we introduced a number of changes to protect the position of people receiving mortgage interest relief so that they would not lose all their money the moment they went to work, and benefit run-ons for lone parents on income support. That is the sort of thing that we want to encourage, so that, from the first week that they are in work, people see the money in their pocket. All the evidence is that if they can see that they will move heaven and earth to stay in work. It is unfortunate that this country did not start to do that until 1997. Frankly, we wasted 20 years. Other countries were doing it long before we did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A high percentage of my constituents are pensioners and disabled people, and the winter fuel payment was very welcome. Not enough has been said about the fact that it is not means tested and not taxable, which makes it worth more than £150. What is the current position concerning men over 60 who should be receiving the winter fuel payment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On my hon. Friend's last point, we are in the process of contacting those over 60. The reason that there has been a delay is that we do not keep a record of people who do not have active contact with the Department of Social Security. It was necessary to find out who they were. In addition, we have been advertising people's entitlement and there is a telephone line to enable people to register their claims over the phone. That process will be completed during the course of this year, enabling people to obtain the money to which they are entitled, in some cases in arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what she said about the winter fuel payment. The fact that it is a lump sum should not be overlooked. For people on low incomes, a lump sum of £150 at the start of the winter, when they are about to meet high electricity bills, is quite substantial. Not only is it a lump sum but, as my hon. Friend said, it is not taken into account for tax or benefit purposes. Most people are now beginning to realise that the Tories are pledged to scrap the winter fuel payment. They plan to bring it together with other payments, tax it, take it into account for benefit, and the result would be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says just the tax. Some 140,000 people would come into the tax system, pensioners would come into the tax system, and 2 million of Britain's poorest pensioners would lose out as a result of what the Tories are proposing. When people look at what we are doing in a genuine attempt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

That is why it is not the initial statement, important though it was, that my right hon. Friend made, but the three-quarters of an hour of questioning that followed it that was so helpful.

Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has just made a long speech without a single reference to rural areas. What is going on here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely unfair. My right hon. Friend did refer to rural areas and, as I have said in previous debates in the House, the measures that the Government have introduced, such as the national minimum wage, the working families tax credit and pensions-related measures are all equally relevant in rural areas as they are in the towns, cities and valleys of Wales. Contrary to what some people think, I accept that there is rural poverty, but that poverty is addressed in the same way that it is addressed elsewhere in Wales. I shall be returning to some specific issues regarding rural areas later in my address.

The Government are acting to reduce pensioner poverty, with 93,000 pensioner households already benefiting from the minimum income guarantee and £40 million spent on the winter fuel allowance alone last year. The Government are also acting on child poverty, and an estimated 50,000 Welsh children will have been lifted out of poverty by the end of this Parliament. We are acting to widen educational opportunity and to reduce ill health. We are acting to get Britain—and Wales—back to work, with 11,000 more people in work in the last three months alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this morning, members of the Committee referred to the joint ministerial committee, which has already met. It has met in Edinburgh, in Cardiff to discuss health, in London and in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if we want to tackle poverty, whether child or pensioner poverty, or any other poverty that afflicts our people, we can only do so by working in partnership as a United Kingdom Government dealing with the issues for which my right hon. Friend is responsible, but also with all the purposes and functions of the National Assembly for Wales. By acting in concert, we are able to tackle those problems in a special way, whereas before we could not. It is one of the strengths of the devolution settlement that we are able to identify specifically problems affecting poverty and the health service, and all the other matters with which we shall be dealing today, and of which we were perhaps unaware before devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Glasgow last week, and in Edinburgh a couple of weeks earlier, I saw Ministers for Health and Social Services from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, working for their own countries in a special way but also working together with the Government, with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health and for Social Security. They are able not only to share ideas but to learn from one another in a special way and to identify the problems that face us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poverty does not know a country border; it has no boundaries in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are special ways in which we can tackle those problems since devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem of poverty has been identified in my community for many a long year. With that in mind, will the Minister explain how, when the Assembly was deciding on the priorities for objective 1, it decided to prioritise and ring-fence some rural villages while not treating even poorer communities in the same way? Will he also explain how the Assembly, in distributing health moneys, totally ignores health deprivation: in particular, the serious health problems in communities like Blaenau Gwent, such as heart disease, respiratory disease and cancer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I would need to take up the detail of that issue with the Assembly, and I will do so. The plan that the Assembly is producing will have to last seven years, and this is only the very beginning. I agree with my hon. Friend. As he knows, I worked in his constituency for 17 years and I understand the problems that face the people of the heads of the valleys communities in Wales. We have to identify that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
specially, which is why objective 1 status, to which I shall refer later, has come to west Wales and the valleys. Those areas need to be lifted out of the poverty that they have inherited over the years. It is comparable with what occurred in Northern Ireland with the loss of the shipbuilding industries, and in Scotland with the loss of steel production and coal mining. The loss of steel and coal jobs in his constituency over the last 20 to 30 years has added to the considerable pocket of poverty that existed in Blaenau Gwent and other parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a statement today from the Secretary of State for Social Security. Will there be a meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee next month with a statement from the Treasury on how much matched funding we will have for objective 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that when the comprehensive spending view is announced, there will be an opportunity for hon. Members to question not just Treasury Ministers but, through whatever mechanism we devise through the usual channels, to discuss it as Welsh Members of Parliament. Again, it means that the Grand Committee, far from being some sort of electioneering platform, gives us an opportunity to do precisely what the hon. Gentleman describes—to cross examine Ministers and to make speeches to put forward our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press my hon. Friend on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I mean for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith)? The average percentage of households in Wales with dependent children and no earner in the family is 18 per cent. One ward in my constituency has 60 per cent. of families in that position. It is the most deprived ward in all of Wales. No objective 1 funding is going there, yet why is objective 1 funding ring-fenced in rural areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ebbw Vale is a good name: after all, the NHS emerged from Ebbw Vale when Nye Bevan represented the constituency. I undertake to raise the matter with the First Secretary in his capacity as Economic Secretary to the Assembly. I understand the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn); he and I share a constituency border. I know his constituency very well and I understand the points that he makes about the considerable pockets of poverty that exist. They exist in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) too, although Monmouth is not covered by objective 1. We must address these pockets of poverty, particularly when we deal with European funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my right hon. Friend has mentioned the deprived community in my constituency. One example that he might have quoted is Llannelly Hill, which used to be covered by the local authority of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith). If it were still
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
in Blaenau Gwent, it would receive objective 1 funding. Does that not show that even if a county like Monmouthshire cannot be on the objective 1 map, Monmouthshire county council should receive additional resources because of the deprivation that exists in an apparently affluent county?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth came to see me some weeks ago with representatives of community councils in Monmouth, including Llannelly Hill, and we discussed those matters. Of course, we must draw a boundary for structural funds somewhere. It is to the credit of my predecessors that they extended that boundary for objective 1 to areas that few of us thought possible. Certainly, the valleys are a classic example of where we should put money in to bring people out of poverty and increase the GDP.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. He has spent some time allaying his hon. Friends' concern about the fact that their areas are not included in the objective 1 area. Does he recognise that a simple answer that he could give them is to agree with us that the Barnett formula needs to be look at? It simply does not address the real needs of Wales in the modern world. Does he agree that that should be looked at as well as objective 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had the argument about the Barnett formula, and doubtless we will have it again. It has served Wales for several decades and, in comparative terms, it is still a good deal for us. I remind the hon. Gentleman that, so far as the European structural fund is concerned, objective 1 status is achieved by the Government of the member state claiming that status from the European Union. We benefit from it because the whole of the British taxpaying system produces money for Wales. It is important to understand that objective 1 European funding—the Barnett formula—means that we must draw upon the British taxpaying system to obtain it. The hon. Gentleman knows that we have to be careful not to go from the frying pan into the fire, because deprivation and poverty exist in many parts of England, including the north-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Barnett formula serves us well; as the years go by, we must look at financial arrangements. However, we must also consider what is happening now; my right hon. Friend outlined our special ways of tackling exclusion and poverty, one of which is to deal with pensions, a matter that concerns every member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some weeks ago, I addressed an association of Welsh pensioners in Porthcawl, whose members were worried about the issues that we discussed earlier today. Our efforts must be concentrated on helping the poorest people. Any map of the United Kingdom that charted social exclusion and poverty among older people would have Wales at the forefront. Within Wales, the poorest would be the pensioners who live in the valleys. That is why the special methods that my right hon. Friend introduced—the winter fuel payment, the television licence, and the minimum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
income guarantee—apply especially to the oldest and poorest pensioners. As my right hon. Friend said, that is not the end of the story. We look forward to new measures to ensure that those in receipt of small occupational benefits and pensions will be treated in a special way too. But those are measures to come. What is so important about our debate is that we can discuss matters in a Welsh context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be aware that the age profile in some parts of Wales is rising faster than the national average. Will the Government take into account the strain that a higher age profile will have on public services when considering their plans for pensioners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security tells me that he has made long-term reforms in that regard. I understand how important the matter is in Wales because people are living longer; other factors must also be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rampant inflation, as bad as it has been in the past, will not help pensioners. By far the worse thing for a pensioner is prices in the local supermarket increasing every week. However, because the sound economic policies of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer have solved the economic problems, we can tackle the social problems that the Committee is considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our commitment to tackling pensioner poverty is not the only dividing line between the parties. Choosing to help people to get back to work rather than spending more and more on the costs of economic failure is another. The new deal has not always been popular with the Conservatives, but it is the right policy. I want to know if it is the Conservative party's policy to abolish it; we know that they want to abolish the working families tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been done in Wales has helped to free young people from the desperation of not having a job. Every Member who represents a Welsh constituency can point to good stories of young men and women who have benefited from this policy. The Assembly has also done much, as hon. Members who sit in the Assembly will be able to confirm. We all applaud the communities first policy, which is a major new approach to community regeneration that will target disadvantaged communities. There has been a further £1 million this year for sustainable communities for the future. The key unifying theme behind our policy initiatives is the importance of people to Wales's future, and there are linked principles of opportunity and of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts of Wales face particular difficulties. I refer to rural Wales, although I must tell the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) who raised the issue that some constituencies in Wales are clearly and obviously rural, but others are clearly and obviously mixed. Many Members represent towns, such as Newport, that include large areas of rural communities. In the valleys of south Wales, there is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
enormous mix between what would be traditionally referred to as a rural community and an urban one, and the same is certainly true further west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must acknowledge issues surrounding urban villages, a matter particular to Wales and perhaps to the north-east of England. We share a common inheritance of old mining villages afflicted both by urban and rural poverty. The United Kingdom Exchequer pumps millions of pounds into our rural economies through agricultural subsidies. We know that the money comes from Europe, but since Britain is a net contributor to the EU budget, in effect almost every penny comes from the British taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsidy is a blunt instrument, however, when it comes to promoting sustainability and social inclusion in rural Britain and rural Wales. Welsh farmers may not be as well off as some of the grain barons of eastern England. Plenty are wealthy and benefit from the crude universality of the current subsidy system, but thousands of families, including many farming families in rural areas, are socially excluded because of poor economic prospects or lack of access to public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for dealing with the rural problem and, in particular, agriculture. About a fortnight ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) and I met Martin Neumann from the European Commission's Directorate-General VI, who was responsible for drawing up the new sheep meat regime. Because 25 per cent. of the UK sheep flock is in Wales, he agreed that Welsh Ministers should have a lead role in deciding the future head. I urge the right hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office to become involved in that regime as it is extremely important to Wales. I welcome what he is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The visit to Brussels was obviously productive in helping us to find out what is going on and what the issues are. I shall certainly take up his point with regard to representations, either by my Department or by whoever would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security touched on post offices, an issue affecting our rural communities that will soon be raised in the House. Post offices act as a focal point for communities, not just for issuing benefits, not just for post office services, but in a variety of other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House and this Committee might have to wait a bit longer—until some time in July—for the outcome of the spending review, and, hence, for details of the Government's financial support for the objective 1 programme. We all know the importance of objective 1 funding in giving a one-off boost to economic performance and economic opportunity in west Wales and the valleys. Objective 1 presents a unique situation in terms of the Welsh block and the operation of the Barnett formula to which the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I once again outline some of the basic facts about objective 1, because its whole basis is recognition of the social exclusion so prevalent in the valleys and west Wales. First of all, of course, the Government might simply not have bothered. That, after all, is what the Conservative Government did in their 18 years in office. Once again they promise to be a do-nothing Government on this issue if they are returned to power. Worse than doing nothing however, is doing less than nothing. How else are we to interpret the words of the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), the shadow Chief Secretary? They are worth repeating: we have done so on a number of occasions because he provided a gem. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Instead of scrabbling around trying to increase the level of handouts from the EU budget for those regions, why do not the Government tackle the real issue, which is that for every £2 we pay into the EU budget we get £1 back?—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 February 2000; Vol. 343, c. 1192.]</p></blockquote>
That is a considerable dampening of enthusiasm, to say the least, for the whole concept of structural funding coming to Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. I will concede that in some ways the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury has a point. I fear that it is not a very comfortable one for the Welsh nationalists—it is precisely because Britain is such a huge net contributor to the European Union's budget that money for the structural funds coming to Britain comes not from the bankers of Bonn or the gnomes of Zurich but from Britain. It is the taxpayers of London, Leeds, Guildford and Glasgow, as well as those of Cardiff, Wrexham, Torfaen and Newport, who pay for objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 is a huge commitment from the United Kingdom Government and taxpayer to tackling social exclusion and poor economic performance in west Wales and the valleys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could see that the right hon. Gentleman was ready to pounce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was winding myself up. I accept that money from the UK Treasury goes to Brussels, but was it possible for Ministers dealing with England to get a deal for the regions of England—Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Cornwall—to ensure that there is full match funding? A report in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> last week referred to this deal, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>The agreement brought a guarded welcome in these regions … but a more highly-charged argument about matched funding for a bigger programme in Wales has yet to be resolved.</p></blockquote>
How is it that the same money goes from the Treasury and back again, and how was it possible to achieve a deal in advance of the comprehensive spending review for regions in England, when we have not yet cut a deal for Wales to ensure that we get both additionality and match funding without raiding the budget for health and education for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must not believe everything that he reads—not even in the 	<i>Financial Times.</i> The Department for Trade and Industry has identified within its current regional selective assistance budget a commitment to regional selective assistance for South Yorkshire, Merseyside and Cornwall. That does not provide any additional money, which remains a matter for the spending review just as it is for Wales. It involves existing money from the regional selective assistance for only one Department. The right hon. Gentleman knows of course, and he spoken to me before on these important issues, that funding in England comes from a variety of different UK departments, including the DTI and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by the right hon. Gentleman is not yet resolved as the article in question refers, in a rather exaggerated way, only to regional selective assistance that has already been allocated and which will be divided between the regions. The rest of the negotiation is still a matter for the spending review. The right hon. Gentleman understands that we are different in Wales because of the block system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom Government went out to secure objective 1—in effect, permission for Europe to use our tax revenues to offer state aid—and that is a sign of the real strength that Wales derives from being part of the United Kingdom. That strength allows us to invest in social justice through providing more money for the poorest pensioners, and to get Wales back to work through the new deal or through objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Conservatives achieved power, or if we had an independent Wales, the Administration would be forced to scrap objective 1 as it would not be sustainable in the way it is under a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense in some of the comments on objective 1 that the right hon. Gentleman is softening up the Committee for something of a disappointment in the spending review. He suggested it might be useful to have Treasury Ministers here so that we could question them about the review. He has discussed the problems in his negotiations. Is he suggesting that he will not receive full match funding from the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not read into my remarks what is not there. Let me make the position clear on the spending review. It will be announced some time next month. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or other Treasury Minister, will announce it on the Floor of the House. I hope that there will be a further opportunity for the Welsh Grand Committee to question me on the issues, but there will certainly be an opportunity for everyone to question Treasury Ministers in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's idea of softening is nonsensical. Objective 1 and the issues to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security referred—benefits, pensions and so forth—must be seen in the context of the partnership to which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
I referred. It is a partnership between the UK Government and the National Assembly. I am not arguing that Plaid Cymru would want to scrap objective 1, though I am not so sure about the Conservative party. However, unless Plaid Cymru can tell the Committee that it has found a new source of gold beneath the Welsh hills, the nationalists have no choice but to admit that an independent Wales simply would not have the money to finance an objective 1 programme. We might receive some grants from Europe, but where would the nationalists find the money to pay for one penny of match funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) spoke to the Committee about an independent Wales—though what exactly that is, we must wait and see. It will be interesting in the coming weeks to see whether the hon. Member for Ynys Môn and anyone else who contends to succeed the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) can provide an effective definition of independence or of a separate Wales. We shall watch what happens with great interest, but irrespective of what happens, there will be an element of self-governance in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State comment on the words of Cynog Dafis, an Assembly Member and formerly a Member of this House, when he said that self-government is what we used to call independence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why we await with such interest the outcome of deliberations in the Welsh nationalist party. Whatever happens, an independent Wales would have to spend in ways that a devolved Wales would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not on Trident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the experts tell us that there is a substantial deficit. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli referred to about £5 billion. We must examine the details, but no one—certainly not the people that I represent—believes that an independent Wales would be economically sustainable. It would not be able to provide the benefits to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security referred earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my right hon. Friend notice earlier in his speech the great interest of the Plaid Cymru Benches in the Barnett formula, which delivers to Wales 15 per cent. more per capita than it does to the people of England. A self-governing Wales would lose that Barnett formula. At a stroke, funds for pensions, the health service and education would be cut by 15 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that Wales would face enormous problems if it were independent. No way could the Welsh people receive the same benefits from the UK Government if Wales were entirely independent. Social exclusion can be tackled only by the UK Government working in partnership with the Assembly. Through that partnership can we secure the best for the people of Wales in respect of health, education, social services and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
People must make choices, but the Welsh people understand, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security said, that they can never trust the Conservatives to look after their pensions, benefits and social status. Why do we have such social exclusion in Wales? It is because of 20 years of neglect by the Conservatives as well as the structural problems of Wales's staple industries. Do the Welsh people believe that their salvation lies in independence? Of course they do not. They can best be served as they have been in the past three years—and will in the years ahead—by a partnership between a Labour Government working for the people of Wales in London and a Labour Assembly in Cardiff. Only through that partnership can we achieve the better society that we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity for a tiny debate on social exclusion in Wales. The Welsh Affairs Committee has held longer debates and produced a report, and the UNICEF report published last week examined the Government's achievements a year after delivery in the third year of their reign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was disappointing to hear the Secretary of State show such a lack of faith in the future of Wales and to see his supporters show their lack of understanding of Welsh needs and how to address them. The Secretary of State's speech was full of the handout mentality—the idea that Wales is going cap in hand to "Big Brother" to receive its allotted due. I had thought that the Government now believed in the hand up, not the handout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to objective 1 funding in the European Union, the Secretary of State knows full well that Ireland and other EU countries are doing well. He also knows only too well that for many years under the Conservative Administration, Wales did not receive a penny of match funding. One of the reasons why we are debating social exclusion today is that for many years under the previous Government we received only crumbs from structural funding, never the full piece we needed to revive our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend add to that point that we never received a penny for objective 1 during the first year of a Labour Government either?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There was not one penny piece, and I am sure that my hon. Friend's constituency experience is the same as mine—scores of projects waiting for an application form. That is the truth of objective 1 so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating social exclusion, but I shall start by referring to a picture of social inclusion and I shall start at the top. Tomorrow a certain young gentleman will come of age. He has been privately educated and shielded from the excesses of the press. He will soon go to university. The fascinating question is not which university he goes to, but whether he turns up on the first day of his course. He has an elderly grandmother who lives on state aid and who will soon receive a

congratulatory telegram from the Queen. What will this young man do when he leaves school? An amazing 50 per cent. of the population believe that he should do whatever he wants to when he leaves school, and 9 per cent. believe that he should learn about his duties ahead. He is a particularly privileged person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the average Sion or Sian Cyffredin in Wales who is turning 18 tomorrow? What sort of future can they look forward to? What adult work are they looking towards? As the Secretary of State acknowledged, they are living in the poorest country in United Kingdom, where 53 per cent. of households earn less than £10,000 a year. More than half the households in some areas have no savings at all, and 40 per cent. of the Welsh population have never saved. The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) was right to say that credit unions are an important part of tackling social exclusion, but they have not had a high profile in the Government's current strategy—not yet anyway. Around 20 per cent. of households claim housing benefit. Rather than being privately educated, the people who live in them may be among the 22 per cent. who have no qualifications whatever. In terms of rural exclusion, I am pleased to say that Ceredigion has the lowest no-qualification rate at 14 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, under many years of local authority attention to education. I am sure that the situation in Powys is similar. Nearly half our cohort of 11-year-olds are failing to reach the mark in all the core subjects, perhaps partly due to the excessively high level of mitching in Welsh schools or the number of exclusions, which has increased in direct proportion to the amount of attention paid to league tables and exam results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a young person who is excluded from school. What is his or her education then? I regret to say that in my constituency under my local authority—this is not an exception—that excluded person would receive a maximum of six hours a week in tuition outside the school system. How on earth can a person starting on the path to social exclusion be included in the economy, in training and society, when he or she receives six hours' tuition? In fact, many excluded children receive only one hour of tuition a week, because they have many difficulties in attending the right place and tuition is delivered to them elsewhere. It is even more worrying that 46 per cent. of all our Sion and Sian Cyffredins—our average working people in Wales—have received no training in the past year. Our path to objective 1 starts from that low base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than opening their homes to summer visitors, as some do, such people live in unfit accommodation: 8 per cent. of Welsh homes are so defined. Nearly one fifth lacks central heating or exclusive use of bathroom facilities. I realise that those
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
figures are slightly old, and that there is no up-to-date in-depth housing conditions survey for Wales. Perhaps the Secretary of State will consider addressing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than taking things easy or doing what they want, those children could grow up to be among the 10 per cent. of adults treated for depression or anxiety, or the 16 per cent. who have a limiting long-term illness or disability. That background of health inequality goes some way towards explaining the inordinately high suicide levels in rural areas. In Ceredigion, there are 24 suicides per 100,000 people. I regret to say that the same figure is true for Powys and, I believe, for Denbighshire. Those high suicide levels are a signal of real social exclusion in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sian Cyffredin is a young woman who may well become pregnant. Sadly, the average number of pregnancies between the ages of 15 and 17 is 51 per 1,000 in Wales, compared with the English figure of 44 per 1,000. The parenting that she received may have been poor. Eight per cent. of the Welsh population are divorced or separated, and 18 per cent. of households with children—I think that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said 20 per cent.—do not have a wage-earner. We have at last found something in common between Sion and Sian Cyffredin and the gentleman who is celebrating his birthday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh picture of social exclusion matches the picture for the UK as a whole. Since 1979, the poorest 10 per cent. have suffered a fall of 9 per cent. in their real income. While the average income went up by 44 per cent., the top 10 per cent. of incomes went up by 70 per cent. I do not believe that the Government want that situation to become embedded in our culture any more than I do. We want to get away from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risk of poverty for some groups has increased drastically. In 1979, the risk of poverty for single pensioners was 12 per cent.; it is now 35 per cent. For single people with children, the risk of poverty in 1979 was 10 per cent., whereas it is now 62 per cent., according to the Government's figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NCH fact files paint a realistic portrait of what it is like to grow up in poverty. The children describe in their own words how there are not enough rooms to accommodate the family, and they must sleep in the lounge on sofas, on friends' floors or wherever they can find accommodation. Most of their parents have never worked. Many regularly go without meals, have a poor diet, smoke and drink. A third are regular users of illegal drugs. Most of the poorest children are bullied at school. They are not the perpetrators of bullying. Many people think that children from bad backgrounds behave badly, when in fact they are the subject of bullying. However, their reaction to that makes them more likely to be excluded from school and to suffer a disrupted education. More than half of those children are involved in crime.

I hope that Ministers will visit the Hope for Young People Everywhere organisation in my constituency. It would be an eye-opener for them on the reality of rural poverty. Rural areas may not command the same numbers as urban areas, but their problem are just as real. A mother in Aberystwyth set up HYPE after her
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
son died in unfortunate circumstances connected with methadone. After only 18 months of operation, HYPE sees 80 children and young people a week in a small cramped office in Aberystwyth town centre, which one could pass many times a day without noticing. Its name is passed on by word of mouth; no advertising is used, so its services are accessed only because children and young people who need them look after one another, like a family to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HYPE sees the problems of the hidden homeless, who sleep rough or on friends' floors. I regret the fact that Ceredigion, and Aberystwyth particularly, has a big homeless problem. Aberystwyth has an active Big Issue campaign, and I welcome its support for the homeless in the town. Three homeless people associated with that campaign died in Aberystwyth recently. Three deaths in a rural town with a population of about 10,000 is excessive and shows the depth of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HYPE helps young people with financial and criminal problems. The children are mostly local, and many have been excluded from school. Many have been or will end up in foster care. There is no duty to find homes or housing for young people over 18, and because the single room rent rates price many out of the market in Aberystwyth—the university means that the town has a buoyant housing market—more young people are living on the street and travelling back and forth between friends' houses and HYPE. I look forward to debating the Children (Leaving Care) Bill, which I hope will introduce further measures to support young people in such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit does not cover the cost of renting in my constituency. Of course, many landlords believe that they protect themselves by refusing to take people on social security benefits. The number of houses in multiple occupation in Aberystwyth and Ceredigion has exploded. I regret to say that home renovation grants have funded that. The Government would have my support in examining how such grants are used without regulation to improve private homes that are then turned into HMOs. It is a disgrace that landlords keep those homes and force people to live in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met several young people on Friday who have received crisis loans. Despite what the Secretary of State says, inordinate delays affect applications for the jobseeker's allowance. It may be a local problem, but many young people must wait four or five weeks for their payments to arrive, and many are now being refused crisis loans because the local funds are exhausted. Young people in such desperate situations have no protection. Voluntary organisations such as HYPE are picking up the pieces of social exclusion in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More foyer schemes or access hostels must be rolled out in rural areas, to allow young people to be supported or integrated back into training and the community, to give them opportunities in the job market. I acknowledge that more jobs are available, but I feel strongly that employers exclude a core group of people from those jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and the Secretary of State touched on social exclusion in a short exchange. Rural post offices play a crucial role in delivering services to local communities. I hope that their role as local service and delivery providers will be enhanced and that post offices will liaise not only with banks on delivery of pensions and benefit payments, but with credit unions. They may become the bridge between some of our most excluded communities, such as black and ethnic minorities in Wales, few of whose members have bank accounts. Many pensioners in rural areas do not have bank accounts. A local credit union with that friendly face might be a bridge. I hope that the Secretary of State and his colleagues will look at how credit unions can be part of the payments system for benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a huge lack of medical facilities. In rural areas it often takes as long as an hour and a quarter to travel to hospital for treatment, which leads to health inequality. There are lower wages, which is acknowledged in the objective 1 programme. There is also a lack of training opportunities and a shortage of new technology. There is no broad-band communication anywhere close to my constituency. Whereas the other areas seem to be looking forward to the dot.com revolution and powering themselves out of social exclusion by means of new technology, small companies such as CyberCall, which has set up in Ceredigion, have had to pay to bring in the sort of infrastructure that would be easily available as a matter of course in Cardiff, Swansea or London. That is an extra cost disadvantage to the sort of new technology setting up in rural areas. Objective 1 has been one of the key successes in Ireland, which has used training and objective 1 to acquire those new technologies. The problem in rural Wales has been looked at in the objective 1 programme, but it must also be addressed at a UK Government level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the context in which the recent UNICEF report found so much wanting in the UK. The report has been described as "damning". I acknowledge that it looks at relative poverty and is slightly retrospective, but it is nevertheless a the benchmark international report. It describes how nearly 20 per cent. of our young people live in families below the poverty line. That is worse than Turkey, Poland and Hungary. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I thought that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) wanted to intervene, but he simply wants a glass of water. I am pleased to see that he is still here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is relative poverty, but even taking absolute poverty, which is defined as households below the official US poverty line, the UK is still in the bottom quarter. Of the 19 countries that UNICEF looked at in detail, the UK came 14th, just above Italy. The report identified five key weaknesses. Whether hon. Members take this as a retrospective or statistically out-dated report, those weaknesses are still there. They are child poverty, lone parent families, workless households, people on low wages and people on low benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The Government have set out to eliminate child poverty in 20 years. That is a hugely ambitious task, which I certainly welcome. The report acknowledges that much progress has been made on that, but says that there is a huge amount still to do. The Child Poverty Action Group has looked at that immense amount of work and at the 50 indicators. We no longer talk about just income as an element, or benefits or pensions. Those 50 indicators are how we will measure whether we have eliminated child poverty in Wales and the rest of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most useful measures is half of average income after housing costs. The Government have decided to use that to measure progress on this. An independent analysis in the "The New Economy" by Professor David Piachaud identified the fact that the Government needs to accelerate their child poverty programme. At the current rate of progress, only two thirds of poverty would be abolished in 20 years. The Government want to abolish it by 100 per cent. Abolishing two thirds of poverty merely takes us back to where we were in 1979. In other words, we would have taken two steps forward and four steps back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Piachaud argues that if those who remain in poverty are to keep up, let alone catch up with the rest of society, the redistribution will have to increase. There is a warning there for Labour Members, many of whom have a secret desire to follow the old faith: they must look for ways to address their Government's policy to increase redistribution from the Back Benches. The half-of-average-income baseline is already too little to lift people out of deprivation and social exclusion. It does not recognise how much money is needed not to be poor. We need radical thinking, perhaps along the lines of a minimum participation income society, to get out of this situation in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this a realistic political prospect? Economically, I regret to say that it is. I regret to say it because it is always the argument put by the Government against tackling social exclusion in a more hard-headed way, but economically we cannot afford it. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates that the cost of bringing everyone up to the current level of half average income, eliminating child poverty, is about 1 per cent. of GDP. It is a huge amount of money, but a small political change is needed, and it is something that is within the Government's capabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All Labour Members are listening intently because we agree with 80 to 90 per cent. of the hon. Gentleman's analysis. I am glad that in his later comments he gave credit to the Government for making considerable movements in the right direction. In my constituency, unemployment has dropped from 1,556 when the Government were elected to 1,075. That is a third of the way to eliminating unemployment. Will the hon. Gentleman give credit for that as being part of tackling social exclusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
At the beginning of his speech, he referred to education. Does he agree with yesterday's report from the Institute of Welsh Affairs asking for objective 1 money to go heavily into education and especially into further education colleges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the latter point, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I am not sure that I want to use objective 1 money for education, because that would be substituting what the Government should do anyway. But objective 1 money should have a slant towards training. That is something that is expected in my area, and I am sure in his constituency also. I accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly acknowledge the drop in unemployment as it is measured. What I would emphasise, however, is that it is one statistic out of a range of 50 indicators that we are using for indicating poverty. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has the same problems that I have, that there are jobs that are extremely badly paid and uncertain. Many people coming off the new deal have been successfully trained and have a good background, but they are going into very short-term jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, especially among young people and those with ambition, there is a great deal of economic migration out of rural Wales, in particular to areas with better economic conditions? Population exchange is taking place with older people coming in, and that distorts employment as well as housing statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there is a good deal of truth in what the hon. Gentleman says. His hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) mentioned the changing demography. Ceredigion has the highest number of over-70s in the whole of Wales, which is due to the inward migration of people who are retiring and the outward migration of younger people. It has become so bad that a database has had to be set up to keep track of people who are leaving rural Wales. We hope to be able to use that database to entice people back with business and entrepreneurial ideas within objective 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the Government have taken responsibility for the level of relative poverty. That is a big change from the previous Government. Now the question is, what will they do to deliver on it? The news is not too good on this. The Government seem to view the welfare state as an enabler. We know what "enabling" means from Tory days—not a hand-up or a handout, but a hand-off. I have here a recent Government publication, which is really new Labour propaganda. It is a speech by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, who refers to the new welfare state as an "enabler" and speaks of the need to foster enterprise. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>As a society we celebrate the enterprise of entrepreneurs like Richard Branson, James Dyson and Martha Lane-Fox.</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether she is to be celebrated for much longer.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yet our innovators and wealth creators still come from too narrow a section of society. The challenge is to enable more people to fulfil their potential as wealth creators for themselves and their communities.</p></blockquote>
This is the latest wacky idea from the Government to try to encourage people out of social exclusion—the dot.com revolution. I have already explained that the dot.com revolution cannot deliver in rural areas because we do not have the infrastructure for it. That is the failure of the Government's vision. They are all talk but they have not delivered. Some hon. Members are recusants from the new faith but they know that there is a lot of truth in what is being said. The following incredible words were overlooked in the Prime Minister's speech to the Women's Institute:
	<br><blockquote><p>Neither of us—</p></blockquote>
the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer—
	<br><blockquote><p>will have any truck with old-fashioned egalitarianism.</p></blockquote>
I have a lot of truck with old-fashioned egalitarianism and so do other Opposition Members. As Lord Hattersley said when he heard those words, that is when I would have started slow handclapping, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not to blame for the failure over 20 years of trickle-down economics—Reaganomics, or whatever it was called—but they are to blame for not getting their act together fast enough and radically enough to tackle social exclusion in Wales. They will be tested on the comprehensive spending review and on their ability to deliver the full objective 1 programme for Wales, which, as the First Secretary said, is the key to tackling social exclusion. We look forward to the announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Today we have an opportunity to air this important subject before drafting our report for the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. We have most of the evidence and members of that Committee, including the conscientious hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), have been examining the subject since November. The Committee decided to tackle the problem after discussion about the absence of a social exclusion unit in Wales. The matter grew so much that since taking that decision eight months ago we have received more than 100 submissions from 82 organisations and individuals in Wales and elsewhere. So far, we have held seven formal evidence sessions, four of them in Wales, and two more are planned. We made many informal visits all over Wales, from Holyhead to Llanelli Hill in Monmouthshire. In March, we visited the Republic of Ireland to see how they used objective 1 money to tackle social exclusion, and last week we visited the United States of America to see how excluded communities are being regenerated. I shall refer to that visit later in order to inform certain members of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
We had informal briefings from the head of the social exclusion unit in London and from officials of the National Assembly social exclusion branch. We held two informal seminars with academics in north and south Wales—that is a useful facility that I recommend to other Select Committees—and a meeting with Professor Peter Townsend, the renowned scholar on the subject. We met representatives of ethnic minority groups in Cardiff and we plan to meet a range of young people in Machynlleth next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee recognises that social exclusion overlaps the responsibilities of central and devolved Government and therefore requires close co-operation with the National Assembly for Wales. Despite persuading the Select Committee on Procedure to agree to ad hoc arrangements for joint meetings, the tight programme to which the Assembly Committees adhere means that it has not been possible to pursue a joint inquiry as the Select Committee wanted. However, that may come in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee's inquiry focused on poverty and financial exclusion, not least because those are the matters that most clearly fall within the Government's responsibility. The Select Committee does not want to define the inquiry too tightly, but to allow witnesses to tell us what are the main issues. Inevitably, therefore, it has covered health and housing, for which responsibility has been devolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are liaising with the panel and Chairs of the Assembly Committee, holding regular meetings—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The dreaded mobile phone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee will report its findings to the House in due course, and it would be wrong to anticipate our conclusions. Among the issues that have emerged so far from the evidence is that of the social exclusion unit in Wales. How to deal with the poverty trap was mentioned earlier in relation to welfare to work. We all agree that welfare to work is a good idea, but if benefits were tapered and we were certain of a quick restoration of benefits after a job loss, that would help in the take-up of job opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a need for training and work experience, not only in the sense of going to work and trying it out, but training for a work ethic, which, sadly, many young people do not have. We heard a chilling statement in the United States of America. A group of young people had been asked what they considered to be an excellent attendance record at work. The average response was three days, which was slightly frightening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the lack of access to simple banking facilities-a matter on which I shall expand later. There is consensus among all community groups to whom we talked that projects aimed at increasing local prosperity must have the support of ordinary members of the community if they are to be successful.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Simply involving the great and the good locally is not enough. Much time is spent on working out grant applications, which often relate to short-term funding. That takes up a lot of time that could otherwise be spent working on the project. Has the right balance been struck between short and medium-term grant aid? If a particular grant regime is working, why change it? There seems to be an obsession with short-term grants for specific goals, such as, "This year, we shall undertake local environment improvements." Often, there is no money for on-going support projects, which sometimes cause the collapse of genuinely good projects after two to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United States, charitable foundations, some of which are small, are important players in tackling social exclusion. Can that be replicated in the United Kingdom? Is our tax system generous enough to encourage the type of charitable giving that seems to be routine in the United States? When we were there, we talked to high-powered people and examined some imaginative schemes. For the education of members of the Committee, particularly the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), such was the worth of our visit to the United States, I shall expand on a few such schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend does so, will he ask the hon. Member for Ribble Valley whether he had studied our proposals for the visit? Did he know where we would visit and to whom we would talk? Was he able to name one place that we visited or one person to whom we talked before he made such scurrilous comments to the press?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ribble Valley laughs, but that is his usual response. The problem is that the hon.

Friend to intervene in his speech to find out what he had learned. However, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley will already know about it because I am about to tell him what we did. The idea that the trip was a completely ridiculous waste of money, which the hon. Gentleman was quoted as saying in the 	<i>Daily Post,</i> is a bit rich coming from him. I wonder if Malev Airlines, Danubius Hotels, Powergen, the Egyptian Government, the Chinese Association for International Understanding, the Britain Club and the Parliament of Azerbaijan thought that they received value for money from the hon. Gentleman. He visited Hungary, Egypt, China and Azerbaijan in an 18-month period last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee visited Washington first, which is normal when visiting the United States. That was mainly because we have a certain level of devolution, but they have a greater level in a federal
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
system. In Washington, we met the Assistant Secretary of the Employment and Training Administration of the US Department of Labor, Mr. Raymond L. Bramucci, who told us about the Workforce Investment Act. We do not have such a provision here. It addresses the fact that the market does not yield sufficient entry-level jobs or training. The idea behind it was that local boards would be arbiters of how federal money is used locally. If employers were prepared to participate and invest in the system, training would be directly linked to local economic needs. Previously, training and economic needs were disconnected, and training was seen a second class alternative to college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new approach in the United States is to try to inculcate a culture of lifelong learning. The Act provides for individual training accounts, which enable individuals to take responsibility for their own training, in response to the needs of the local marketplace. About 12 million children in the United States do not have a high-school diploma, and the Department of Labor considers that they require intervention rather than facilitation. Many of them completely lack a disciplined approach and do not understand that work involves turning up five days a week, which explains the astonishing comment that three days a week is an excellent work record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 118 job corps centres, which cost a significant amount, and which are generally considered to be expensive but effective. The centres are residential and primarily aimed at assisting high-school drop-outs to achieve their high-school diploma. Welfare recipients, food stamps recipients and the like obtain their services from the centres. The job corps programme provides support and residence for young people going to college. The average stay is eight months, but clients can stay for as long as three years. There is also a youth opportunity programme, which seems somewhat better than the youth opportunities programme that the Tories introduced. The $250 million programme, which the President recently announced, has requested proposals for schemes from community groups for local facilities to motivate excluded young people and alliances with employers to provide career paths. The programme was funded for two years, with the possibility of a three-year extension. The Department of Labor has gone to great lengths to establish the credibility of the grantees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to wait and see.

We also met Keith E. Laughlin, who is Associate Director for Sustainable Development on the President's Council on Environmental Quality. He made one comment that is pertinent to what we are discussing today. He referred to the White House Task-force on Livable Communities, which recently produced a report entitled, "Building Livable Communities", of which we have a copy. It looks at issues such as environmental protection and affordable housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also visited one of the oldest think tanks in the United States, the Brookings Institution. We discussed the Welfare Act passed in 1996, which altered the US system in relation to time-limited dependence on benefits, but put little emphasis on providing support for work. Spending on the earned income tax credit is now $30 billion. We are also trying that approach. However, there is a difference in terminology between the UK and the US. Welfare to work in the UK is focused on deprived young people, whereas in the US the focus is on reducing welfare dependency of single mothers. Programmes on youth employment have had limited success. The job corps programme was thought to be more useful than other programmes. I could discuss that at length, because we learned a great deal from them, but I realise that other hon. Members want to speak and it is nearly 1 o'clock.

We also met people from the Center for Law and Social Policy. They are working on income security programmes using cash or vouchers—they can relate to families in which no one is employed—and programmes that relate to the low paid. In the past six years, much more control has been delegated to the states and a tougher approach to benefits has been adopted. Before 1996, parents who avoided work received most of their benefits on the grounds of protection of children. That is no longer the case. The balance has swung towards using benefits to lever people into work.

The emphasis on training the unemployed has lessened. The new tendency is to expect people to find employment and then train. The argument is that once people start to work, they will naturally rise in the labour market. However, little empirical evidence supports that view.

Annual federal child care support amounts to about $3 billion, to which the head start programme adds about $4 billion. Between 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. of the eligible population receives child care support. Each state has enormous discretion in setting the rules. Some operate on the basis that they will not be able to support every eligible family. There is a variety of approaches. For example, Rhode Island guarantees child care to every eligible child in every family below a specified income level. Child care in that context extends to after-school clubs and care for children of shift workers. However, the extent to which such initiatives are implemented is a matter for the states.

The annual federal block grant, which provides cash assistance for low-income families, is worth about $16 billion and is ring-fenced. Part of that money is channelled into family formation policies, which promote two-parent families and the prevention of birth out of wedlock, partly by promoting abstinence.

We attended a seminar hosted by Michael Arthur from the British embassy. We heard good presentations by Dr. Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings institution, and Professor John Goering, from the school of public affairs at Baruch college in the city university of New York. Another renowned academic that we met, Dr. Wendall Primas, is visiting the other place today. Later, he may be able to discuss what he has seen here. We also heard a presentation from Gary Burtless and had a useful discussion about supplemental security income for disabled people and the poor take-up of benefits from which the US suffers.

It was interesting and striking to learn that because the US has now changed its rules and people are coming off direct welfare and into work, people are falling out of the system for food stamps and Medicaid, which is their support for work. The number of claimants has dropped by 40 per cent. It would no doubt please the Exchequer if such a drop were mirrored here, but that would not help to tackle social exclusion.

We went to Pittsburgh, primarily because it has much in common with parts of Wales. Its steel industry has contracted painfully in the past 30 years. In the early 1980s, 100,000 jobs were lost, and steel mills closed daily. The manufacturing sector was heavily dependent on iron and steel, but steel overshadowed four other economic sectors that already existed, which are now coming to the fore. Pittsburgh has two research universities. One concentrates mainly on health sciences and the other concentrates on computing. Both of them are now attracting much research funding, which produces spin-offs in biotechnology and high-tech computing. The area also has an environmental technology resource. Pittsburgh was very polluted, so it learned a lot and now sells its technology abroad. Two major banks provide the foundations for growth in financial services, and US Airways is based in Pittsburgh. Perhaps the national airline that Plaid Cymru wants would be similar to that, but I doubt it.

We spoke to Professor Morton Coleman and to Robert Pease, the executive director of the Allegheny conference on community development, and we saw a regional development corporation project called Keystone Commons. That is an enormous converted factory building, which provides much work space for new small and medium-sized enterprises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
