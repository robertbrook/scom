	<time>Tuesday 4 April 2000</time>
	<p>	<i>(Afternoon)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. BARRY JONES 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Budget Statement and Implications for Wales</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i> [	<i>this day</i>],
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Budget statement and its implications for Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Paul Murphy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was informing members of the Committee earlier this afternoon, we are considering the impact of the Budget on the people of Wales and whether it satisfies the requirements and aspirations of traditional Labour voters or whether it is a middle England Budget. I suggested—this clearly went against the views of Labour Members—that the Chancellor could not do both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, however, be right to acknowledge that there is good news in the Budget. We welcome the roughly £100 million allocation for the health service and the £50 million for education. We could be churlish and say, "About time, too" but we will not do so on this occasion. However, in the past three years, following on from the underfunding under the previous Conservative Administration, health trusts in Wales have amassed deficits totalling £18 million. The reason for that is simple: the incoming Labour Administration accepted the spending plans that the previous Conservative Government had set out. We hope that the money can be put to good use once those deficits have been cleared—and they must be cleared, otherwise many of our trusts will be in serious difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that we want the money that is allocated for education to go to our schools, and the National Assembly was right to decide that it should be allocated through our local authorities. However, to allay the concerns of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter), who chided the Assembly for that decision, I should say that the Assembly resolved last week to ensure that local authorities understand that the money should be allocated to our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In several of today's exchanges, I have detected an uncomfortable fact with which many hon. Members must come to terms. The decision-making process under which the money will be allocated is a matter for the National Assembly—after all, that is what devolution is about. The real party of Wales will make sure that the money is allocated and well spent—in partnership. It is remarkable that there is partnership and co-operation in the National Assembly and that people work together—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why Alun Michael is still First Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us deal with that. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that Rhodri Morgan was not the choice of ordinary members of the Labour party? Would he like to respond to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. The hon. Gentleman understands that partnership, co-operation and working together are the language of Welsh Labour in the Assembly. In the House of Commons, however, we have representatives of old Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that we have something other than the language of partnership. How many times has he visited the House of Commons over the past two years? I can count his visits on the fingers of fewer than two hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should go back to school to learn his maths. I have been here on more occasions than can be counted on the hands of two fingers. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Let me explain it to the hon. Gentleman. He fought the 1997 election on the basis that we are heralding a new kind of politics in Wales. He understood what devolution was about. He fought on the basis that a National Assembly would be set up in Wales that would involve co-operative politics. It may come as a shock to Labour Members, but the language that I hear from them today is not the language that I hear from their colleagues in the National Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way any more. The hon. Gentleman has had ample opportunity to make his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us come back to the issue of whom the Budget addresses. Does it address the underlying concerns of the people of Wales, or is it designed to ensure that the Labour party retains the votes of middle England? Let us put one fundamental issue to the test. When the Labour Government talk about the comprehensive spending review, it is set in tables of stone for Wales. Nothing can be done until it is decided. When we talk about additionality and match funding and about people whose lives have been destroyed by 18 years of Conservative Government, we are told that we have to wait until the comprehensive spending review is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when it suits the Chancellor or the Prime Minister to breach that comprehensive review, they do so. We welcome that and make no bones about it. We want more money for health, education and transport. But what about the economy of Wales? It is on its knees and not a single penny in the Assembly's budget has been allocated to Wales by the European Union. Let us remember that there was not a single penny of European money or match funding under 18 years of Conservative Government. But the people of Wales voted for change. The valleys and rural west and north Wales carry some of the lowest incomes in Europe. That money is needed to build up the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be an opportunity for the hon. Lady to speak later. [Hon. Members: Give way!]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will later. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] This is utterly remarkable. It is the kind of politics that we thought we had left behind. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Look what partnership means to the Labour party. That money must be put into the National Assembly budget to make sure that the people of Wales have it in full. As the Secretary of State knows perfectly well, the £100 million that has been allocated for health in Wales and the £50 million for education is not in any way based on the needs of the people of Wales. It follows a rigid formula, based on population, that takes no account of the fact that Wales needs extra funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must convince the Government that we cannot use that formula to deliver match funding to Wales. Also, the principle of additionality must be over and above that block. We need that assurance from the Secretary of State and we need it from the Minister when he replies to the debate. But the mantra will be repeated: "You must wait until the comprehensive spending review".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] In his Budget speech, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared to work in consultation with charities and voluntary organisations
	<br><blockquote><p>with cash allocated in our spending review—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 866.]</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend agree that that was a commitment, not to a sum, but to allocate cash in the spending review? If the Chancellor had given such a commitment to the people and the economy of Wales, it would have been welcomed with open arms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it would. The comprehensive spending review is a mantra, enabling the Chancellor to say, "For Wales, no; for spending patterns in England, yes, of course."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Betty Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Wiliams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I guess that the hon. Gentleman wants to partner his colleague the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) rather than me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, had it not been for new Labour, he would not be in Committee today talking about objective 1 funding for Wales? Should we not thank the new Labour Government for Wales being on the objective 1 map? Does he accept that his colleague the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) asked my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) not to create too much fuss to get Conway and Denbighshire on that map?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must remind the hon. Lady that I was born and brought up in Denbigh, the very area that will benefit from objective 1 status. Of course, I would not want my own town to be excluded from the objective 1 area. We must ensure that as much of Wales benefits as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was making a cheap party political point. I accept that the Prime Minister secured objective 1 funding for Wales. However, in the first year of that funding, not a single penny of the allocation is in the National Assembly budget for 2000–01. Does anyone wish to challenge me on that? We could lose the whole of that first year's allocation if a decision is not taken before the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the sum was allocated for the six years of the EU budget. That sum remains: if it is not spent now, it will be spent over the six years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite simple. The money must be committed and spent within the first two years, otherwise it is lost. I make a final plea to Government Members, some of whom I would describe as my honourable Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends in the Government may regard our debate as political banter, but the issue under consideration is extemely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The battle is not between new Labour, Welsh Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Deomcrats, but is being fought on behalf of the Welsh people. We must work in partnership to ensure that the money comes to Wales through the comprehensive spending review. We may treat the matter as a joke, but unless the money is allocated in this year's Budget, Wales will be a low-wage sweat economy forever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The time to do that has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are tremendously concerned about the other matters in the Budget. The high value of the pound is having effect on manufacturing, the agricultural and tourist industries and our ability to improve economic performance in Wales. As members of all parties know, economic performance is especially poor in certain parts of Wales. We must deploy objective 1 money and regional policy to improve the ecomomy of west Wales and the valleys. We must make key use of methods at our disposal to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many areas, the high value of the pound is making that job virtually impossible. The Chancellor needs to understand that manufacturing jobs are being lost day by day. Our biggest condemnation of the Budget is that he did not take any steps to reduce that loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend—as I shall call him—describe himself as a member of combative old Plaid Cymru or a member of conservative new Plaid Cymru?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
In relation to jobs in Wales, is the hon. Gentleman aware that, in his constituency, unemployment has fallen by 29 per cent. since 1997, youth unemployment has dropped by 76 per cent., 5,680 pensioners over 75 are entitled to free TV licenses and 14,201 pensioners are entitled to the winter fuel allowance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman passed me his crib sheet, I could check his figures, which have obviously been given to him by the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the high value of the pound is having a serious impact on manufacturing, tourism and agriculture. We must take steps, through the Budget and other instruments, to ensure that the industry becomes far more competitive. Of course, the aid package for farmers was welcome. We argued for months that agrimonetary compensation should be drawn down; indeed, that matter was raised during the Ceredigion by-election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real challenge is making our agricultural industry more competitive in the medium and long term. Short-term palliatives—however welcome—do not address the serious structural problems of that industry. As all Committee members know, the dairy industry is on its knees and the sheep industry and beef sector are facing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State discuss with his Cabinet colleagues how the industry can be restructured so that it has a viable future? Again, a partnership is required between the European Union, Whitehall and the National Assembly to put forward packages to enable farmers to have a sustainable, long-term future. Some of the changes being delivered via Europe require the assistance of matched funding from the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are precious few signs in the Budget that the Chancellor is tackling our underlying concerns. He said that he was being prudent for a purpose, but the benefit of that prudence is not felt in many parts of Wales. In 1999, the Labour party was told that it had to remember its traditional methods and supporters. The by-election won by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion is living proof that it has still not learnt that lesson. Another rude awakening is in store at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the Welsh Grand Committee. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd, I pay tribute to your efforts, Mr. Jones, to seek extra jobs for your constituency and others on the north Wales coast. I wish you well in your future endeavours. I am confident that the Welsh Assembly will find a way to secure jobs in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Chancellor's statement, especially as it affects the national health service. It has been welcomed in Wales, whatever Opposition Members think. Labour Members want to give the people of Wales the facts to show how our constituents have benefited from the Chancellor's statement, as my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd did a moment ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Throughout Wales, people welcomed the extra money provided for the national health service. My hon. Friends and I believe passionately in the NHS, which was born many years ago, when some of us were babes in arms. The Chancellor's announcement, and the progress we have made, is testimony to what we have achieved in three short years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be parochial, but my constituency contains major hospitals that help people in Ynys Môn, Caernarfon, and Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and beyond. The three hospitals are Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, Llandudno hospital and Bryn-Y-Neuadd hospital at Llanfairfechan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my right hon. Friend to use his good offices to take a message from the Committee on two topics about which I am concerned, the first of which is the problem of the corrosion of copper piping at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor. I ask the Minister to take the earliest opportunity to discuss the matter with the First Secretary and the Secretary of State for Health. It was first recognised as a potential problem in 1993, when leaks in the pipework were evident. Since then, staff have closely monitored the situation; recently copper pipe failure because of apparent corrosion has increased, disrupting wards and departments while sections of pipe are replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is very serious indeed. It has been recommended that all the copper pipework at the hospital, which was built during the reign of the Tory Government, should be replaced. I am not an engineer or an architect and it is not for me as a lay person to say that it was a cost-cutting exercise to use copper pipes when the hospital was being built. However, if that proves to be the case, it means that we are paying the price for the previous Administration's mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the Bryn-Y-Neuadd hospital in Llanfairfechan, and I bring to the Committee's attention the situation of residents at that hospital. I call them residents because they are people with learning disabilities and difficulties who live within the grounds of the hospital. Will my right hon. Friend and the Minister use their good offices to discuss the matter with the Health and Social Services Secretary as soon as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bryn-Y-Neuadd was opened in 1971 to serve people with learning disabilities in north Wales. The maximum number of residents was 350. In 1985, the Welsh Office asked health authorities to prepare
	<br><blockquote><p>proposals for the future of the hospitals and units in the years up to 1993/94. The progressive reduction of long-term hospital populations should be an integral part of such proposals.</p></blockquote>
Four years later, words like "comprehensive resettlement" were being used in Welsh Office correspondence. In 1994, the Welsh Office announced that resettlement would be completed by 1 April 1999. The hopes of the Bryn-Y-Neuadd residents and their families were raised but there was no such resettlement. The Welsh Office's objective was reiterated in 1995, but no target date was set. Unfortunately, in December 1996, the Tory Administration said that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
resettlement programme for Bryn-Y-Neuadd would be put on hold. That was a callous, cruel decision for residents and their families.

In the previous Tory Government, the Secretary of State did not represent a Welsh constituency, and nor do the Conservative party's spokesmen, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and the hon. Member for North Dorset. The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), who was the Secretary of State in the Tory Administration, returned to the Treasury some of the money that should have been spent on the health service in Wales.

Resettlement was agreed for Ely hospital, but the following statement was made in respect of Bryn-Y-Neuadd:
	<br><blockquote><p>We have had to conclude that no resources are available to fund any further resettlement.</p></blockquote>
At present, there are 118 residents left at Bryn-Y-Neuadd hospital, none of whom need continuing health care. Those residents should not be institutionalised in a hospital environment: they should live in the community like the rest of us. The residents of Bryn-Y-Neuadd are some of the most socially excluded people in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people who have lived in an institution for a long time are given the opportunity to live in the community, their characters and personalities are transformed. That has been proved time and again. My constituents at Bryn-Y-Neuadd have asked me to help them. They say, "Please do all you can for us. If we are not given an opportunity soon, we shall die here without knowing what it is like to live in a village or a town."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am disappointed at the absence of hon. Members who are eligible to take part. I heard the reasons for that, but the Welsh Grand Committee sits only rarely. I know that this is the first such Committee for the hon. Member for Ceredigion. He may be lucky enough to witness one more before the next general election. Welsh Grands do not take place very month, and it is surely not too onerous for Welsh Members to attend today.

New Labour is struggling with its own identity post-general election. The Institute of Welsh Politics at Aberystwyth university surveyed 1,500 people who voted in last May's Welsh Assembly elections. Its findings suggested that new Labour was seen in Wales as a party that looked after the interests of primarily the middle class and English people. Those questioned felt that the party cared less for the Welsh people and the working classes. We should view the Budget in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Philip Cook, based in Cardiff, said that the Welsh economy is simply not competitive enough and suffers from a lack of entrepreneurship. On its ability to compete commercially, Professor Cook said that Wales was lagging behind very other part of the United Kingdom, except the north-east of England, coming 11th out of 12 regions. He said that Wales was continuing to lose its traditional industries, while making little impact in the new technologies. He believed that the days of attracting huge new investment into Wales were over.

I was interested to hear what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee had to say about the Budget. I am amazed that Labour Members made no mention of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), who made his own criticisms of the Budget when he referred to the Labour Government losing their heartlands—their traditional support throughout the country. We saw that happening in Wales during the Assembly elections, and we saw it again at the Ceredigion by-election. The hon. Member for Walton, a former Minister, accused the Government of strident
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
moralising—rather than listening to the complaints of ordinary people—and of spreading feelings of injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious about listening to the concerns of the Welsh people, they will have to do a lot better than they are now. Listening to the remarks of the Secretary of State and the Labour Members sitting behind him, it is almost as if there were two Budgets—the Budget that the Chancellor spoke about in the House of Commons and the other Budget, which on closer analysis is different from the spin and the gloss put on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to the 1p reduction in tax from this April, but the Government are riding a horse in both directions—a trick more familiar to the Liberal Democrats. The Government are trying to make out that taxes are going down when the opposite is happening. Taxes have been going up by stealth. We heard the great trumpets blowing about the abolition of the TV licence for over-75s. I have campaigned vigorously ever since I became a Member of Parliament for the complete abolition of the TV licence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eighteen years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I personally campaigned for complete abolition. Yes, the over-75s can now look forward to not having to pay for their TV licence, but 390,000 people aged 60 to 75 who live in Wales now face real increases on their TV licences over the next five years. When people receive their 74 to 75p a week increase, it will be seen as a drop in the ocean compared with all the other increases that pensioners face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable that when Lord Falconer was confronted by a pensioner and asked how he would cope on £96 a week, he said that he would have no trouble at all. He should have reflected more on what it must be like living on £96 a week. Nobody in the Committee could imagine that it is easy to do so. It has been a long time since Lord Falconer worried about going out to the shops to buy a bottle of claret or wondered where his next meal was coming from. We must be more caring and more understanding about the plight of pensioners. It is nowadays rather a challenge to live past the age of 75, and we have heard much trumpeting about the extra expenditure on the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am impressed by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather hoping that the Government would announce breaking that link and restoring the link to earnings—but we have not heard that at all. The fact remains—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the hon. Gentleman, if he will listen.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not going to play politics with this matter. We have the interests of pensioners at heart, which is more important than playing politics. It is all very well for Plaid Cymru Members to march proudly through the Lobbies when they know that they will never take the responsibility for picking up the bill. It is easy for them to wear their charity on their sleeves when they will never have to pay for it.

I was talking about trumpeting over the national health service. We welcome the increases in funding: they were certainly necessary. We have seen headlines in the newspapers, saying "Health authority cuts 90 hospital beds in bid to make cash sayings". And what of waiting lists in Wales? On 31 March 1997—when history began—101,000 people in Wales were waiting three months or longer for treatment. By January, 2000, it was 152,000. At the beginning of 1997, 5,956 people were waiting six months; now there are 36,823. The number of people waiting 12 months or more was 67,609 then and is 77,000 now. As to those waiting more than 18 months, there were 1,402 on 31 March 1997 and there are 3,700 today. The national health service in Wales is in crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect for a moment on the Labour Government's £1.3 billion increase in health expenditure over the next few years? He should compare that with what I think was the 1.2 per cent. increase for the health service in Wales when he was parliamentary private secretary to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who was then responsible for health in Wales. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether I have got those figures wrong or whether there was a paltry increase under the Conservative party, while there has been a massive increase under the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These days, we are wary of figures, announcements and reannouncements that come from the Government. They announce that there is new money, but on closer analysis we discover that it is not new. The national health service in Wales has been crying out for extra expenditure. Intensive care units need 50 more beds. The author of a report who is based at Iechyd Morgannwg health authority said that it was vital for the Assembly to consider providing about 50 extra beds to ensure that the population is adequately covered. Another report says that the NHS in Wales is in debt, as we have already heard. The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>The NHS in Wales is facing a debt of £80m and health managers predict the situation will get worse.</p></blockquote>
Much of the new money that has been announced will, therefore, go to pay off the debts that the NHS has built up in Wales. We will be looking carefully to see whether the new money is new and whether it makes an impact on the services that people get.

Another story appeared under the headline "Patient Dies After Hunt For A Bed". It says that, after a serious heart operation, Harold Smith, 74, had to traipse around three hospitals for five hours before he could get into one. He died shortly afterwards. We should remember that, when we talk about statistics, we are talking about the care of ordinary people. These are human stories and, in many cases, human tragedies. It is all right for us, as politicians, to talk glibly about millions of pounds here and millions of pounds there, but if that money does not get through to exactly where it is needed, the people of Wales will be let down. We must rectify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that brief speeches will ensure that everyone catches my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that it is not only a matter of funding. However, with one or two exceptions, everyone in the land has welcomed the additional funding that we have given the health service. The matter is also one of philosophy. The current Conservative philosophy is echoed by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Philosophically we have moved on</p></blockquote>
from the idea of a comprehensive NHS. He has also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Insurance companies should cover operations that are not high tech or expensive, like hip and knee replacements and hernia and cataract operations.</p></blockquote>
In October, he said that
	<br><blockquote><p>people would look to the NHS to provide them with service when they had serious life-threatening conditions, and would look to their private insurance to help them with those things where the NHS had to ask them to wait.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had a go about that earlier. If he cares to read the speech of the leader of my party at the Royal College of Nursing today, he will see that he talks about the priorities that a future Conservative Government will give the national health service to ensure that those who really need care and who have life-threatening conditions will get their operations. I am not talking about the cosmetic operations that were done in the past to ensure that people got through the system. It is not just a problem of waiting lists; what is important is how long people remain on the waiting list. We must ensure that the extra money that was announced in the Budget goes exactly where it is most critically needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in the Secretary of State's speech to refer to two sorts of inflation rate. I hope that he has used his lunchtime at least to consider my comments. The rate related to increases in the tax bands was 1.2 per cent., and the other, we were told, related to motorists and came in at 3.2 per cent. That is an enormous difference. One deals with historical rates of inflation; the other predicts what the inflation rate will be. The difference between the two nationally is £500
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
million. It is a tax increase of £500 million that people did not realise they were facing. The people of Wales are being cheated; their tax rates are going up at one low rate and their fuel rates are going up by a much greater rate. In the St. David's day debate and at previous Welsh Grand Committees, Member's have said that, for people living in rural areas, vehicles are not a luxury, but a necessity, but yet again they are clobbered by these increases in the motoring taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is all about the burden of taxation. My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset pointed out that the burden of taxation had risen from 35.3 per cent., to 37.8 per cent. Another £1.4 billion of tax increases have been announced. A typical family in Wales has £670 more tax to pay. There is also the great stealth tax of the council tax, which I do not recall Labour Members talking about. On average, council taxes are increasing by more than 10 per cent. in Wales, which is much higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Some of the increases are quite remarkable. In Swansea it is 13.7 per cent.; in Ynys Môn, for band D, it is 16 per cent. In Cardiff and Torfaen it is 10.5 per cent. In Powys it is 13.8 per cent. We are talking of rates of inflation at two and a bit per cent.: yet the people of Wales are facing a council tax increase that is five times the rate of inflation. That needs full investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Cardiff, one might argue that the Russell Goodway rate of inflation is even higher. I gave the Minister an opportunity to condemn the £58,000 that Russell Goodway was taking for his salary. The Minister appeared to want just to shrug it off and allow the Welsh Assembly to have its say without expressing any opinion of his own. Whenever I hear the people of Cardiff speak about this they are rightly appalled that the Labour leader of Cardiff council is taking such an increase. It is a great shame that today, when the Welsh Assembly could have taken action against him they failed to do so. The Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly will move again to ensure that his salary is cut right back. We have all heard about snouts in the trough, but what a snout and what a trough. He has a duty to listen carefully to the people of Cardiff. I hope that, with all the reorganisation that is going on in local government in Wales, the Government pay heed to Russell Goodway's comment that he is just the beginning and that all the other local authorities in Wales will follow suit. The people of Wales will not stand for those objectionable salary increases.

We heard a lot about it being a Budget for business. Was it? Chris Humphries, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Businesses have learnt not to be fooled by Chancellors' headline announcements, but to await the small print before casting final judgement on the Budget … Gordon Brown has not done enough to ease the increasing tax and administrative burden on business.</p></blockquote>
Digby Jones, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry said:
	<br><blockquote><p>This is not the budget for business that we were hoping for.</p></blockquote>
The Federation of Small Businesses said:
	<br><blockquote><p>We had called for a war on red tape but the Chancellor has ignored this completely. The working families tax credit due to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
start in April 2000, will seriously impact upon the smallest employers. We are also dismayed that the Chancellor did not take the opportunity to climb down on IR35.</p></blockquote>
Goldman Sachs said:
	<br><blockquote><p>In our view, the Budget has materially increased the risk of an interest rate rise in the coming weeks. We also have some nagging doubts about the prudence of this budget.</p></blockquote>
I could give more examples of businesses that feel let down by the Budget. We must pay due regard to what those representatives of the business community are saying.

I welcome the loan that was given to ensure that the Airbus project could go ahead. I join Labour Members in calling on the Welsh Assembly to ensure that its contribution is forthcoming so that we can secure the jobs in north Wales for the Airbus project.

Farming has been mentioned. I welcome the statement that was made only last week, but it is a great shame that neither the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food nor the Prime Minister could not come to the Dispatch Box to make it. We are looking at the worst crisis that farming has faced in more than 60 years. I went to the Ceredigion by-election and saw the calf being shot. That is happening daily on farms up and down the country, and it is harrowing to see. Incomes have dropped by 25 per cent. which is dramatic and comes on top of a drop of 50 per cent. Farm gate prices are dropping dramatically, and the price of milk is expected to drop yet again. Farmers are in a serious crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor did not mention some of the other taxes that are coming into effect now, such as the disappearance of the married couple's allowance, mortgage tax relief and the national insurance rate for the self-employed and those earning over £27,000. The stamp duty increase will hit those who are selling their farms and there are increases in tobacco, beer and wine. The climate levy could hit agriculture. The National Farmers Union has estimated that such taxes could cost farming £26 million. Overall taxes on business have increased by £13 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with his right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) who said:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Governments have in the past followed a policy of reducing the percentage of take, which has increased dramatically under this Government, at a time when the economy is growing to secure increases on the essential services such as the NHS, law and order and education.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should stop the spin doctoring and look at the money that could be spent on education, the NHS and law and order. When I was with David Hunt in the Welsh Office he had one special adviser. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>

The total cost of bureaucracy throughout the United Kingdom has risen by £1 billion since 1997. That is the sort of money that could go into direct services. When people ask whether we are getting more for the extra money that is being spent, time and again the answer is no. We have seen it with the Assembly building farce. At least the First Secretary has had the guts to put that project on hold. I hope that he will have the guts to bring it to a complete stop. To spend £26 million on a new Assembly building when the current building is quite adequate is an insult to the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to tell him. It has been fully costed. The Welsh Assembly Members, the Scottish Parliament Members and the current London farce all cost money. We have a Scottish Parliament building that started at between £10 million and £40 million and now costs £240 million. When we fought the referendum in Wales, the building for the Assembly was to cost between £12 million and £17 million; it is now between £26 million and £30 million.

I do not want the Liberal Democrats to feel left out. We heard from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) this morning when he was doing his part of the job share. He talked about how much extra the pensioners ought to be taking. He came up with a figure of over £2 a week on top of all the other benefits that are being paid, such as winter fuel benefits and TV licences. He went through all the services and said that they all deserved to receive more money, yet he did not say from where the extra money would come, apart from alluding to an increase of 1p in income tax. I tried to work out where that idea came from and it dawned on me that such economics from the Bible from which we learned that 5,000 people were fed with five loaves and two fishes, and food was still left over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats are basing their economic policy on that story along the lines of, "If they did it then, it can be done now." They will not be given the opportunity to put in place the economics of the madhouse. Indeed, most of their policies rely on ditching the pound and going into the euro as quickly as possible, irrespective of the wishes of the people of Wales, three quarters of whom in poll after poll say that they would not touch the euro with a barge pole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the great spate of figures delivered by the hon.

He was asked to elaborate, but the only figures that he gave were those relating to salaries at the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. If he were to get rid of the £1 billion of bureaucracy, would be also get rid of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly?

His constituents would not say to him that, because of the changes that have taken place since 1997 and the extra bureaucracy, they are receiving better services. At the general election, the people of Wales were told that Wales deserves better. After three years of a Labour Government, given the decline in manufacturing, the crisis in the national health service, the increase in crime and farming being in its worse state for 60 years, Wales still deserved better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members for Ribble Valley and for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones), but I think that the Budget was outstanding for Wales and the British ecomomy. The high spot was the extra resources planned for the health service: £2 billion this year and, over the next four years, a steady growth of 6.1 per cent. in real terms in expenditure on the health service. That money is needed desperately and it is our responsibility to ensure that we receive value for that money and that a much better health service is delivered to our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extra £1 billion will be spent on schools. Wales will receive £50 million for school buildings, books and equipment. A total of £4 billion has been injected into the economy. I am especially pleased with the increase in the working families tax credit, which includes £4.25 extra per child. The heating allowance for pensioners has been increased from £100 to £150. I know that much more has to be done for pensioners, but something substantial is done for them, piece by piece, in every Budget or November statement. I hope that, later this year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will find the money to pay for the nursing care provided by nursing homes. That care should be part of the NHS, as those costs weigh heavily on many pensioner households.

I noticed from today's contributions that Opposition Members find it very difficult to be cheerful and pleased about what has happened. Indeed, their response is grudging. I noted especially Plaid Cymru's party political broadcast two days after the Budget in which

the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy had five minutes to elaborate on its reaction. That broadcast was appalling and completely out of tune with the views that have been expressed to me; it was grudging, mean minded and totally un Welsh in character.

My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has the economy well under control and in his grasp. We have produced stability and an end to boom and bust. Steady economic growth of 3 per cent. this year and 2.5 to 3 per cent. in the following three years is expected. That will create the framework in which business can make plans and we can plan future public expenditure. I was especially interested in the parts of the Budget statement in which the Chancellor looked ahead and referred to how we have converted our inheritance—a deficit of £28 billion. That huge albatross in our first two years in government meant that we could not do all that we wanted because we first had to pull ourselves out of the red. We have pulled ourselves out of the red and are now in surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Budget statement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>After the measures I announce today, our projection is for a current surplus next year of £14 billion and for the years after that surpluses of plus 16, plus 13, plus 7 and plus 8.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 860.]</p></blockquote>
Our policies will produce surpluses for five years. The result of prudence in our first two years in government is steady growth in the economy. While in surplus, we are paying off the national debt. On the basis of those plans, the debt-to-GDP ratio will decrease from 44 to 33 per cent. in three years' time. We are not only living within our means, but paying off that expensive debt, which doubled between 1992 and 1997, under the previous Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Môn painted a deeply depressing, self-selecting picture, but the backdrop to the Welsh economy is one of low inflation, low interest rates and low unemployment. In my constituency, the number of unemployed people has decreased from more than 2,000 four years ago, to 1,171, according to the latest figures. The unemployment rate has decreased from 6.7 to 4.1 per cent., and it is falling. I am pleased for my constituents because that percentage is below the Welsh and British averages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our greatest achievement for the future of the Welsh economy has been gaining objective 1 status, which has involved much hard work. My right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) and the staff of the Welsh Office did an enormous amount of preparatory work. During the European summit, my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Prime Minister ensured that west Wales and the valleys will receive special additional help because of the appalling state in which those areas were left after 18 years of Conservative rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matching funds will be announced in July. For the next six years, west Wales and the valleys will benefit not only from British economic growth but a second helping of economic growth—not 2.5 per cent. or 3 per cent. a year, but 3 per cent., 4 per cent. or 5 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
cent. a year. If local authorities, the Welsh Development Agency and the Welsh Assembly work together in partnership—I liked that word from the hon. Member for Ynys Môn, although I felt that his contribution was extremely confrontational—along with Members of Parliament, councillors and area forums, west Wales and the valleys should benefit from growth of 3 per cent., 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. every year for the next six or seven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we want finance from the Welsh Development Agency, which provides wonderful links, and from local authorities. We also want private-public partnerships, which may provide part of the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been dutifully on-message so far, I want to agree with some of the comments made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. The strong pound is a problem; a problem of success. International money has so much confidence in the British economy that money flows relentlessly into Britain, away from the euro, the yen and the south-east Asian economies. That is a problem for farmers and the manufacturing industry. Rover is the best known case of the past two or three weeks, and could have a knock-on effect in Wales. Llanwern steelworks is another example, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, as is the automotive components industry generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bank of England is responsible for interest rates, and has kept inflation well under control. That is its No. 1 priority—2.5 per cent. inflation, plus or minus 1 per cent. It has been a little over-prudent. In the past 11 months, inflation has been less than 2.5 per cent. every month. The Bank of England has erred on the side of caution in cutting rates by 0.25 per cent. Even if inflation were to drift to 2.5 per cent., 2.6 per cent. or 2.7 per cent., it would still be well within target and would help to put negative pressure on the value of the pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) said, it is not only a problem of a strong pound but of a weak euro. When the euro was launched, everyone expected the deutschmark to be a strong currency. Surprisingly, and for complicated reasons, the world market devalued it by 15 to 20 per cent., which is a real problem. I hope that, as the euro economies pick up—they are currently enjoying 3 per cent. growth—the euro will re-establish itself and be self-correcting. If the European central bank increases interest rates this week or next week, I hope that we will not have to follow. If the differential is allowed to erode, the euro will strengthen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European central bank and the Bank of England have considered intervention separately in the past three or four months. Perhaps they should get together, and perhaps involve the Group of Seven or the United States in a discussion about intervention. The dollar is suffering from the huge payment deficit in the United States. Britain is also drifting towards
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
deficit, while in Europe there are massive balance of payment surpluses. I share the view with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru that in the long term—in five years or thereabouts—we need a strong enough euro. It would help manufacturing industry and farming, and it would help to bring prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard from the incredible Welsh Labour party, from the incredible party of Wales and from the party of North Dorset and Ribble Valley. It is time to hear from the historic party of Wales, the inventors of devolution—the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the absence of co-operative politics. The irony was that the person who was most confrontational was the one who spends the most time in the Assembly. We do not have to be psychologists to know that if we act in an aggressive way, people act aggressively back. It is rare for co-operative politics to evolve when either side is shouting. Lessons should be learned from today's performances. Once again, it falls to the Liberal Democrats, as peacemakers, to provide an objective, cool and perhaps conclusive series of observations on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, my absence this morning is explained by the fact that I was looking for the hon. Member for Ribble Valley. Not finding him anywhere, I cam here, and he was not here either. Perhaps he was avoiding me, lest I remind him that when it comes to horses, the Conservative horse is definitely riding through Budget cloud cuckoo land, where public expenditure can be increased while taxes are reduced. Indeed, the Conservatives probably plan to pay for the promises in their next manifesto by entering their Budget for the Booker prize for creativity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prudence that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley promised by implication is something to behold, and I seriously hope that he will write to me to explain how the Conservatives arrive at the figure of an additional £1 billion for bureaucracy. Much as I would like to criticise the Government for bureaucracy at times, I just do not believe that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal with the key points and try not to repeat what has been said. In my judgment, uncertainty is one of the biggest problems, certainly in the Welsh rural economy. Mid-Wales is used to being poor, despite many efforts to raise wage levels. Even now, an economic sword of Damocles hangs over farming and many other industries, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not right hon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other industries are also affected, some of which are related to the problems of Longbridge. In my constituency, that includes BSK and Stadco. That uncertainty makes it difficult to create stability among a work force who would otherwise be tempted to migrate out of the area, thereby shifting the demographic profile up in age terms and causing further problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
There are other on-going problems. Laura Ashley maintains a certain uncertainty in its dealings on account of the company's long-standing desire to sell at least a couple of its plants. Other companies have gone to the wall, such as Montgomery Thermostats. In that context, I wanted support from the Budget for the areas with those problems, which are not restricted to mid-Wales. The Budget has some good measures and could not be roundly condemned as a failure. However, it could have been even better on health. We secured an important, precedent setting deal with the former Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), whereby we agreed to make cuts in Powys, as long as we were allowed to keep our hospitals. I think that we did that quite well. I am glad that more money is coming into health in Wales. However, as the hon. Member for Ynys Môn said, that money goes some way towards clearing the debt, without necessarily relieving that much of the pressure, so we wait to see what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the £200 million promised to farmers. Unfortunately, it was not in the Budget, so it was a tactical solution to a strategic problem. It would have been much better if that money had been built into the Budget to provide a long-term solution, or at least the confidence that it was considered at the Budget stage. I am not being churlish about that money, which was most welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other details have already been mentioned, such as the council tax damper. That damper has been in existence for some time but, in the past, has been picked up by the Government. It is a shame that the Government do not intend to support it again, as poor areas are now subbing areas that are even poorer. That is not the right way to do business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The squeeze has created spin-off problems. The reorganisation of the Arts Council threatened Theatre Powys and other theatrical organisations, which are rather small budget areas, but are squeezed as a result of the desperation to put money back into the central pot. Public transport has been mentioned. People in the country pay a huge premium of £3 or £4 a tankful on fuel that they need to get around in what is often the most efficient way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the changes that we would have liked to see. The Budget was a chance to share a long-term strategy for health, and it is in the Secretary of State's power to provide useful guidance to the health service so that it can plan for the long term. He may wish to consider the Powys model for creating partnerhsips with local service users and providers, as a result of which people buy into the need to be prudent, without being profligate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should invest still more in education. The Secretary of State may wish to consider what to do about Welsh-medium education, which is still underfunded and patchy in delivery. The same holds for transport. I had the pleasure of visiting your constituency only last week, Mr. Jones. You will be glad to know that your constituents miss you when you are not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is always there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Getting to your constituency is rather difficult, Mr. Jones, because of poor north-south road links. The east-west link is also poor: mid-Wales is bereft of a proper connection between England and the constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion. A serious investigation could be made into what we could do in the medium term to semi-dual the road. A dual carriageway would not be required all the way through, but installing two-mile sections of such a road would speed up travel massively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trains could do with further investment, and budgetary expenditure promised for transport could be used for that. That would help the hon. Member for Ceredigion and me to co-operate all the way from my constituency to London, and would also help people to pass through my constituency more quickly. That would be greatly welcomed by my activists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already spoken about farming. Pensioners have had small benefits from the Budget. However, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley said, they needed a little bit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, there are good things in the Budget, but it is not so good that it is perfect. This is a good time to put to the test the meaning of the word "co-operation". If this Committee is to be effective and worth while, I hope that ideas and proposals about the Ministers' work will originate from both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We forget that we are lucky in this country. For all our problems and arguments about the detail of the Budget, in a global context we are a wealthy nation. With a little generosity of spirit, I am sure that we can make things better for almost everyone and almost all communities in Wales and the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Budget is a triumph for the Labour Government, and shows how sound and prudent my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has been in his management of the economy. After three years of a Labour Government, we are on a sound, firm basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly talk about health, say how good the Budget is for women and quickly tackle the level of the pound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health is tremendously important, and much has been said about it today. My constituency contains the University Hospital of Wales and Velindre and Whitchurch hospitals, so health is of great significance to me. Yesterday, I helped to launch the new Cardiff and Vale trust, which is a giant trust covering all the services in the Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. It has a budget deficit and it is likely that some of the money being given to the health service is likely to go towards it. However, I hope that a lot of the money will go towards bringing down waiting times for hip
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
replacements and cardiac surgery. I urge the Welsh Assembly to do that when it decides how to spend that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way of tackling such lists is for consultants to work full-time in the health service. We should redesign consultants' contracts so that they cannot practice privately, but have to concentrate completely on the health service. That would reduce the lists quickly. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State would pursue that in his discussions with the Assembly. Taking the health expenditure in advance of the comprehensive spending review clearly shows the Government's commitment to the health service, and I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is good for women, including women in Wales. We have not tackled that subject at all today, and I wish that I had longer to do it. The VAT cut on sanitary products is a good move and is the result of a campaign by women Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the men supported us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Department of Trade and Industry's review of maternity pay and support for parental leave. Parental leave should be paid. In other countries in which it has been introduced, it is not taken up—especially by men—unless it is paid. I urge my right hon. Friend to work with us to ensure that parental leave is paid. I believe that the Government are sympathetic to the issue and that this is another campaign in which we may succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget addresses many issues affecting women. Yesterday, the Welsh Affairs Committee was in Cardiff, where we met men and women from black and ethnic minority groups. We were enormously concerned to be told about the isolation and discrimination suffered, especially by black women, in some Welsh cities. I hope that some of the resources in the Budget will be used to address such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of the pound, is causing many problems in manufacturing industry, for which there is no magic solution. It is important that we recognise that areas such as Wales are affected disproportionately by the level of the pound in relation to the euro, and we must address that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency yesterday, Aeroquip, which makes car components in Llanishen, announced that it will close at the end of the year with the loss of 140 jobs. The plant has been in Cardiff for 30 years, so there is a great deal of concern about the closure. The work force of Inviscosuisse, a textile operating company, which has been in Cardiff since 1947, has fallen from 150 to 60. Five of its customers in the Leicester area closed last week and its traditional export market in Holland is falling through. Inviscosuisse has therefore asked me to say that the level of pound in relation to the euro is causing many problems in the manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Budget is tremendous, giving us in Wales a great deal of opportunity to prioritise our concerns about health, education and the economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) for her generosity in curtailing her speech. I rise to speak for cuddly middle-aged Welsh Labour with an English accent. I had intended to talk about how wonderful the Budget was in many aspects, but I shall concentrate on just one because of the limitation on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is prudent, but principled, and I want to focus on the environmental principle that underlies many parts of it. We summarise it with the phrase "the polluter pays". However, that principle also means that we seek to support environmental goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the introduction of the new reduced VAT rate for the installation of energy-saving materials in all homes and the extension of reduced vehicle excise duty to cars up to 1,200 cc, a concession that will benefit many small energy-efficient cars. In tandem with that, we have the introduction of a graduated system for vehicle excise duty and four categories based on carbon dioxide emissions. That is an excellent example of thinking globally and acting nationally. At the same time, we have the reform of company car tax to encourage the use of lower-emission vehicles. More money is going towards modernising public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could mention several other things, including some that will happen in the near future and which relate to building on brownfield sites, dealing with pesticides and further encouraging new technology low-emission vehicles. However, I want to draw the Committee's attention to something that no other hon. Member has mentioned: the introduction of the aggregates levy from April 2002. I want to celebrate the fact that it will apply not only to quarrying but will be levied for every tonne of sand or aggregate that is taken from British waters. That is especially significant for those of us in south Wales and, specifically, for my constituency. Ever since I have lived in the Swansea area, there has been a debate about the loss of sand from the various beaches on the Gower peninsula. In particular, there has been a dispute about whether natural tidal processes are simply shifting the sands from area to area in the sea, on to the shore and off again, or whether dredging for sand extraction at various locations in the Bristol channel is an underlying cause. Whenever the dredging companies put in for new licences or extensions of licences, they produce a consultant's report to show that sand disappearing from the beaches is the result of natural processes and has nothing to do with sand removal from whichever sandbank they happen to be interested in at the time. Weighted against those reports is a certain amount of academic evidence. As it is unsponsored, it should perhaps carry more weight. It has been honest in acknowledging how little we know about what happens in the waters that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might think that the precautionary principle would have applied in those circumstances, but, sadly, it did not. That was partly because of the old jobs-versus-the-environment dichotomy. Furthermore, the Crown Estates and the Welsh Office were loath to resist applications without evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is currently an application to extend the Llanelli Sand Dredging Company's licence to extract a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
further 300,000 tonnes from Hellwick bank, which is a sandbank not far from Worms Head at Rhosilli at the western end of the Gower peninsula. That application has still not been decided. My constituents are united in opposing it, although many are cynical, based on their experience of previous bids. For my part, I hope and believe that their cynicism is unjustified this time, partly because times have changed and environmental concerns have climbed up the agenda. More importantly, the Bristol channel marine aggregates study that was commissioned jointly by the old Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment tells a different story from that offered by the dredgers' consultants. It shows that the sand sediments in Camarthen bay are in a state of dynamic equilibrium and that there is an onshore and offshore exchange of sediments between east Hellwick and beaches along the Gower peninsula. In other words, if we take sand from Hellwick, we are taking it from the beaches of Gower. There is not only an environmental impact; the beaches of Gower are also a tourist attraction, and there is an economic dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to win the battle in Gower, but the problem is not only in Gower. There are nine dredging areas in the Bristol channel; 13 licences are in force which would allow the extraction of nearly 5 million tonnes a year if they were fully exploited. Most extraction is near the south Wales coast, where there are many examples of beach erosion. In future, when we consider dredging, we must take more account of the consequences of exploiting the marine environment. More research into the subject is needed; the construction industry should be encouraged to use recycled and secondary aggregates rather than the produce of dredging or quarrying, which have environmental consequences. The new aggregates levy will be good news for the environment in areas susceptible to quarrying; it is particularly good news for the south Wales coastline and its beaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to commend the Budget's key principles in respect of child poverty. The most effective anti-poverty measures in an economy are falling unemployment and economic growth, which the Government have achieved. There has been a greater reduction in unemployment than many of us anticipated two or three years ago. People would not have believed us if we had told them on the doorsteps in our constituencies before the general election that inflation would fall to 1.2 per cent. and that interest rates would be at a record low, but that is what the Government have achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To their credit, the Government introduced the national minimum wage. Some of us thought that it could have been higher, but the evidence taken in parts of Wales by the Welsh Affairs Committee's inquiry into social exclusion showed that the national minimum wage has made a significant difference in the labour market. People previously earning £2.50 or £2.60 an hour are now earning a minimum of £3.60 or £3.70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child benefit system was withering on the vine under the previous Tory Government, because they lacked commitment to the measure. This Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
have increased child benefit to a record level; it is one of the most important measures for attacking child poverty because of its universal nature. It will be the equivalent of £60 a month for the first child, which will make a significant difference to many families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley did not realise that the working families tax credit, which was opposed by the Conservative party, had been introduced. It will be some time before the significance of such an important measure is recognised. Child tax credit will be introduced later this year. He is not here at present, but he may remember that the previous Conservative Government started to phase out the married couples tax allowance; it is not an invention of this Government. I entirely support the child tax credit because it is important to redistribute resources from those who do not have dependent children to those who do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still much social exclusion in Wales. Last week, with other members of the Welsh Affairs Committee, I visited Llwynu school in Abergavenny in my constituency and heard a story of deprivation that astounded many of us. As the Committee heard earlier, the head teacher spent a third of her time on child protection and kept a store of clothing for children who were inadequately clothed. I do not want to stigmatise the school and the community but we should be aware that there is social deprivation everywhere. Monmouthshire is perceived as an affluent area, so it receives lower local government funding; the people in the Llwynu estate are therefore doubly disadvantaged. They suffer the material disadvantages of unemployment and single parenthood, and disadvantages because the local authority does not have adequate resources to enable it to respond to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will appreciate my constituents' anxieties and work with his colleagues in the Assembly for a better funding formula for local government throughout Wales. The formula should take account of social deprivation and the rural nature of many constituencies and introduce a redistributive system to help the more deprived areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Some hon. Members said earlier that we should rejoice about the Budget; we were told that it was a triumph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government asked us to "rejoice, rejoice" and my hon. Friends and I would not want to do that. However, on reflection, I believe that this is probably the least bad Budget for 20 years. It has some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
noticeable achievements, but it also has noticeable holes. It is a bit like the proverbial Polo mint; the great big hole in the middle is objective 1. If objective 1 had been matched by additionality and been included in the Budget, rather than being battened on to the comprehensive spending review, it could have been said to be a good Budget, but least bad will have to do for now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget shows the Opposition how new Labour, or Welsh Labour—whatever badge it wants to wear—will treat public expenditure and the unemployed, what its priorities are and how the economy of Wales will develop under this Government. The Budget fundamentally ignores the crisis in rural Wales and has failed to come up with the goods on objective 1. The problem is the Government's great philosophy that they are governing for one nation. I accept that is the sense of Britishness that the Prime Minister talks about, but in economic terms we are not one nation. The hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) spoke of the disproportionate effect of the strong pound on the Welsh economy; I think that the Budget should have done more to tackle the needs of different parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Mön and other hon. Members want to debate objective 1 in detail. Today, the regional aid alliance, with the support of the Coalfield Communities Campaign, lobbied the House of Commons. They put forcibly their anxieties about objective 1. They were worried because things are running behind in Wales and projects will not start until September because of new Labour's self-fulfilling prophecy: the money was not in place for the first year, therefore applications could not be made for subsequent years. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Ynys Mön said, we must get started on objective 1. If we are running behind for two or three years, the money will be lost. The lobby of Parliament was important because it included representatives of the English regions who share our views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Sending back £20 million caused great bitterness. However, if there is no additionality and the Government do not provide match funding, that is what will happen to the Welsh block. Money will be sent back to the Treasury under the Fontainebleau agreement. Matters need to be rationalised and settled.

Plaid Cymru feels strongly about the crisis in the farming industry, especially in the dairy sector. The hon. Members for Brecon and Radnor, for Ribble
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Valley, and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) and my hon. Friend the Member for Yns Mön mentioned the farming crisis, as did the Secretary of State in his opening remarks. The announcement of the agrimoney settlement at the summit was welcome, but it was received with surprise by Members of the Assembly, who had not realised that an announcement would be made here today, and in fact thought that they would be making it themselves. I hope that in the winding-up speeches we will hear whether there was consultation on that announcement.

The £66 million on the UK level represents a fraction, of the £454 million that is available in the agri-monetary compensation scheme. A little more could have been done, and more will certainly need to be done next year. The real problem with the Budget as regards farming—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Betty Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. Labour Members are perplexed about what the hon. Member for Ceredigion is referring to when he talks of announcements. Could he elaborate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State gave a breakdown of the amounts available for the different sectors under the agri-monetary compensation scheme. That announcement was made in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire rightly said, there was nothing in the Budget statement or the Red Book that strategically addressed the long-term problems in agriculture. We are told that we need diversification and that that is the way in which agriculture must move. If that is the case, the Government must give some idea of how that could be developed and supported by their fiscal policy. I hope that that will happen, because we all accept that agri-monetary compensation is a short-term solution and that there should be long-term planning. Twenty-two thousand people are employed in farming in Wales. When we compare that figure with the number employed in manufacturing, we may think it time there was a task force to examine the future of farming throughout the United Kingdom. Perhaps that conclusion will come out of the summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional venture capital is a particular problem in the Budget. We were told that there would be an extra £1 billion throughout the United Kingdom; in fact, when we study the figures in detail, it turns out that only £100 million is new money. It is a case of smoke and mirrors once again, with announcements being made about new money of which there is in fact very little. That figure means that there is only £5 million for Wales. Edwina Hart, the Finance Secretary in the Assembly, said that DTI money was simply being moved about. Wales has 50 per cent. or less of the early-stage venture capital compared with the figure for the United Kingdom as a whole. That is a crucial issue in rural areas in which we have high self-employment, many small businesses, and a need to get e-commerce moving. Those areas need that venture capital funding.

Micropharm, a company in my constituency, is involved in the pharmaceutical production of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
antibodies. The company uses sheep—I hasten to add that this does not involve animal experimentation; it is a perfectly natural process, similar to the injections that produce antibodies. That venture has been a successful job creator in rural areas, and a creator of well-paid jobs in my constituency. The spin-offs from that venture continue, but it needs infrastructure help. The Welsh Development Agency does not seem to understand the project, and the local authority cannot help. It is an ideal target for the venture capital funds that were mentioned in the Budget statement, but with only £5 million for Wales I doubt that it will get much out of the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) spoilt my next piece, because I was about to say that nobody had mentioned the environment and to castigate people for not doing so. I welcome not so much his English accent as his green accent, and how he has expressed himself today. I am sure that in the end he will go from being cuddly to coochy on green matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The positive measures in the Budget should of course be welcomed, but there was no cut in VAT on energy-saving materials, there was a cut in VAT on installations, but not on the materials themselves—DIY installations, for example, will not save on VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the positive side, the climate change levy was introduced, which was a welcome step towards our Kyoto targets. It was not mentioned in either the Budget debate or our debate today, but it is important to emphasise that the levy is intended to be neutral on industry, including service industries, by dint of the reduction in employers' national insurance payments. That is a welcome measure of the Government's green commitments. The Government need to examine next how the climate change levy and the related non-fossil fuel obligation combine in Wales. At present there is an over-reliance on wind energy in Wales, as I am sure that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) agrees. Wales has one third of all the wind farms in the United Kingdom, which for us is saturation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now asking ourselves what new ideas there are for mid-Wales. Finland, for example, has produced some good ideas—including paternity leave and so on. That country has developed biomass and has become world leader in biomass energy in 15 years. But we need diversification into alternative energy sources. We are happy to see wind energy in mid-Wales, but unhappy that there is no diversification into alternative energy sources elsewhere in Wales and the United Kingdom. Wales could make a sustainable contribution to United Kingdom targets for job creation, environmental improvement and social development with hydroelectricity, tidal power and biomass. The latter in particular can bring about great environmental improvements. I too welcome aggregates. Time does not permit me to say more about the subject but I support the comments of the hon. Member for Gower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national health service settlement has rightly received strong support. We welcome the important step that the Government has taken. Of course the 6.1 per cent. increase at United Kingdom level translates to 5.6 per cent. for Wales, but the Assembly has made that good. That is fair enough, and I point out that disparity
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
in the light of our earlier debate. That is convergence at work. If hon. Members had any doubts about convergence, they now have an example of it. The United Kingdom level of 6.1 per cent. works out at 5.6 per cent. for Wales because we begin at a slightly higher point and the Barnett formula works along the lines of convergence. An independent review of the Barnett formula and what it delivers for Wales is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I was asked by the media whether I thought that there was any point in having a Welsh Grand Committee. Given the debate that we have had, I see the point of it. However, I hope that it will develop along the lines outlined by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and take on a pre-legislative role as well as a discursive role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting. I begin with the question of identity. For the benefit of all hon. Members, may I point that we on this side are Welsh Labour Members of Parliament? We represent rural and urban Wales, city Wales and valley Wales. We support the Government in this British Parliament and we are working in partnership with Labour Members of the National Assembly to deliver. The Budget was about delivery, in terms of both the National Assembly and Labour Members supporting it and voting for the Budget—something that not every member of the Committee did—to deliver the increases to the National Assembly to support Labour delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although agriculture is slightly outside the Budget settlement, it has been raised today so I will say something about it. The figures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issued supported figures that I sent to all members of the Committee following my attendance at the agriculture summit last Thursday. They were indicative figures to assess the settlement that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced last week. They were intended as an approximate idea of how the agriculture compensation settlement and spending would pan out. I anticipated that approximately £10.8 million would be available directly to Welsh farmers by way of agri-money compensation. The National Assembly will have an allocation of £15 million which it in turn may allocate according to its own priorities. Those announcements will be made by the National Assembly in due course. I hope that the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for Montgomeryshire and other hon. Members will welcome that investment by the Government in the agricultural sector and the rural economy at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget debate has shown how, through strong management of the economy, the Government, working with the National Assembly, have been able to deliver social progress on a range of issues. Legitimate points have been raised by hon. Members on all sides of the Committee. I heard the hon. Member for Ynys Mön, but, in partnership with the Assembly, we can deliver real social improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) referred to the strong
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
economy created by the Chancellor, which has enabled us to pay some of the debts left by the Conservative Government when we took office, and to provide real tax cuts so that more money can be put back into Welsh people's pockets. It has also encouraged greater investment throughout Wales and produced low inflation, which has allowed the Government to achieve their manifesto objective of proper investment in public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want stronger businesses in Wales, and the Chancellor's management of the economy has provided genuine tax cuts to support them. The reduction of capital gains tax from 40 to 35 per cent., the extension of the 14 per cent. first-year capital allowances and other measures will benefit 29,000 small and medium firms in Wales. The strong economy is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would deny that there are some difficult problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North and others mentioned the strength of the pound. The Government recognise that the pound is strong and that it affects our interests within Europe. Since 1 May, sterling has risen by about 15 per cent. against the euro. Conversely, it has fallen by 2.5 per cent. against the dollar. The hon. Member for North Dorset mentioned Rover, another important issue. I know that my right hon. Friend takes that matter seriously and is in discussions with the First Secretary about it. We shall also be working with the Welsh Automotive Forum to examine the impact of Rover's difficulties on Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strong Budget and the strong economy brought about by the Chancellor will enable us to rebuild public services. My hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Clwyd, for Conwy, for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire all mentioned the health service. We have given a massive boost to the NHS in Wales: let us make no mistake about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with incredulity to the hon. Members for North Dorset and for Ribble Valley, who sat through 18 years of a Conservative Government who grossly underfunded the national health service. When the hon. Member for Ribble Valley was the parliamentary private secretary to the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, there was an increase in health expenditure of only 1.2 per cent. We are now providing £1.3 billion of expenditure on the NHS over the next four years—a substantial 5.6 per cent. increase, which brings us up to European levels and provides the opportunity for short and long-term investment in the NHS locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy made valuable points about the NHS and local hospital problems in her constituency, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley dealt with modernisation. These are all important issues, on which I shall reflect furher with colleagues in the National Assembly. The Government's commitment to the NHS is paramount, which means tackling health inequalities in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to break the consensus in Committee, but we go into the election facing a Conservative party—
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
including the hon. Members for North Dorset and for Ribble Valley—advocating a tax guarantee, which will result in potential cuts in real public expenditure. That will not bear comparison with a party that has delivered on the national health service and is strongly associated with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd mentioned education. The Budget offers opportunities for the National Assembly to tackle long-term education issues. I should tell the hon. Member for North Dorset that according to the assessments made by the National Assembly, some of the money will go directly to schools, some to local authorities to help with capital projects and some will be spent in other ways to support education. However, all the money will go on real improvements in education in our communities. Once again, I must tell the Conservative party that that resource would not have been there had it not been for the Chancellor's Budget. The Budget means that there will be real improvements. When we talk about the National Assembly bringing forward £49.5 million thanks to the Labour Government and to their partnership with the Assembly, we are talking about real improvements in people's lives. That means that capital money will be spent on school buildings and that money will be spent at the chalk face. It means that the Budget has delivered partnership to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On employment and fairness, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his introductory comments—and many hon. Members have echoed him—that the Budget has helped to support the working families tax credit and pensions and to put more money into the new deal and employment opportunities. I should tell the hon. Members for Ceredigion, for Brecon and Radnorshire, for Montgomeryshire and for Ynys Mön and others who have mentioned rural areas that the British Government are pumping those British Government resources into those areas of our community: people in our rural communities benefit from the working families tax credit, pension rises and the resources that the Government make available. I should also tell them that those British Government resources are helping to support people in Wales. The only really contrary speech that I have heard today was that by the hon. Member for Ynys Mön, who misjudged the whole tenor of the debate. That is perhaps because people lose track of how things feel in the House when they come here only every six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that we are defending middle England in the Budget, but I know from my constituency that middle England is as important to the Government as working-class England, working-class Wales and middle Wales. The Budget is about supporting all people in Wales and delivering real health improvements and real support to a range of individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
tired, as I am sure all Labour Members are, of the negative attitude of Plaid Cymru Members towards objective 1. Proposals were delivered by my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the hon. Gentleman and every other member of the Committee knows the process that the Government are following. I invite hon. Members who are critical of that position to consider what the Government do when the comprehensive spending review is complete. Let us judge how the Government perform then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have spoken, and I recognise strongly from what they have said that there is an overall welcome for the Budget. That is because they know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is delivering fairness, social justice, equality
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
of opportunity and investment in health and education. The narrow nationalist agenda of looking inward in Wales will not meet the aspirations of people there, and nor will the narrow, introverted, tax-cutting agenda of the Conservative party.
