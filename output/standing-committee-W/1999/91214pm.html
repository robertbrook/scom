The Government's Legislative Programme and the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Report</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the Matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech and the Chancellor's Pre-Budget Report as they relate to Wales.—[<i>Mr. Paul Murphy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. Is it in order for the Secretary of State for Wales to change his coat mid way through the day?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude my remarks on the transport system. An integrated transport system and the way in which the Strategic Rail Authority operates are essential to Wales. For example, the valley lines, which operate in my constituency, begin and end in Wales and they must be integrated into the surrounding transport system.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State will consider the infrastructure in Wales and the amount that can be invested. Eight per cent. of Great Britain's route kilometres and 9 per cent. of its stations are in Wales, but only 2.4 per cent. of Railtrack's future expenditure plans relate to Wales. There is a significant discrepancy between the 2.4 per cent. figure and those other figures. Most of Railtrack's expenditure is associated with how much a network is used which partly explains the discrepancy.<br><br>
I also want to discuss the need for a children's commissioner for Wales. That proposal was not included in the Queen's Speech, but it could be added to a relevant Bill during its passage, or it might be introduced by another means. I have been involved in the campaign for a children's commissioner for a long time. Before I came to the House of Commons, I worked for Barnados and I have had dealings with many voluntary organisations in Wales that work with children. We are seeking to create the position of a children's commissioner. It should be filled by an independent person with an independent office in Wales, who should look after the interests of children in Wales. He or she would deal with complaints and be proactive in furthering children's rights. That would involve ensuring that the principles of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child are supported in Wales.<br><br>
There are many such positions worldwide. There is a commissioner in Sweden and in South Australia a children's interest bureau assesses draft legislation for its impact on children. We have discussed transport today, but did we consider the impact of transport
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
legislation on children? Every piece of legislation should be considered for its impact on children. A commissioner or a children's ombudsman is one way in which to do that.<br><br>
Children in Wales is a voluntary organisation that has led the way in this context. It organised a conference earlier this year in Cardiff at which the Norwegian children's ombudsman spoke. It was fascinating to learn about the range of issues in which he became involved and the way in which he advanced children's rights and made their voices heard.<br><br>
It is generally agreed that a children's commissioner should be set up because children are vulnerable. They do not have a voice—they do not vote and there is no way for them to advance their views. There is very little consideration of the impact of legislation on them and there is often little co-ordination between the Departments that have responsibility for them. For example, there are often few links between the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment.<br><br>
Some children suffer double discrimination—for example, refugee and gypsy children and those who lack the advantages of most children. It is vital to have a commissioner to examine all aspects of children's lives. I emphasise all aspects, as health and social services legislation may be more important than legislation that is directly related to children.<br><br>
When Children in Wales gave evidence to the Assembly, it gave an example of how children's needs may be addressed in ways that are not always obvious. At the end of the previous century, the number of children in miner's homes who died from scalding outnumbered the miners killed in pithead accidents. Baths of boiling water were placed in front of fires—my grandfather used such a bath—and children were often scalded. When pithead baths were opened, the number of children suffering scalds fell dramatically. Pithead baths were more effective than an expensive burns unit. I am trying to say that children are affected by wide-ranging issues. Children who live in poverty in Wales must also be considered and an ombudsman would help with that.<br><br>
It is important that a children's commissioner should be able to deal with all issues relating to children, whatever the basis of legislation, and all aspects covered by the Welsh Assembly and Westminster. The commissioner must have clout. An amendment might be made to the Care Standards Bill to enable a children's commissioner with statutory powers to be set up, but I would be worried that the commissioner could deal with issues relating only to social services. A similar amendment to the Local Government Bill might allow him to deal with issues relating only to local government. Careful thought must be given to the legislative basis for a children's commissioner and we must ensure that the commissioner has a lot of clout. The Assembly may prefer to operate without a legislative basis initially and then to establish where its legislative powers should come from.<br><br>

We owe it to the children of Wales to set up a children's commissioner or ombudsman to consider matters relating to children in Wales.</span></p>
<p>4.07 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State opened our proceedings this morning, he spoke passionately about the role of Members of Parliament at Westminster who represent Welsh constituencies and he referred to the need for the Welsh Grand Committee to continue its functions and deliberations, as it has done for many years.<br><br>
People in Wales who listen to our proceedings today may wonder what impact anything that we discuss here will have on the bread-and-butter issues that affect them. There is no doubt that, since 1 July, the people of Wales are represented by more people, but they may question whether they are better represented by those people who currently represent them in the Welsh Assembly and at Westminster. They may focus particularly on what their Members of Parliament are doing at Westminster because their role has changed and their effect has changed. Questions have been ruled out of order because they concerned devolved matters and all Members of Parliament have been restricted in the questions that they may ask.<br><br>
The matters affecting Wales that we may consider in this Committee have also changed post devolution. People will examine what we are doing here in the Welsh Grand Committee, in the St. David's day debate—I should be grateful if the Secretary of State could tell us whether we shall have such a debate next year—in Select Committees and other Committees dealing with Wales and Welsh questions. Post devolution, many people may say that Wales has lost its voice at Westminster. Whether it has also lost its heart will depend, in many ways, on what the Secretary of State intends to do in the job that he now holds. I wish him well in his position, because Wales deserves a representative at Cabinet level who fights hard for the people of Wales. People will also be looking carefully at the roles that are fulfilled by the other aspects and layers of Westminster Government.<br><br>
The Secretary of State spoke passionately about devolution. He said that the people of Wales delivered their voice and their verdict at the referendum—although he was generous enough to say that it was a slender victory, which is certainly true. I shall not rehash that battle—what has happened has happened. The people of Wales will now be keeping an eye on how well the bread-and-butter issues are dealt with by Government at all levels.<br><br>
I should like to make a plea to the Secretary of State, although he said that he was not willing to voice his opinion on the matter. The people of Wales—those who turned out to vote—gave devolution only a slim majority. Therefore, before any further devolution takes place—for example, before taxation-raising powers are devolved to the Welsh Assembly—the people of Wales should be consulted again, via a referendum, to establish whether that is their wish.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
Many people will be shocked by the increases in their council tax bills when they receive them in April. It is all very well for the Secretary of State to echo the theme that things have only got better for the people of Wales.<br><br>
We heard about the long list of people who have benefited from the election of a Labour Government. Can the Secretary of State tell me whether pensioners living in Anglesey, who face an increase of 16.5 per cent. in their council tax, will benefit? In Blaenau Gwent the increase will be 13.5 per cent., in Conwy it will be 13.8 per cent. and in Monmouthshire it will be 18.3 per cent. The average increase will be 10 per cent.—at a time when the inflation rate is 1.4 per cent.<br><br>
What should Members of Parliament who represent Welsh constituencies tell constituents who are facing those increases—that it is thanks to a Labour Government and a Welsh Assembly working hand in hand that they are to receive increases of six to eight times the rate of inflation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To clear up any possible confusion on the part of members of the Committee, will the hon. Gentleman explain whether the policies that he has enunciated are those of the whole Tory party? Last time he spoke about the powers of the Welsh Assembly, I heard him being contradicted by the leader of the Tory party within hours, and then contradicted in the opposite direction by various Members of the Welsh Assembly. Will he confirm whether he is speaking on behalf of the entire Labour—I mean, Tory—party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to speak on behalf of the entire Labour party, but we know that only one person does that nowadays, and he lives at 10 Downing street. Woe betide anyone who deviates off pager or off message. That includes the First Secretary, who is tied by an umbilical cord that leads all the way from Downing street, down the M4, to the Welsh Assembly.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about members of the Conservative party—yes, we are speaking with one voice. So far as further devolution is concerned, the jury is still out. That jury comprises the people of Wales.<br><br>
An aspect of the expenditure for which the Secretary of State is fighting so hard that will interest the people of Wales is the new Assembly building, which, according to the White Paper, was to cost £17 million to £20 million. We should not be surprised to learn that the current estimate for the new building is in the region of £30 million. Does the Secretary of State really believe that the people of Wales will be best served by expenditure of £30 million on a new building for the Assembly, as opposed to spending that money on schools, hospitals, farmers, and law and order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised the expenditure of money in Wales and the impotency of Members of Parliament in Westminster. He makes a valid point. It used to be a basic dictum of democracy that the people who voted the money could follow it through to the end. Unfortunately, we are impotent and useless in this place. If, for example, we asked questions about council tax and wanted to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
follow them up, we would be unable to do so. If we wanted to follow the line of money that we had voted in the Budget to be sent to Wales, we could not do so. It is the most undemocratic system that I know: the people who vote the money cannot follow it through to its expenditure. There is something fundamentally wrong with the present system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. There is something fundamentally wrong and there is a crisis of democracy. We have a Secretary of State for Wales here at Westminster who sits at the Cabinet table and helps to raise the money, which is then voted on by all Members of Parliament. We must remember that we are a United Kingdom Parliament. I would fight strenuously, and will join the Secretary of State for Wales and other Members representing Welsh constituencies, to ensure that we all have an opportunity to speak at Welsh Questions, and here in the Welsh Grand Committee.<br><br>
We do not want to be devoid of the powers and abilities that have rested in this place for centuries and have been hard won. All of a sudden, the money that has been hard fought for by the Secretary of State for Wales cannot be followed through in questions put by hon. Members at Westminster. That is a serious point. I hope that the Secretary of State will accept the fact that Conservative Members are sincere about that and will back any campaign to ensure that the Members of Parliament at Westminster—whether from Wales or other parts of the United Kingdom—have the ability to follow the money through to the end of its expenditure. That is an important point.<br><br>
I suspect that not everyone appreciated what the impact of the Government of Wales Bill would be during its passage. A small group of Members representing Welsh constituencies was shouted down time and again, when they voiced their concerns. They were also told to keep quiet behind the scenes. However, time has proved that they were right and that others were wrong in trying to quieten them on this issue. At the first Welsh questions, when the Speaker ruled many questions out of order, I thought that we should get through the Order Paper in about 15 minutes, and goodness knows what we should have done for the other quarter of an hour. There were grave causes for concern there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman clarify the present position of the Conservative party on what has been described as the constitutional settlement? Many Labour Members and many people in Wales will take the view that, in the light of the remarks of the Leader of the official Opposition, the Conservative party is committed to making the present arrangements work effectively, rather than crying over spilt milk and trying to rewrite history.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to clarify the position, which is that the Welsh Assembly is a reality and we want to ensure that it works for all the people of Wales—north, south, east and west—and that the money raised and voted for in this House is spent efficiently for all Welsh people.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
We are also dealing with the ability of Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies to fulfil their functions on behalf of their constituents. That settlement takes into account what Members of Parliament at Westminster do and what Members of the Welsh Assembly do. Part of the problem is that there will be a great deal of buck passing and the victims will be the people of Wales, who will not know to whom they should write. When something is wrong, all that they will receive is a letter from their Member of Parliament to say, "I have written to a Member of the Welsh Assembly." That Assembly Member will then pass the buck—Members of the European Parliament may become involved, councils may become involved—when all that the public wants is the service that they are paying for, whether through hefty increases in council tax or high taxation generally. We will wait, with great interest, to find out how the settlement pans out in the next 12 to 18 months.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech is a mixed bag. It would be ridiculous for me to say that everything in it is useless to the people of Wales. The Conservative party will support much in the Queen's Speech—the proposals on care leavers and those with special educational needs, and the proposals for care standards in Wales generally. We will examine the detail of those Bills and consider how we can support and improve such measures.<br><br>
However, the Queen's Speech has deficiencies. The Government think that they have a monopoly over concern for social exclusion but, time and again, Opposition Members draw attention to the problems of rural communities and, in particular, farmers and those whose livelihoods depend on the healthy condition of farms. We have all looked aghast at the beef on the bone question, scratching our heads about where responsibilities lie. We were told that the Welsh Assembly would lift the ban on beef on the bone almost immediately and much of the confidence in farming rested on that. However, when the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that beef on the bone was safe and he was ready to lift the ban, we were told that the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament had reversed their decisions and wished to seek further medical assurances. While farmers looked on and wondered what was happening, there was paralysis as the Minister representing England waited for the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament to announce that beef on the bone was safe. That situation continued for many weeks and was resolved only when the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decided that the ban would be lifted. The Welsh Assembly quickly followed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the, hon. Gentleman would not want to mislead the Committee. As I understand it, the chief medical officer for Wales, Dr. Ruth Hall, withheld her endorsement of lifting the ban until she was absolutely sure that she had the correct medical and scientific advice. It was nothing to do with Ministers in London. I wish that the Conservative party would stop playing petty politics with a disaster that it created.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to try to scrabble back some credibility with his own party—he supported something that I said earlier. It will not work with his party or with mine.<br><br>
There is an additional problem. This House cannot lift the ban until 17 December because of all the legal implications. The Welsh Assembly may not therefore have time to consider the matter until after 17 December and paralysis may afflict the beef issue again.<br><br>
Other hon. Members have mentioned that farmers in this country are living on much less than the minimum wage. Their industry has been rocked again by the inability and refusal of the French Government to lift the ban on our beef exports. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been unable to fight the British farmers' corner in the European Union, especially with the French and to a lesser extent with the Germans. While the ban remains in place, Welsh farmers will suffer, their incomes will continue to decline and confidence in Welsh farming will be further hit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence <span class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would the Tory policy of a tit-for-tat trade war achieve? Where would that leave Welsh sheep farmers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one in the Conservative party is talking about a trade war. [hon. Members: "Oh yes they are!"] The Labour party is trying to put words into the Opposition's mouth. Where an alternative exists, I am declining to eat French produce and I hope that other hon. Members are doing so.<br><br>
The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has resorted to gesture politics. He has refused to put his foot down and is being led by the nose by the French Government during every discussion, every committee meeting and every telephone conversation. The Commission must act. Interim measures must be put in place, so that the French Government are fined on a daily basis for their refusal to lift the beef ban. Such a legal option exists. I hope that the Minister will finally show a little backbone by starting to support Welsh farmers and insisting that those fines are put in place. Rural communities have been hit not simply by the state of beef farming but farming in general.<br><br>
Reference was made this morning to post offices and I welcome measures to commercialise them. In the light of changes in social security provision and the range of available options, concerns were expressed about the economic viability of many post offices. I accept that, in many rural communities, the post office is the only shop. I accept also that, during the past ten years, many post offices and small independent shops—as hon. Members know, I operate such a shop, although it is not in a rural community—have had a difficult time. In Gwent alone, 21 post offices have closed during the past five years.<br><br>
All parties must work together to find ways to give fresh assistance to post offices to enable their survival. That is not a party political point. I support the right of choice: for example, those who are unable to visit the post office weekly should be able to pay their pensions into bank accounts if they so wish. However, further measures must be taken to assist the small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
independent shop. Often, such a shop is the only one in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that 54 per cent. of all new child benefit payments and 47 per cent. of all new pension payments are already made through credit transfer? Surely it is only fair that people on benefits should have that opportunity. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Post Office's innovative horizons counters automation project is the best way in which to take advantage of electronic commerce, rather than sticking one's head in the sand and denying people the right to access their income electronically?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Electronic commerce is the future for a lot of trading, not simply post offices. We must accept that people want the security of having money paid directly into their bank accounts. One Committee member said this morning that 60 per cent. of a post office's trade could be lost if that were the case. We need to consider imaginative ways to support and sustain those rural businesses. All post offices sell stamps and postal orders, but in rural areas they also sell groceries, fresh vegetables and newspapers, which people in such areas may need. Such businesses must be given the opportunity to survive. In this modern world, many transactions may be done via the internet in ten years' time. We must consider, on an all-party basis, what we can do to sustain our rural post offices and rural businesses generally.<br><br>
The right to roam Bill was mentioned in the Queen's Speech. I am loath to support a member of Plaid Cymru in this context, but there will be problems with—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that we can do without his support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to destroy the credibility of another Member of Parliament.<br><br>
If the right to roam Bill is over-prescriptive it could cause problems for farmers. Instead of legislation, we should have a system of education that strengthens people's knowledge of rights of way. They need to know where rights of way are and they should acknowledge that much of the land that they may cross is used by others in their everyday lives. Leaving gates open causes problems with livestock. We need to ensure that people enjoy the countryside and that Welsh farmers will not be hit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with, or disassociate himself from, the comments of the Conservative Front-Bench spokesperson on agriculture and of the former Member of Parliament for Monmouth? Both of them said that that Bill amounts to a rural burglars' charter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disassociate myself from anything that Roger Evans said—[hon. Members: "Oh!"] I am happy to put his name on the record. If the hon. Gentleman has spoken to farmers in his constituency, he will know that there are concerns about the fact that increases in the numbers of people who access the countryside may cause increases in the level of crime. These days, people are able to get into remote properties and use their vehicles to make fast

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
getaways. I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman suggested that that would not be a problem.<br><br>
Another problem that affects law and order in the countryside is the fact that the number of police has declined in the past two and a half years. Labour Members repeat the mantra about being strong on law and order, but the number of police in rural areas has declined and continues to decline. That needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency, especially if more people are to be encouraged to access the countryside.<br><br>
Rural transport, which was mentioned in the Queen's Speech, has been hit hard in the past two and a half years. Farmers and people who live in rural areas have already been hit hard—they face some of the highest petrol and diesel prices anywhere in the European Union. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would take off the escalator at the next Budget, but that does not mean that the increase in taxation will not involve another hefty rise. If precedents are anything to go by, increases in petrol and diesel prices will continue.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech also announced the possibility of charging for parking at work and road tolling. Local authorities will decide whether they want to introduce those measures. Many local authorities, even given their enormous increases in council tax, will be considering ways to increase the revenues that they can spend in their areas. Work charges and tolling will place yet another enormous burden on motorists. They have already been caned once by petrol price increases—they could be caned again by work charges and tolling.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), a Plaid Cymru Member, suggested the introduction of car parking charges at supermarkets outside the main town and city areas. That is an abomination. It would be used as yet another stealth tax on shoppers. Supermarkets would be expected to pick up the charges that would be imposed on their customers and they would then pass them on in the form of higher charges for the goods that people buy in their shops. Of course, people would not readily know that they were paying those extra charges in higher prices. It would be yet another example of rip-off Britain.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the local government review. When I was a member of West Glamorgan county council for six years at least we had the option of open debate. As members of that council, we had the papers and debated the issues. Everyone was fairly well informed. Having spoken to members of the Conservative group on Newport council, I fear that that has changed. Fewer people are now given the opportunity to see the papers. The executive has taken over as far as that council is concerned. It is not only Conservative members of the council who are faced with the problem. Members outside the executive who are part of the Labour party are not receiving the papers either. That is fundamentally undemocratic. I understand that regional reporters from newspapers are also concerned, because they are not being given the copy that they can pass on to their readers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
Obviously, it is useful that the Welsh Assembly will be able to change and add nuances to the legislation. However, I am worried that if the trend continues in other local authorities, a problem for democracy will arise. People will question whether it is worthwhile being a councillor if they are in opposition and, if they are not part of the executive, they will question whether it is worth giving up their time to be a councillor in the first place. While the running of such a council may be more efficient, it will not be more democratic.<br><br>
I ask the Secretary of State to investigate what is going on in local government in Wales so that, during the passage of the Bill, we can suggest how we can make local authorities more democratic and widen the ability of people to serve on those councils. If the amount of information that appears in local papers about what is going on in local government declines, the thrust of the Bill, which is to increase the number of people voting in local elections, will be reversed and the number of voters will decrease. That gives me great cause for concern.<br><br>
I referred to social exclusion at the beginning of my speech and many people in Wales appear to be in that category. Will the Secretary of State reconsider the Representation of the People Bill—especially clause 9, which deals with the electoral register? It will give people the opportunity to tick a box so that they are not included on the register that is made available on a commercial basis to certain companies. I have received several representations from credit companies. People may not know that if they tick the box so as not to appear on the commercial register, they will perhaps not be able to seek credit if they try to buy items in shops, for example. They may not realise that because they do not appear on the commercial register, their ability to seek and gain credit may decline. That will hit people at the lower end of the income scale more than anyone else.<br><br>
Several charities are concerned. People believe that by taking themselves off the commercial register, the amount of junk mail that they receive will decline.<br><br>
The charities tell us, however, that they use the register to target more carefully the people at whom they aim rather than for blanket junk mailing. The Bill could mean that people receive more junk mail rather than less, and that charities may be involved in more expensive canvassing in Wales, as opposed to targeting campaigning more effectively at areas where they can prospect more carefully.<br><br>
The Opposition welcome the implementation of the Neill report. However, we are anxious about the limit on money to be spent by political parties during referendums. We have grave concerns that the measure will be geared to benefit the Labour Party's campaign for ensuring that the euro is adopted as quickly as possible. We are concerned about the amount of money being spent on the pro-euro campaigns, because the legislation and the way in which it is framed will mean that three times the amount of money will go into the "yes" campaign than will go into the "no" campaign. I have enormous reservations about the spending of any money on the euro campaign, because I fear that the people of Wales
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
and of Britain in general will reject the question when it is put before them. I still believe that the framing of the legislation is undemocratic and unfair in those respects.<br><br>
The people of Wales will look at the Queen's speech and they will ask not only whether they are getting more government and better government, but whether they are receiving better services. The answer has to be no. This morning, the Committee heard a lot about the new deal from Labour Members, but the fact is that the number of unemployed people in Wales has increased during the past few months. We now have the second largest number of unemployed people per head of the population. The Prime Minister may not think that a north-south divide exists, but there is certainly an east-west divide. People who live in the more rural areas, and especially in west Wales, will have been looking in the Queen's Speech for a boost to the rural economy, but it was simply not there.<br><br>
The Committee heard much this morning from the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) about the national health service. People will be aghast to find that the number of patients waiting more than six months to see a specialist has risen by a staggering 430 per cent. since March 1997—an increase of 25,630 people, which is an enormous number. The number of people waiting more than 12 months for an operation has risen by 2.9 per cent., and in particular pockets of Wales increases have been higher. The Dyfed Powys health authority had an increase of 7.2 per cent.<br><br>
Although the Queen's Speech announced some useful legislation, it will be judged overall by the people of Wales to be lacking. They will realise that the Government have not been listening to them during the past two and a half years. That is why the Government took a pasting at the European elections and the elections to the Welsh Assembly. The people of Wales want a Government who will listen more carefully to their needs and who will not merely talk about the right to roam or banning fox hunting and mink farming—the latter does not occur in Wales. They want a Government who will look for opportunities to improve education and the health service and who will ensure that pensioners will not receive a meagre pension rise at a time when their council tax is rising by four, five and eight times the rate of inflation. The Queen's Speech has let them down and the Government have let them down.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones, for the opportunity to participate in the debate. The Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget report were excellent. They build on previous legislative programmes under Labour Governments and on previous Budgets.<br><br>
I shall speak from the perspective of a Back-Bench constituency Member of Parliament about how the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement will affect my constituents. My constituency has the second highest number of pensioners in Wales. Those to whom I have spoken in the past two or three weeks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
were delighted with the announcement of an extra £100 winter fuel payment in this and future years. I warn the 16,263 pensioners in my constituency, who are sitting safe and warm by their fires knowing that they can afford the fuel to keep themselves warm this Christmas, to beware if the Tories ever get in again. They will return to the old days of 1985 when 5,000 pensioners froze to death in their own homes because they were afraid to turn up the heating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How, many of the 16,263 pensioners in the hon. Gentleman's constituency are happy with the average 10 per cent. council tax rise? It will wipe out the effect of the 73p increase in their pension and the help with their television licence if they are over 75.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sort of council tax rises that they will experience next year they also experienced during 18 years of Tory rule. [<i>Laughter.</i>] It is true.<br><br>
The help that we have given pensioners with their winter fuel allowance is not enough. We must consider help to insulate their homes and aim for north European standards. There are fewer winter deaths in other north European countries, although they have far colder winters than ours.<br><br>
I congratulate the National Energy Action charity for its efforts to keep pensioners warm. In the past few years, it has helped to insulate more than 2,000 homes in my constituency. I recently visited Mr. and Mrs. Smith of The Willows, Prestatyn, who had had the cavity walls in their home insulated. That will save them 35 per cent. on their fuel bills in future years.<br><br>
The proposals build on announcements in previous years. We have kept our pledge to cut value added tax on fuel from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent.; members of the Committee will remember that the Conservatives wanted to stack it up from 8 per cent. to 17.5 per cent. Labour, in alliance with pensioner groups, managed to stop them and forced them to climb down.<br><br>
Pensioners in my constituency are delighted that the over-75s will get a free television licence from next autumn. I have been active in politics in my local community for 15 years and I have had endless requests from pensioners, especially those in sheltered accommodation such as Cramer Court, Llys Glan Aber and War Memorial Court, who begged me to make representations to previous Governments for free television licences. Those representations were turned down. The Labour Government are delivering and giving the pensioners free television licences. In my constituency, 6,000 over-75s will benefit from that proposal, but it is not enough. I urge the Secretary of State to make representations so that when our national finances allow, free television licences will be available to all pensioners.<br><br>
The minimum income guarantee of £78 for pensioners, which was announced in the Budget will come on line in April next year. That, coupled with the free television licence and the fuel payment will mean an increase of between £300 to £500 per annum for pensioners in my constituency. That is not enough. I am sure that pensioners will be given the help that they richly deserve in future Budgets under a Labour Government.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
On the economy, Labour has already put in place many measures to encourage people to get back to work. It has introduced a vital factor that was missing in the 18 Tory years: fairness. That was an alien word to Conservatives in the previous Government. We have put in place the building blocks for a fair and just economy that will serve the many, not just the few.<br><br>
The minimum wage was opposed by the Tories. The working families tax credit was opposed by the Tories—[Hon. members: <i>"And they will get rid of it."</i>] I am coming to that. The new deal was opposed by the Tories. They believed that those measures would lead to massive unemployment. In their opinion, the minimum wage would make 2 million people unemployed, but more than 700,000 jobs have been created in the two and a half years since those measures were introduced. I warn the 200 young people in my constituency who are on the new deal, the 2,263 families in my constituency that have benefited from the working families tax credit and the 3,000 workers in my constituency who have benefited from the minimum wage, "The Tories will take you back to the old days, when the fat cats had their noses in the trough while some workers earned £1 an hour, if they get back into power." I am pleased that the Chancellor has built on past successes to extend the new deal to the over-25s by 2001.<br><br>
The Labour Government have introduced a range of measures to increase investment. That key factor was missing in the 18 years of Tory Government when the spectre of short termism ruled the economy. Short termism is tackled full on in the pre-Budget statement. Capital gains tax for long-term investment is cut from 40 to 24 per cent. for those who invest over three years and from 40 to 10 per cent. for those who invest over five years. The new employee share ownership scheme means that those workers who have held shares for five years will be exempt from tax. That is good news for the investment that we have been lacking in my constituency and the whole of Wales for the past 18 years.<br><br>
As for the economy of the future, some hon. Members referred to e-commerce. I am pleased that the Electronic Communications Bill was announced in the Queen's Speech. Electronic-commerce will dramatically expand in the next few years and the Bill is well placed to ensure that the people of Wales and the United Kingdom are at the forefront. The companies in my constituency that promote e-commerce, such as Marketsite, Eaziweb and the highly successful Cyberskills public-private partnership, which is headed by Roger Millward of Denbighshire county council, will welcome the measures to promote e-commerce.<br><br>
Other measures in the Queen's Speech will benefit my constituency, such as the Care Standards Bill. The North Wales hospital in Denbigh had 1,500 patients. Many of those vulnerable people settled in my community which, with 16,000 pensioners, has the second highest number in Wales. Some 2,000 to 3,000 of those people are in care homes, nursing homes and residential homes. They need help. Many people in their 30s and 40s, some of whom I know, were brutalised in gulags such as Bryn Estyn. I hope that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
the Care Standards Bill will provide the protection and security that they deserve.<br><br>
The Bill that introduces the right to roam will increase prosperity in my constituency which, fortunately, is blessed with an area of outstanding natural beauty and Offa's dyke. Indeed, the northern part of Offa's dyke ends in Prestatyn, which is the second largest town in my constituency. We have not used those natural and historical gifts to their full potential. The right to roam will encourage more visitors to come to my area and the extra money that they spend will help the local tourism economy. Coupled with objective 1 funding, I hope to spread that wealth around the constituency to build hotels and encourage farms to provide accommodation.<br><br>
In conclusion, the announcements made in the pre-Budget statement and the Queen's Speech will build on the policies that we have already put in place and will ensure that my constituency and the whole of Wales will enter the new millennium with a bright future.</span></p>
<p>4.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane). Offa's dyke also passes through my constituency, so we have something in common. However, our political views differ—his views hark back to the genuine voice of Novosibirsk.<br><br>
On a more charitable note, I want to move on to the Secretary of State's reply to my question. I am grateful to him for agreeing to see me about the conundrum of roads that cross the border. I shall certainly take up that issue and get in touch with the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Opik) because it is a key road in Wales and part of the trunk road plan. So far, I have been unable to secure an arrangement whereby Welsh funding could be provided for that road on the border with Wales, which also happens to be inside my constituency. I thought that the Government had totally washed their hands of the issue, so I am grateful.<br><br>
I am afraid that I must differ from the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd on another issue. It really is not good enough for the Government to take all the credit for the investment and prosperity that is now coming to Wales. Whoever had been in charge of Wales in the past 30 years would have had the ghastly job of changing its dependence on mining and the old steel industries. As more efficient means of creating energy were found through technological change someone had to do it. Whichever Government did that was bound to have a hideous problem on their hands, but some credit should be given to the previous Tory Government because we brought enormous change to the Welsh economy and introduced new industries.<br><br>
Although I was an unsuccessful candidate, 18,114 voters in Wrexham supported me. It was extraordinary to go around the factories—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I did not hear the sedentary intervention of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is just as well.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was fascinating to visit those factories and see how a town like Wrexham, which had been overwhelmingly dedicated to the coal industry and the steel works, had become a world leader in all sorts of other areas. There is a Kellogg's factory in Wrexham—one of 30 world wide—which is the most productive Kellogg's factory in the world. Other companies, such as JCB, would not have come to Wrexham if the right conditions had not been created by the Tory Government.<br><br>
We brought order to the labour market and reduced taxation and regulation, so that it was worth while building up industries. I would not describe the people who built them up as fat cats, as the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd did, but rather as brave people who invested in new businesses, with a work force who were accustomed to a completely different economic set up and who took the rewards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to check on the accuracy of the hon. Gentleman's facts. I have a feeling that the Kellogg's factory in Wrexham, which is not in my constituency, but is a lot closer to mine than it is to the hon. Gentleman's was brought to Wrexham before the previous Tory Government came to office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may well have been, but that entirely proves the point. Both parties faced the problem of replacing the old industries in Wrexham The Kellogg's factory was expanded thanks to the policies of Mrs. Thatcher and John Major. A whole flood of other factories have been opened since then. I do not want to recite a tedious list of businesses that have come to north-east Wales, but the most obvious one is Toyota. That business would not have come to Wales without the personal intervention of the then Secretary of State for Wales, David Hunt.<br><br>
The Government cannot take all the credit for what is happening, but the new investment is very much welcomed. Neither can they claim the credit, through the new deal, for the dramatic fall in youth unemployment. During the lunch break, I took the time to dig out some figures. Between April 1993 and May 1997, long-term youth unemployment fell by a little less than 250,000. By July, it would have been 250,000, or a quarter of a million. That means that the Labour party's claims for the new deal are completely false. The fall in youth unemployment was simply a continuation of the trend started under the Conservative Government.<br><br>
At the time, <i>The Economist,</i> an impartial source, stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"there are no longer 250,000 youngsters to help,"</p></blockquote>
The £2.6 billion that has been confiscated by the windfall tax from various industries, mainly in the energy sector, could easily have been set aside. However, that was not relevant; the real relevance was growth in the United Kingdom. It is businesses and not Governments that create jobs—a fundamental fact that some earlier speakers have not taken on board. Businesses do not make money if they are not competitive and if taxation is raised. The Government have introduced a huge hike in taxation of about £50 billion through various stealth taxes, including the pension tax and so on.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
Fuel taxes affect most people in Wales and are a concern of many constituents who come to see me in Oswestry market. They have been devastating and I have so far failed to get out of the Government a sensible answer to my questions. The Opposition have applied pressure, and I take up the point made by the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Gareth Thomas), who said that it was thanks to Labour Members that fuel problems were brought to the Government's attention. I initiated an Adjournment debate on 11 November last year on the hideous problems created by the rise in vehicle excise and fuel duties.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Secretary of State could help me on the matter. Table B9 on page 154 of the pre-Budget report shows that fuel duties are set to increase from £21.6 billion to £22.5 billion next yea and they will increase to £23.5 billion in 2000–2001. We keep hearing that the Government have listened and that they are going to stop the escalator. If the escalator is being stopped, why is the substantial and constant increase to which I referred going to be made in the take from fuel duties? I should be grateful if the Secretary of State would ask some questions and find an answer to that question—he has a few minutes to do so. The fuel duty and vehicle excise duty problem affects every single business in Wales and is having an appalling effect. When it was introduced by the Conservative party—it was bound to be taken over by Labour Members at some time—there were only two other competitor countries in Europe with lower fuel prices than those in the United Kingdom. We had the third cheapest fuel in Europe, but we now have easily the most expensive fuel in Europe. It is more than twice as expensive than fuel in Spain, for example, and three times more expensive than fuel in Turkey, which was last week invited to join the European Union.<br><br>
That difference in prices makes every business in Britain dramatically less competitive and is almost entirely due to the increase in duty. Eighty five per cent. of the price of a litre of fuel is duty. As competitor countries have a more intelligent Government attitude to fuel duty, Britain is penalising a core industry in rural and industrial Wales. Diesel-powered trucks carry 97 per cent. of freight in rural areas. At a time when agriculture is struggling, the Government should talk about reversing the escalator and not just about stopping it. I am glad that the Secretary of State may be taking measures to find out the facts. We need that escalator not merely to be stopped but actively reversed, and the same problem must be dealt with in respect of vehicle excise duty. How on earth can Welsh companies compete when it costs £5,750 to tax a 40-tonne truck in Wales, but only £486 in France, £328 in Spain and £308 in Portugal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Conservative Government introduced the escalator, did they set any period for it to last?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether there was a fixed period. I am being honest—I do not know the answer. The level was set at 3 per cent. at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: 5 per cent.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it began at 3 per cent., and we had the third lowest fuel costs in western Europe. We now have double—[<i>Interruption.</i>] If hon. Members rise from their seats, rather than mutter, I shall take an intervention. For the benefit of the muttering tendency, I remind the Committee of the current duties. In the United Kingdom, we are paying 47.4p per litre, while the EU average is 22.7p. The escalator has gone far too far and it has not achieved its aim, which was to reduce heavy traffic on the roads.<br><br>
Figures from the Library show that, to the end of the second quarter of 1999, there was a spectacular increase in the number of foreign trucks entering this country, up from 597,000 in 1997 to 805,000 this year. The equivalent figures for UK-registered trucks show an increase from 543,000 to 558,000. I predicted that in my Adjournment debate last year, but was pooh-poohed by the Minister. The policy is a straightforward attack on the strategic haulage industry. Even if we doubled the investment in freight on the railways, 90 per cent. of freight would still go by road—but instead of going in British trucks, it would go in foreign trucks. There is no enviromnental gain.<br><br>
A constituent of mine, Mr. David Yarwood, wrote to me only this week. He runs a trucking company, Greyroads Ltd, which does a lot of business in Wales. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wherever you travel Continental lorries can be seen either loading or carrying out internal domestic haulage, all at the expense of the British industry. I never thought I would see the day when French Tipper lorries could carry scrap metal from the Midlands to South Wales Steel Plants and then return to the Midlands with Coke …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>British Hauliers are unable to get rate increases as they are being undercut by the Continentals who are running on cheaper French fuel. I understand that when they are running low on fuel they take a load back to the Continent, fill up then re-enter the UK. Foreign hauliers do not contribute to the Treasury but they do put honest British Hauliers out of business."</p></blockquote>
It is a totally counterproductive policy. It is estimated that we will lose about £1 billion in tax revenue by 2002 and more than £2 billion in gross domestic product.<br><br>
With the Green Book showing an alarming increase in fuel duties, I hope that the Secretary of State will tell his Cabinet colleagues that this policy is not working. There is absolutely no environmental gain because the load has to be carried; we are simply handing over business from good Welsh and other UK companies to foreign competitors who enjoy more sensible tax regimes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just a thought on why duty might be increasing: without looking at the details, I would hazard a guess that part of any increase is related to the fact that we have a successful Chancellor and an outstanding economy. Therefore, more is happening. We might be trying to put more freight on to rail, but the fact that the economy is expanding means more journeys and therefore more tax to be collected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly an element of growth, but the figures that I gave showed a dramatic increase in the number of foreign trucks coming to this country and putting British truckers out of business, as one can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
see from the number of closures in the British haulage industry.<br><br>
I know that other hon. Members want to speak, so I shall quickly deal with my other main concern about the Queen's Speech: it offered extraordinary little to the Welsh rural economy. The main measure is the right to roam—a politically correct proposal that will bring no benefit whatever to the farmers who come to markets in my constituency. It is not a right; one cannot run a capitalist society without respecting freedom of private property, but that measure is a major invasion of private freedoms.<br><br>
The public already have access to substantial areas of the countryside. The national parks cover 48,000 hectares, there are more than 105,000 miles of footpaths and the countryside access scheme covers 1,500 hectares. I could go on. We will get more members of the public into the countryside by working closely in voluntary schemes with landowners, not by imposing an Act on unwilling partners. I foresee a number of problems.<br><br>
First, there is the problem of defining land. It will be extremely difficult to draw the line between intensively and extensively managed grassland, for example. I am seriously concerned about the impact on wildlife, especially on moorland, where there are many ground-nesting birds. Sadly, many people who go to the countryside do not understand what goes on there. Last year, a lady was killed on a public footpath while walking her dogs after being attacked by some cows. The countryside cannot be seen to be a playground. It is a place where people make money—although with real difficulty at the moment, given the crisis in agriculture—and we should not place further burdens on them.<br><br>
I shall mention briefly one more measure, which affects the livestock industry in Wales. I never thought that the Welsh Assembly could damage Britain's agriculture, but the farce over beef on the bone had a real impact on our French neighbours. Because of the hideous problems that they had with HIV-infected blood—over which Laurent Fabius, the French Prime Minister, nearly went to jail and his Health Minister did go to jail—there is great nervousness in France about health scares.<br><br>
Following the BSE scandal, we now know that there is no link between BSE and new variant Creutzbeldt-Jakob disease, and that one is twice as likely to get hit by a meteorite as contract new variant CJD from beef on the bone. This ban, which was upheld by the Welsh Assembly, was grabbed by the French as an excuse for delay. That was clearly shown in a letter to the <i>Farmers Guardian</i> of 22 October 1999, signed by Mr. Jean-Jacques Benezit, the agricultural counsellor to the French Embassy in London. In it, he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is worth noting that the British Government adheres wholly to this precautionary principle, judging by some recent rulings, such as the ban on beef-on-the-bone."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member can help the Committee. Four other hon. Members are seeking to catch my eye.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall wind up by saying that the ban on beef on the bone had a much more lasting effect on the Welsh livestock business than was appreciated at the time.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech was a missed opportunity for rural Wales, which is experiencing its biggest crisis since the 1930s. Welsh farmers could have been helped if certain major issues had been addressed, such as reducing abattoir costs, and helping Milk Marque. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The imposition of abattoir costs has been devastating for small farmers in Wales. There was nothing in the Queen's Speech about pulling back extra costs such as those incurred in taking the spines out of sheep, or about feeding meat and bonemeal, or about labelling. The Queen's Speech could have helped Welsh farmers and related industries in all those areas, but it failed to do so.</span></p>
<p>5.11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to make a few brief comments. I am grateful that the Secretary of State put this debate into its proper context—this is the first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee since the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales. This is also the last meeting of this kind this century.<br><br>
I congratulate the Secretary of State on outlining the vision that underlies not only his stewardship of the Welsh Office but that of the Government as a whole in relation to the interests of the United Kingdom. It is surely right to strive for an enterprising society, and a strong and stable economy in which productivity is increasing. We have international support and evidence that many of our competitors respect the fact that the Government's policies are good for the economy, jobs and productivity.<br><br>
There is, however, another ingredient in the thrust of the Government's policy that I welcome. That is the idea that it is possible to have an enterprising society and a fair society at the same time. The two are not mutually exclusive. The Secretary of State was right to underline that vision.<br><br>
However, I am perhaps not alone on this side of the Committee in expressing a degree of disappointment about the poor quality of the contributions from Opposition Members. A distinct lack of vision was demonstrated in the sustained whinge of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Of course he is right to emphasise the problems facing the rural community. I know that rural Wales is facing a crisis as a result of a combination of inherited and difficult circumstances, but the Government are striving to improve the situation in all sorts of ways, not least through working strongly within Europe. No one can deny that considerable amounts of money have been put into the hands of farmers through agrimonetary compensation, and increased hill livestock compensatory allowances. I am pleased that there has been some movement on rural development regulation and on modulation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was right when he said that there are difficulties in rural communities, but he was wrong to have focused
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
on that. The Government have introduced various social measures: the working families tax credit means extra money for poorer families; the minimum wage legislation was magnificent; the new deal is now being extended to the over-25s; and the child care tax credit has been introduced with extra money for schools and hospitals. Those social measures affect everyone in Wales and I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not accept that. Perhaps it is a reflection of how deeply divided his party is. It is a Janus party, which is finding it difficult to pander to its interest groups in rural Wales while trying to offer something to the rest of the world. The Labour party is the Government for all of Wales.<br><br>
The 28 Bills in the Queen's Speech include some important measures. The Freedom of Information Bill and leasehold reform Bill are welcome, as are the eight Home Office Bills. I know that you are keen to allow other hon. Members to speak, Mr. Jones, so I shall conclude by referring specifically to the way in which the Government are striving to improve the lot of poorer pensioners.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd said that his constituency contains the second highest number of pensioners in Wales. My constituency contains the highest number. No less than 7,190 pensioners will benefit from the free television licences for the over-75s. The winter fuel allowance of £100 is a great benefit that will make a real difference to people's lives, as will the minimum income guarantee. They are all worthy and welcome measures. The Government are on the right track. They are creating a fairer, more enterprising society. I welcome the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget statement.</span></p>
<p>5.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for this opportunity to speak in this important debate of the Welsh Grand Committee. The pre-Budget statement and the radical legislative programme follow on from the two previous programmes that we have enjoyed as a Government on the eve of the millennium. Our two previous programmes can be summarised by the manifesto that a previous Member of Parliament for Merthyr Tydfil, Keir Hardies set out in 1899. The three key tenets of that programme—I am sure that you do not need to be reminded of them, Mr. Jones—were reform of the second Chamber, devolution to Scotland, Wales and Ireland, and the introduction of a statutory minimum wage.<br><br>
What we have achieved to date is no mean feat, given that we have had to wait 100 years for it. It is a valuable programme, with a balance of policies that will be good for the Welsh people—practical legislative proposals and a radical content. It includes access to the countryside, freedom of information and, dear to my heart, the major Transport Bill that we have all waited for. It is important to recognise that references in the Queen's Speech to transport legislation and transport policy mean a raft of integrated policies affecting the quality of life of everyone in Wales. The key is to ensure that we have the right transport strategy to free up and realise the huge potential of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
Wales for the environment, quality of life and, most importantly, economic policy.<br><br>
During the past ten years, despite what Conservative Members have claimed, Wales has suffered badly from 18 years of Tory rule.<br><br>
The nonsense that is talked about the prosperity that our country enjoyed is simply untrue. During that period, there was a very high proportion of direct foreign investment in Wales, largely as a result of the efforts of the Welsh Development Agency that the previous Labour Administration created, and despite the efforts of successive Tory Administration. However, although we in Wales enjoyed one of the highest proportions of foreign inward investment per capita during that period, the reality is that we underperformed, and had some of the lowest proportions of UK domestic investment. The Government, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Assembly must address that through our legislative programme, which must create the right climate for economic development in Wales.<br><br>
I am delighted to say that, tomorrow, the Assembly will debate the image of Wales, particularly its business image, and I wish its Members well. I hope that the debate will be inclusive, rather than a party political squabble. It is a great opportunity for the Assembly to present Wales as it is, and to show what Wales has to offer investors throughout the world, but particularly those in London, the square mile and the south-east, where the largest proportion of potential new investors is located.<br><br>
It is vital that we get our transport policy right, and I draw Committee members' attention to an aspect of transport that affects everybody. We will not have a thriving modern economy that can build on existing strengths and resources without a premier international airport that is capable of serving the entire Welsh economy. It is true that Cardiff international airport serves most of Wales, and that another international airport—at Manchester—serves the north Wales economy along the A55, but south Wales has no similar facility. Modern airports are the cutting edge of business communication. Although our airport is one of the most modern in the world, and is capable of serving four million passengers, it serves approximately one million passengers only. We must improve the transport infrastructure by providing dual carriageway access from the motorway network, so that it can serve the whole of Wales. That is vital to the Welsh economy, and I ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales to consider that view.</span></p>
<p>5.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence <span class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief I have sat through most of the debate and, as has been mentioned several times, the key to it is the link between enterprise and fairness. I was astounded to discover that the Opposition think that the pre-Budget statement and the Queen's Speech offer nothing to Wales. The framework of enterprise and fairness contains measures such as the provision of £100 for every pensioner household. In my constituency, where the number of pensioners is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
rising, that will provide security during the bad Welsh weather. Furthermore, the new deal and the working families tax credit are underpinned by a minimum wage, which has improved enormously the standard of living of my constituents. I represent one of the largest rural constituencies in Wales, and I was astonished to hear it said that those measures offer nothing to rural Wales.<br><br>
I have two brief points to make. The forthcoming programme caters comprehensively for small businesses. Small businesses provide jobs for 95 per cent. of the population in my area. They provide the best opportunity for sustainable jobs, and will be given a helping hand by tax relief for large companies that invest in small companies. Such measures, in addition to cuts in capital gains tax, will offer real opportunities in my area. Underlying all that is the Government's commitment to economic stability, instead of the proverbial boom and bust of the Conservative party.<br><br>
The Government could not have delivered a better measure for the people of Wales than the National Assembly itself Wales and its Welsh people are finding their feet, gaining confidence and recognising that they have a great deal to offer to the wider world. I shall add a word of caution. There is no finer nation than Wales when it is confident in its roots, culture and language. However, woe betide any nation that turns patriotic pride into narrow nationalism. We are Welsh, we are Labour and we are internationalist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blacnau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And we are socialists. That is why we are good for Wales—the Conservative party, as has been shown in the past, does nothing but harm Wales.</span></p>
<p>5.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chancellor of the Exchequer's pre-Budget report contains a wide range of measures that will be welcomed in my constituency. More than 6,500 pensioners aged over 75 will benefit from the introduction of free television licences. All pensioner households will gain £100 of winter fuel payments, and nearly 2,000 families will benefit from the working families tax credit. Long-term unemployment has fallen by 47 per cent., and youth unemployment by a staggering 63 per cent. Those dramatic falls result from the Government's competent economic management, with steady economic growth, low inflation and low interest rates. The fall in unemployment can also be attributed to the new deal, which the official Opposition are committed to abolishing, along with the national minimum wage.<br><br>
Monmouthshire is perceived as an affluent county, and I accept that many of its residents have an above average income. Many, however, have as low an income as people anywhere else in Wales. Nearly 2,000 families will benefit from the working families tax credit, which is more than in the constituencies of the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, my hon. Friend the Minister—who represents Delyn—and my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan), for Cardiff Central (Mr. Jones) and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Sir J Morris).<br><br>
The indicators of social deprivation were set out recently in a report by Monmouthshire county council. Dewstow in Caldicot is among the worst-off local authority wards in Wales. In Llanelly Hill, an isolated community, there is little transport—it is a community that looks more towards the south Wales valleys than the rural areas of Monmouthshire. I asked the Welsh Affairs Committee to consider coming to Monmouthshire as part of its investigation into social exclusion. Deprived communities such as Llanelli suffer a double disadvantage because its local government finance settlement is lower than in any other area of Wales.<br><br>
The countryside Bill is most welcome, as it gives greater protection to sites of special scientific interest and greater access to open countryside. Much of Monmouthshire is cultivated land, and is clearly outside the scope of the Bill. Farmers should therefore be assured that there is no right to roam over cultivated land. The Government are committed to strengthening designated areas of outstanding natural beauty. One of those, in my constituency, is where Chepstow Park forest is based. I have secured an Adjournment debate on the matter, and I shall not rehearse the arguments this afternoon. If Forestry Commission land is to be sold in Wales, the Welsh Assembly should first consider that policy. It should be based on an economic strategy and an envirommental assessment. Rather than Forestry Enterprise working in the interests of developers, a tourism strategy should be followed. The change of Government has ensured a change of policy in that area.<br><br>
The Freedom of Information Bill will also be welcomed. We could have done with more freedom of information on the arts strategy in Wales. My hon. Friends the Members for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) and for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) and I have repeatedly asked the Arts Council of Wales reasonable and simple questions, but we have not received simple answers. I shall repeat one or two of those questions. How can Theatr Iolo, which is a Cardiff-based company, be awarded a franchise in south-east Wales for which—apparently—it did not apply? A key criterion was that it should have received the support—including the financial support—of a local authority, but it could not have received that support because it did not seek it. Having failed to get the contract and the franchise for the area in which it made a bid—the mid-Wales valleys—it appears that the franchise that it received was awarded as a consolation prize. There are serious irregularities in this case, which I hope will be examined by the Welsh Assembly's further education Committee.<br><br>
In the spirit of open government, my reasonable question must be asked. The sum of £125,000 of public money was allocated in the franchise, but we have not seen the bids. In an Adjournment debate the week before last, my hon. Friend the Minister asked the Arts Council of Wales to deposit copies of the bids in the House of Commons Library. However, I have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
inquired at the Library, and I learned that although Theatr Gwent's bid is there, Theatr Iolo's is not. I leave that matter with the Minister, and I hope that the Arts Council of Wales will be chased up.</span></p>
<p>5.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate, which has covered much territory.<br><br>
The proposals in the Queen's Speech about freedom of information are welcome—the Liberal Democrats have long supported them. The Transport Bill is clearly necessary, and the social security reform Bill contains some useful proposals. We have reservations about the Local Government Bill, but I stress that Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals about the minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the creation of a National Assembly—that has been a Liberal Democrat policy for a long time—and the new deal. However, those proposals were in previous Queen's Speeches. There may have been handouts, though not necessarily of a financial nature. Statistics about the number of pensioners have been flying around, and credit should be given where it is due—pensioners will be better off as a result of the decision about television licences for the over-75s. As my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire emphasised, that was another Liberal Democrat policy.<br><br>
Much of the Queen's Speech is an agenda for middle England rather than for Wales, which has more pressing problems. This is likely to be the last full legislative Session of the Parliament. The Queen's Speech is somewhat timid; it does nothing to solve the growing problem of national health service waiting times. Since the Labour Government came to power in 1997, the number of people in Wales who have had to wait for more than six months for a first out-patient appointment has increased fivefold. There are 50,000 primary-aged pupils in Wales in classes of more than 30. The Government have achieved their targets for the under-sevens, but we must consider children aged between seven and 11, many of whom are in classes of more than 30 pupils.<br><br>
There are no proposals to guarantee European matched funding for Wales other than those that are given in the Barnett block to enable us to draw down our full allocation of European funding. The Chancellors initiative of a three-year period for the comprehensive spending review has slightly muddied the waters. He had to advance the proposal by one year, but in 2000–2001 we shall still be short of sufficient resources to provide matched funding to kick-start the structural fund programmes.<br><br>
The Queen's Speech also refers to the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill, about which we are very concerned. It will abolish the right to trial by jury, which involves a serious and dangerous weakening of civil rights. It will put economic savings before the quality of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill to which the hon. Gentleman refers does nothing of the sort. It simply reforms and makes more logical the procedure for deciding the venue for trial. It is a travesty to suggest that it abolishes jury trial.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the hon. Gentleman's view. Many members of the legal profession believe the opposite.<br><br>
The Secretary of State will have seen a headline in <i>The Western Mail</i> this morning, stating: "Prescott bypasses Wales". Will the Under-Secretary tell us whether there will be more investment in the roads programme for Wales? The town of Talgarth in my constituency has been waiting for a bypass since 1938. We had promises of a bypass in 1988 and 1990 from Sir Wyn Roberts when he was Minister of State. We were told that the road would be completed by 1995. There was a public inquiry, but the juggernauts are getting bigger and knocking down the town. The Mid-Wales hospital has been closed and 400 people lost their jobs. It is vital that the trunk road remains open and for £3 million, the problem could be solved. The conclusion of the public inquiry was that that should be done.<br><br>
We have heard many speeches today emphasising urban and rural matters in Wales. It is vital to unite Wales, and that requires enlightened leadership. When the Welsh agricultural college was created at Aberystwyth—I was a member of the original staff of seven—more than half of the funding came from Glamorgan county council. There was enlightened communication between urban Wales and rural Wales for the good of the whole of Wales. We must not lose those ideals in the Assembly or the House. We must co-operate for the good of the whole of Wales.<br><br>
I understand urban deprivation. My grandfather went down a colliery in Glamorgan at the age of 14 and my ancestors farmed in my present constituency, so I have a balanced view of the problems of the whole of Wales. We must build bridges. There is a crisis in the countryside. It is unacceptable that hill farmers are earning 37p an hour, or £15 a week, or £1,700 per annum. Compare that with the £3.50 minimum wage, which I support. We need more investment and we need food processing, which will go ahead with Welsh Development Agency initiatives. We need dedicated export of calves to farms in Holland, where we can ensure that animal welfare is considered. Calves can be exported at six months of age, which would bring a lot of money into agriculture. We used to export whole carcases of sheep and it is ridiculous that we can no longer do so. That would provide a higher return and would require not an injection of public money but simply the opening up of markets.<br><br>
Reform of the hill livestock compensatory allowance has been discussed constructively in the Assembly and there have been some positive moves.<br><br>
On poverty, will the Secretary of State discuss with his colleagues miners' widows, whose coal allowance is being translated into oil and who are losing benefit? Many of my constituents in the Swansea valley receive cash in lieu of their concessionary coal and are losing benefit. I could name many of my constituents who are in that situation, and it is not on.<br><br>
The Secretary of State justified this Committee meeting from time to time, particularly to discuss matters such as the Queen's Speech and the Budget.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
The Chancellor's ideas on post-devolution partnership are very important, and have certainly been put into practice by the Welsh Affairs Committee, of which I am a member. I congratulate the Chairman of that Committee on his good work in that respect.<br><br>
There is an occasional role for the Welsh Grand Committee but it must not be overdone: the Welsh Affairs Committee also provides good scrutiny. We all agree that devolution is a process, not an event.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No we do not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent, who dared proudly to mention the word "socialism"—I give him full marks for guts—takes a slightly different view.<br><br>
The Welsh Development Agency is doing good work, although we feel that more could be done for rural Wales. It needs to do much more to kick-start the economy. This morning, I referred to proportional representation in local authority elections. If we are to stop corruption in local government—there has been plenty of that in Wales proportional representation is vital. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy rightly highlighted the rural crisis. A lot has been said on that subject, and I shall not repeat what he and I have said, except to say that the crisis is real and must be properly addressed.<br><br>
The Transport Bill has been the subject of considerable comment, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Cardiff, North on explaining the problems in her constituency. Yesterday, my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire and I were stuck in a traffic jam in her constituency, and we know from first-hand experience—perhaps I should say third-class experience—precisely the problems that she faces.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend made an excellent speech on problems in the health service, with which he is very familiar. The problem of health service funding, which is close to the hearts of Welsh people, is endemic. There is never enough money, and much sorting out still needs to be done. The stock-take document to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which was produced by the former Secretary of State for Wales, prompted a crisis in the health service in Wales. It highlighted the deficits and debts of health authorities, which must be written off. Many trusts in Wales are under severe financial strain and are reducing bed numbers in an effort to cope with a debt that grew year on year under the previous Government.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire raised many issues, including the fuel duty escalator. The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) cried crocodile tears over that measure, but it was the previous Government—his Government—who introduced it. It has generated so much revenue that it has contributed to the Chancellor's £12 billion surplus. I am glad to hear that the Chancellor will not continue with that measure, although there is no guarantee that he will not impose fuel taxes of the kind that have devastated rural areas with no public transport.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot, I have only two minutes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) provided an interesting insight into the workings of Gwynedd county council. Clearly, there are problems there, and I listened intently to what she had to say.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) talked about devolved matters, and the re-running of a referendum if powers are to be extended to the Welsh Assembly. That is rather unlikely. He also talked about beef on the bone. Much of what he said was humbug, because his party created the beef crisis in the first place.<br><br>
I was glad to hear the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd mention pensioners. He said that they were warm, but there is no global warming in Committee Room 14. The insulation of homes is important, as is the insulation of Committee Rooms. I observed the warm homes initiative in my constituency recently, and it is impressive. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) mentioned Keir Hardie's manifesto, which the Labour and Liberal parties have taken almost a century to fulfil. We were in power for 40 years of this century, whereas the Conservatives had 60 years, so we have not had a lot of time. I hope that the Government will respond to the Committee's concerns.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to conclude the debate. It has been an interesting debate, and wide-ranging contributions have been made by hon. Members from all parties. I shall try to respond to as much as possible, bearing in mind that only fourteen and a half minutes remain.<br><br>
This Committee meets at the mid-way point of this Parliament. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan said, a minimum wage has been introduced for the first time, which benefits 109,000 people in Wales. Devolution is up and running for the first time, which benefits and operates in partnership with central Government, and reform of the House of Lords has taken place. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan said, Keir Hardie would have been proud of all those things. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) would also recognise that, if he were present.<br><br>
The introduction of the working families tax credit is also part of the background of this debate. It benefits 80,000 people in Wales, many of whom live in rural areas. Child benefit has risen by 25 per cent since this Government came to power. The new deal is creating employment for people under 25. You will know, Mr. Jones, of the pilot project to get over-50s back into work, as we both attended the recent launch in Broughton.<br><br>
We have cut value added tax on fuel to 5 per cent, and given extra resources to health since May 1997. The Assembly has nearly £300 million of extra money to tackle health issues, in contrast to the Conservative party regime. The new deal for schools has provided
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
extra money for real improvements in classrooms and reductions in class sizes throughout Wales. The Government's programme underpins fairness, modernisation and enterprise, and the Queen's Speech and pre-Budget report make important changes for the future.<br><br>
We do not shy away from the problems of rural areas. Spending on rural areas has increased, and the Government are committed to tackling some of the deep-seated issues that affect those areas. The securing of objective I funding for much of Wales, including the valleys and rural areas, is central to that.<br><br>
I listened with incredulity to the hon. Members for Ribble Valley and for North Shropshire. They seemed to imply that nothing that happened before 1 May 1997 caused any of the difficulties that we are trying to tackle. They cannot have it both ways. Would they support the working families tax credit, the new deal, the minimum wage and the pre-Budget statement proposals? The pre-Budget report and the Queen's Speech build on the themes of fairness, modernisation and enterprise.<br><br>
I note that my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mrs. Lawrence), for Vale of Clwyd and for Clwyd, West mentioned their commitments to pensioners. I went recently to Bangor, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy, where I gave a cheque to the first pensioner in Wales to receive the £100 winter fuel payment. That will make a big difference to people who need help with heating through the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave a cheque for £100; local authorities will now, in effect, claw back that sum through increased council tax. What did he say to the pensioners about increased council tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know what that pensioner said: she thanked the Labour Government. I suspect that the 230,000 pensioners in Wales aged over 75 who will have a free television licence next year, and those who will benefit from the extension of the new deal for the over-25s, will look at the pre-Budget report and say that the Government are making real advances and are helping. There has been support for some measures from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire mentioned tax policy for companies that ensure that we encourage enterprise and long-term investment, and tax cuts to support real investment in future industries. Such measures will benefit urban Wales, valley Wales, city Wales and rural Wales. The themes of fairness, modernisation and enterprise are key.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And seaside Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seaside Wales and north-east Wales.<br><br>
Our legislative programme is building on what the Government have done on those themes. The Care Standards Bill, the Local Government Bill and the Bill on learning and skills are not made in middle England, as the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire suggests. They are made to help to give powers to the Assembly to improve standards in regulation, to improve the mechanism and accountability of local

government and to improve opportunities for learning new skills for those aged 16 to 19. The Transport Bill is about giving powers to ensure that we improve and develop the transport system, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North and others said. The Bill on countryside amenities and conservation—the right to roam Bill, as it is better known and which almost all the Opposition parties oppose—will introduce real rights for people in Wales as we face the next millennium. The Children (Leaving Care) Bill is also important.<br><br>
We shall consider how we can build on the issues raised by the Bills in a Welsh context. Many Bills, such as the Freedom of Information Bill and the Electronic Communications Bill, are supported across the United Kingdom. We are a UK Parliament and Government delivering for Wales from both a Welsh and a Westminster context. We shall meet the Assembly, talk with the Assembly Committee's chairs and work in partnership to deliver what is best for Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister plan to meet the Assembly to discuss the situation in Gwent and elsewhere? Before being appointed, the chairperson of the Arts Council for Wales quango described the drama strategy as a tragedy that would further disadvantage some of the poorest communities in Wales and said that the consultation process had been a mockery. Since being appointed chairperson, by sheer coincidence and to the surprise of all, she has defended the document that she damned. The losers, once again, are some of the poorest communities, including mine. Will the Minister raise the issue when he meets the Assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, we covered such issues during our recent Adjournment debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) also mentioned the matter. I made representations and am awaiting responses; I shall ensure that responses are forwarded.<br><br>
Emphasis has been placed on the need to ensure that we manage, develop and support rural areas. The hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, for Montgomeryshire and for Brecon and Radnorshire mentioned the matter, as did the Conservative Members who are our guests. The Government are addressing the real issues. From the block grant money given by the Government, the Assembly plans a rise in net expenditure on agriculture from £237 million to O07 million in the next three years. There is increased expenditure in rural Wales.<br><br>
I am pleased that at its plenary session tomorrow the Assembly will consider a motion to lift the ban on beef on the bone. If the motion is endorsed, I expect the Assembly to lift the ban on 17 December, as planned. That must be welcomed, given that the ban occurred because of the actions of Opposition Members, which caused distress to the farming communities.<br><br>
Expenditure on rural areas has increased dramatically; my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food allocated a £15 million package to the Welsh Assembly to support HLCA farmers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned organic food. Additional resources are being allocated by the Assembly to that important issue.<br><br>
Members mentioned the future of post offices and it is important that we pin down the arguments being advanced. There certainly will be changes in how automated credit transfer payments are made, but after 2003 those who wish to collect their pension in cash at a post office will be able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is essential to modernise the Post Office and maintain its services and that it has a valuable role in replacing the commercial banks that are closing in rural areas. That could add to post offices' expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. One of the Government's objectives is to secure additional support for rural post offices to make the technological changes to enable them to compete effectively in the 21st century. I am pleased to tell hon. Members that the Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit to carry out a study of rural post offices and their network in Wales and elsewhere to ensure that they can contribute to securing both the future of rural post offices and the services that they provide in the 21st century. We must remember that consumers have a choice; some people prefer, or need, their payments to be made by ACT transfer.<br><br>
A range of issues have been mentioned by hon. Members and I shall go through as many as I can in the time available. I shall re-examine those issues that I do not have time to mention. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend gave a thoughtful speech on health expenditure. I acknowledge the points that he made; decisions are a matter for the Assembly, but within the context of the United Kingdom he can raise the issues that he mentioned with the English health Minister and with my Department.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North mentioned the children's commissioner and the Care Standards Bill. The Assembly is discussing those proposals. We hope to finalise suggestions for the Government to consider and the proposals will be made at an appropriate legislative opportunity when the Assembly has finalised its position. I hope that that helps my hon. Friend.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy and others mentioned the Local Government Bill, which focuses on individual consumers and their concerns and on the services that are provided. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said earlier, it is a matter for local people to pursue should they wish to do so, in a referendum both for the mayor and for potential changes in the management structures of local authorities. We have given the Assembly the power to vary the conditions of Cabinet forms and models so that they can introduce alternatives should they so wish.<br><br>
I was interested in the real and important issues raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Clwyd, West, for Vale of Glamorgan, for Presili Pembrokeshire, for Monmouth and by other hon. Members.<br><br>

Time is pressing and I cannot go into the issues raised in detail; I merely say that the Queen's Speech is part of the Government's programme for Wales in the 21st century. We have introduced investment and opportunity to people in Wales and, with the National Assembly for Wales, the United Kingdom Government will ensure that there is fairness, opportunity and enterprise for people in Wales. We shall do so in the face of the Conservative party, who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
would undo all that we have done in two and half years and will oppose everything in the Queen's speech.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Ordered,</i>
