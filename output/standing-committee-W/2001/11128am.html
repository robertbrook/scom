	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; I wish to call as many people as possible, so I ask hon. Members to ask brief supplementary questions and Ministers to provide concise answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked</i>—</p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>National Economic Development Strategy</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Wayne David (Caerphilly)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions have taken place with the First Secretary to ensure the effective implementation of the national economic development strategy. [16509]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the First Secretary regularly on a range of matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that positive response by my right hon. Friend. Does he agree that the indivisibility of the British and Welsh economies shows that the measures that the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced in his pre-Budget report, including new support for research and development, and widening the 10 per cent, corporation tax band for small businesses, will have an important impact on ensuring that the national economic development strategy in Wales is implemented effectively</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given me the answer to his own question, but I very much agree with him. We cannot distinguish between the success of the British and Welsh economies, in so far as the strength and stability of the economy of the United Kingdom has a good effect on the economy of Wales. I particularly welcome his point about research and development, because that is a central part of the national economic plan that the Welsh Assembly will debate in the forthcoming weeks and months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>New Deal</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mark Tami 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> If he will make a statement on the operation of the new deal in Wales. [16510]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new deal has been a success story in Wales. More than 81,000 people have benefited from the scheme and so far 42 per cent, have found new jobs. Last week I was in Caerphilly, where I presented the 25,000th youngster who had entered the new deal with a certificate to mark that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mark Tami</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response, which demonstrates the remarkable success of the new deal in addressing unemployment in Wales through investment amounting to some 30 million this year. Is he aware that the level of commitment by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Government has enabled Wales to achieve higher success rates in the new deal than Scotland or England</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell my hon. Friend that unemployment in his constituency is at a 20-year low. The north-east Wales district Employment Service is hosting a tailored pathway scheme to help 18 to 24-year-olds into work through the new deal. He is right to point out that in Wales we have had greater success than other parts of the UK. Indeed, of those who joined the programme and secured jobs, 42 per cent, have been successful in Wales, compared with 40 per cent, in England and 38 per cent, in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>New Deal (Over-50s)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What assessment he has made of the impact of the new deal for the over-50s in Wales. [16511]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for the Department for Work and Pensions, the Employment Service in Wales and the Wales new deal taskforce to assess the impact of the new deal for the over-50s in Wales. However, my officials regularly observe meetings of the new deal taskforce, and I shall attend one in Cardiff early in January.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tell my hon. Friend that the new deal for people of 50-plus in my constituency has been a great success There has been a 28 per cent, fall in the number of people over 50 who are unemployed, and 14 new placements have been made in the past month alone. That has been a big success with what was probably considered the most problematic group of unemployed people in the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more difficult group is the long-term unemployed, who are sometimes considered unemployable, and are very difficult to get back into work. Can we apply the same successful methods to employing that lost generation, who were so damaged by the Thatcher era</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell my hon. Friend that two positive new deal 50-plus events recently took place in his constituency, one of which attracted 200 participants and 20 companies. Morrisons held an event that resulted in the employment of 17 people, nine of whom had disabilities; three other people got jobs elsewhere. In Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, 82 people have joined the new deal through the 50-plus scheme, and work is continuing on that. I recently met members of the action team in Carmarthen who are pioneering important projects to find new and innovative ways of helping those over 50 get back into work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the extension of the new deal to the over-50s as an important addition to the package. Does the Minister accept that the real problem facing people in that category is age discrimination They have skills and abilities, and could easily fit into new jobs and have a better a role in the workplace if the Government outlawed such discrimination. Having disallowed a private Member's Bill on the outlawing of age discrimination, do the Government have plans to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
introduce legislation that outlaws age discrimination on the same basis as sex discrimination That would give the over-50s in Wales not only the new deal but the best deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the first part of the hon. Gentleman's question—that people who are 50-plus have found great difficulty in returning to work. The Government schemes have been positive measures and combat age discrimination to some degree. Before I came to this place, in my previous incarnation, I remember employing people who were 60-plus. They did good jobs and in our industry, that worked out successfully. It is important to take on board the need to ensure that those who are 50-plus are not written off, but are given a new chance. New deal plus is making a contribution to that; we have made a start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Post Offices</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the Assembly First Secretary concerning the future of post offices in the deprived areas of Wales. [16512]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend regularly meets the First Secretary to discuss a wide range of issues relating to deprived areas in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be aware that the money available for rural post offices in deprived areas in Wales is provided directly by the Department of Trade and Industry, but the 4 million available to urban post offices in deprived areas is part of the block grant to the Assembly. When he meets the First Secretary, will he impress on him the need for passing that money down to urban post offices in deprived areas such as Hubberston in Milford Haven, in my constituency</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, and I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will take those comments on board. Last November, a formal requirement was made that the Post Office maintain the rural network, and steps are being taken to avoid closures in both urban and rural areas. The latest figures from the Post Office show that closures in urban and rural Wales are slowing down considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that many post offices have arrangements with banks, so that bank facilities can be directly accessed, but that some, including NatWest, have not yet entered that scheme Will he do what he can to ensure that, at least in Wales, banks that are not yet involved are willing to participate on a trial basis</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall certainly do that. In my constituency I collaborated with NatWest, when it closed a branch, in transferring its services to the local post office. Across Wales there are far more post offices than banks, and we need to retain access to banking services if we possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen (Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that in January many members of the European Union, including Ireland, will join the single currency. Does he agree that there is an opportunity for post
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
offices in deprived areas such as the ferry ports of Holyhead and Pembroke, to take full advantage of that—through bureaux de change, for example That would also help post offices in the surrounding rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that the Post Office will respond as my hon. Friend says. When I recently visited Holyhead with him, I became aware that about 2.5 million visitors from the Republic of Ireland pass through it each year. It would be beneficial to the local economy if more of them could be persuaded to stop and use Holyhead services. We hope to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the fact that more than 100 post offices have closed in the past three years—and the importance, as the Minister said, of maintaining the network—and the fact that that affects Wales disproportionately worse than the rest of the UK because of the rurality factor, what initiatives are the Minister's office pursuing in the Welsh framework to maintain the important network for our communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In April to June this year, 12 post offices closed in Wales — two in urban areas and 10 in rural areas. The latest figures from 5 November show that the trend has begun to slow. My right hon. Friend and I will do everything we possibly can in discussions with our colleagues in the Assembly, working in partnership with the Administration there, to persuade the Post Office to take advantage of the initiatives that the Government have put forward. We will also work to fund the support, so that we can maintain the network. I am very conscious of how important it is to so many parts of rural Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just the fate of post offices in deprived areas, but the fate of post offices in general that concerns me. Can we ensure that the Government are not giving with one hand and taking with another Will the Minister give an assurance that no supplementary business rates will ever fall on any post office in Wales</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter not for me but for the Administration in the Assembly— but I can say that the Government are committed to maintaining the nationwide network of post offices. Indeed, we accepted all 24 recommendations of the performance and innovation unit report, which was published last year, and as a result 270 million of new investment will go into the service in the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Cardiff</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What consultations he has had with colleagues in other Departments with regard to Cardiff's bid to be European capital city of culture 2008. [16513]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed it with Ministers in the United Kingdom Government and with Ministers in the National Assembly for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. Does he agree with me, and with the "Productivity in the UK" report, which was published this month by the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, that there are strong links
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
between the economic performance of cities and their surrounding regions, and that recent academic work suggests cities can underpin the success of regional economies as a whole? In any discussions with his colleagues and other Departments, will he emphasise the fact that in recent years Cardiff has, as we all know, successfully held important sporting events such as the rugby World cup and the Network Q rally, and political events such as the European conference—and that it can also hold cultural events successfully if is given the chance Will he emphasise that point to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I will. My hon. Friend is right to draw the Committee's attention to the bid by Cardiff, our capital city, to become the European capital city of culture in 2008. Cardiff may soon be the British capital of rugby, if we do reasonably well, as we did last week—we may not have won, but it was not a bad match. As a vibrant capital city it has a unique profile, and it is also the capital of a country with a distinct cultural language. The Assembly and I—and, I am sure, the other members of the Committee—are backing the bid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell me what role the visual arts centre in Cardiff, and the $7 million of public money invested in that building, will play as a part of Cardiff's bid as the city of culture, to emphasise to our friends throughout Europe how popular the arts are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that this is a matter very close to my hon. Friend's heart, and he may rest assured that I will raise it with the Minister for Culture, Sport and Welsh Language in the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Donald Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we all know, Cardiff is a suburb of Swansea. Will the Minister therefore give a shout of surprised joy at the fact that in spite of the traditional rivalry between the cities, Swansea city council, on behalf of the citizens of Swansea, has pledged its total support for Cardiff s bid, so this really is an all-Wales effort?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do not agree with my right hon. Friend's first point, but I very much take to heart what he said about Swansea's support for Cardiff s bid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Audit Commission</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has held with the Audit Commission concerning its work in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to meet the Comptroller of the Audit Commission shortly, to discuss the full range of his organisation's work in Wales, including the fruits of the Audit Commission's strategic consultation paper, "Delivering Improvement Together", and its role in promoting best value in local Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. I am sure that the whole Committee will agree that the Audit Commission does invaluable work in independently assessing how public money is spent, and ensuring that we get good value for that public money. In my right, hon. Friend's talks with the Audit Commission, will he have time to discuss its document,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
"Changing gear", which was published in September? The document states that of the local authority services surveyed in England and Wales, in England 63 per cent, were likely to improve the level of service, whereas in Wales only 33 per cent, were likely to do so. Will he ask the Audit Commission what the problem is with local government services in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question but that I shall discuss that document and other matters with the Comptroller of the Audit Commission. I take my hon. Friend's point regarding comparisons to heart. On Monday, I met the Assembly Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communities, the chair of the Welsh Local Government Association and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. We discussed improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and delivery in local government services in Wales. The Assembly and the Government take that matter seriously, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regularly meet representatives from Welsh industry, including representatives from the steel industry, to discuss a range of issues affecting business in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) for the quiet and sensitive way in which he has sought to bring solace to the bereaved in the steel works community in south Wales, which stretches along the coastal belt and into the valleys. When I first worked in the steel industry in 1953, conditions were hellish and accidents were tragically common. There have been huge improvements in safety over the years, but when the inquiry is complete and we know the cause of the recent accident, will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State work to ensure that safety is the prime priority, and there are no rival considerations? I am sure that he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. My hon. Friend has a long history of involvement in the steel industry; indeed, he worked in it for many years. I also agree with his remarks about my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon, who did a tremendously important job in helping the tight community in Port Talbot to face its terrible tragedy. Some weeks ago I visited Port Talbot, and I assure my hon. Friend that when the inquiries are complete—the sooner, the better—I will examine them carefully. In the meantime, we sympathise with the families who have been bereaved and those who are ill, and we await the outcome of the inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The responsibility for reopening the livestock markets lies primarily with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales remains closely in touch with developments and is working with the Assembly Minister for Rural Affairs. Discussions are currently taking place with the wide-ranging interests that are concerned about the future of the livestock sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that there is a pressing need for markets to be opened, particularly for cattle? With exports restarting and prices beginning to rise, can he tell us the prospects for reopening the markets before Christmas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's welcome for the fact that the export markets are starting to open up again, because it is important that we renew the markets that we lost during the foot and mouth crisis. The Assembly recently published a future strategy for farming, which sets out its vision for the development of farming. I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about livestock markets, because in my constituency there are several hill farmers who are finding it difficult to continue their business. I have discussed the matter with the Assembly Minister for Rural Affairs, because auctioneers and others deliver valuable help to farmers and the farming community. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking that the markets will reopen by Christmas, but the matter is under constant review and we shall do everything that we can in our discussions with both DEFRA and colleagues in the Assembly to try to achieve that as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that many of the difficulties experienced during the foot and mouth campaign were a result of the extended chain of communication involving DEFRA, the Assembly and the people working on the ground? Does he also agree that decisions on the livestock market would be better taken by the Minister in Cardiff, having regard to advice received from local people and without the advice, and confusion, of DEFRA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are difficulties where there are longer lines of communication than would otherwise be acceptable, but the working relationships between Ministers in DEFRA and the Minister for Rural Affairs in Cardiff have been very close. They and their officials have met many times to try to solve the problems. There is an on-going discussion about the difficulties with lines of communication, but our first priority is to ensure that we eradicate foot and mouth disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[16517]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I regularly meet the National
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Assembly First Minister and the Minister for Health and Social Services to discuss the national health service in Wales. We cover specific subjects such as pharmacies when appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I urge my hon. Friend to push the issue of the availability of out-of-hours pharmacy services in south Wales? In my constituency, no pharmacy is open on bank holiday Mondays, at weekends, in the evening or through the night. That means that many people who have been to hospital and been told that they must get a prescription—for a seven or eight-year-old child, for example—have to make a 15 or 20-mile round trip to Nantgarw or Llantrisant to find an out-of-hours pharmacy. All the out-of-hours pharmacies in south Wales seem to be based in Tesco's and nowhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of my hon. Friend's sustained campaign on this matter. I think that he posed questions on it to my right hon. Friend during Welsh questions in the House in October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health authorities are responsible for approving pharmacists' contract hours. In the case of the Rhondda hospital that my hon. Friend talks about, Bro Taf health authority is in discussions with local health groups and NHS contractors to see whether the hours can be extended to give patients greater access to pharmacies. The matter needs to be resolved locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has been pushing us hard, and no doubt my right hon. Friend will give him every help and support when he discusses the subject further with the Assembly's Minister for Health and Social Services. This difficult problem is not confined to the Rhondda; it exists in many other valley communities. We are working to try to find a successful solution that enables people to access pharmacies at different times when they want to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[16518]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has been brief— but he will be aware that European Union receipts can be drawn down from the Intervention Board by the Countryside Council for Wales for Tir Gofal. The Treasury can claw that back from the Assembly. In other member states, however, European funds for similar schemes are used not to compensate central Government but to increase the budgets for those schemes. Wales is losing out to the tune of millions of pounds because of the Treasury clawback. What action will the Secretary of State take to ensure that funding for Tir Gofal in Wales is genuinely additional?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably wrong to use the term "clawback"; advance payment is a better description. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Countryside Council for Wales, which operates the scheme, allocates a grant at the start of the year to cover its full cost. That is to cover both the part that will ultimately be met by domestic taxation and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
element that will ultimately be covered by the European Union. That is an efficient way to proceed, because it allows the CCW to allocate its budget in full, without having to wait for the EU element to be claimed and processed. When, retrospectively, the EU contribution arrives, it is repaid to the Assembly, which in turn repays central Government. That is the normal arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[16519]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the PIU energy review advisory group and I regularly discuss the review and its impact in Wales with the Minister responsible for energy. In addition, a PIU seminar was held in Wales on 27 September to take the views of Assembly representatives, Assembly-sponsored public bodies and representatives of the energy industry in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that the aim of the PIU review is to set out a long-term strategy and policies, including a policy for renewable energy. Does he agree that that provides an excellent opportunity for additional jobs in the energy sector, and will he press the Minister responsible for energy to seek the views of Welsh Members of Parliament, particularly those whose constituencies have major employers in that sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sought to inform my contributions to the PIU discussions. I recently had meetings with Scottish Power and I was at Tower colliery on Monday, listening to the co-operative owners speak about the important role that they must play in the future of our energy supply. The PIU is gathering its final evidence, and a report will be sent to the Prime Minister and published before long. It would not be proper for me to comment on the contents, but I take note of my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that the Under-Secretary is on the review working party. He will know that Wales contributes 40 per cent, of renewable energy to the United Kingdom grid from wind energy, and that we have a huge potential for job creation. Looking forward to what the PIU report is likely to say, will he take the opportunity to reject the idea of any new nuclear power station in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be proper for me to make any commitment on that until the PIU report is published. When it has been published, people will be able to debate its contents and make submissions to the Government as appropriate. I note the hon. Gentleman's point about renewables. There have been problems with planning consent, and I hope that they will be addressed when the report is published. On the subject of nuclear power, it would not be appropriate at this stage for me to give any comment or commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my hon. Friend's visit to Tower colliery, he will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
aware that the next three years' production of coal has already been purchased by the Aberthaw power station. Will he assure the Committee that he will make representations to ensure that any review considers the strategic importance of older coal-fired power stations such as Aberthaw? That is especially important in relation to the security of the energy supply to south Wales industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take note of my hon. Friend's point. Indeed, I recommend a good debate held in the other place on cleaner coal technology about a week ago. I had some chance discussions last week with Lord Ezra, who made a major contribution to the coal industry and continues to take an active interest in its future. I am aware of the importance of coal to our economy in terms of our energy needs and supply. I will take my hon. Friend's points on board, and I believe that they will be reflected when the PIU report is published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary accept that the best way to reduce pollution is to reduce the energy requirement?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I will be taking part in a "Warmer Homes" event in my constituency in the next week—it is possible that other hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our visits to Wales over the summer, my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already had a response about sub-post offices. The Secretary of State will know that about 90 per cent, of unemployment in Wales is in the smaller and medium-sized business sector. Many people feel that more should be done to expand the sector, and yesterday's reference to simplifying VAT for that sector is a good move forward.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon.

Should we not welcome such simple innovations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we should. My hon. Friend has already touched on the question of post offices in more detail, and the £270 million that has been invested in post offices in the country. I know my hon.

It might be helpful if I remind Members of the timing of the debate. We have from now until 1 o'clock and then we meet again at 4 o'clock in room 10 but at 4 o'clock we will have a statement from the Secretary of State and there will then be some questions, if Members wish. The debate will resume after those questions until 6 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Pre-Budget Statement and its implications for Wales.</p></blockquote>
I shall be as brief as I can because I take your point, Mr. Griffiths, that we want as many hon. Members as possible to contribute to what the debate on what is an extremely important issue for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee last addressed Budget issues on 12 March in county hall in Cwmbran and much has happened since then. We have had a general election and the Labour party has returned a substantial majority. We have had the terrible events of 11 September in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, none of that has prevented us pursuing our objective of long-term prosperity for all citizens in Wales and the United Kingdom. We intend to achieve that in the next decade. Our aims are full employment, higher education for the majority of our young people, sustained improvements in our public services, a halving of child poverty with the intention of ending it altogether within a generation and an end to pensioner poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made good and steady progress over the last four or more years in this matter. We have not returned to those damaging cycles of boom and bust which we had for all those years under the Conservatives and because of the tough and difficult decisions that we have had to take we now have the lowest inflation for 30 years, the lowest long-term interest rates for 35 years and the lowest unemployment since 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That work is continued in the measures announced in the statement made yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. For us in Wales it will have its impact upon the Welsh people through the new constitutional arrangements upon which we voted in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
All those aims will be achieved through a partnership between the United Kingdom Government and the National Assembly for Wales. The pre-Budget report illustrates how, together, the Government, the Assembly and local government in Wales can transform the lives of Welsh women, men and children for the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On partnership, does the Secretary of State share my concern about the distribution of money in Wales? Would he care to comment on some examples of the problem? We are spending approximately £92 million of public money on the Millennium arts centre—a glorified opera house—in Cardiff bay, and we will provide another £2 million a year in subsidies for it. However, we have a Victorian theatre in Blaenau Gwent—you will know it well—that we are trying to convert into a high technology training centre for theatre skills. It will include workshops, a digital training centre, conference space, a recording studio and much more. However, we have not received the £1 million that is required to get the project off the ground. I remind you that £1 million is half the amount of the subsidy that will go to the glorified opera house in Cardiff bay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have stretched my tolerance a long way. I remind hon. Members to make brief interventions and not long speeches. I also remind hon. Members that use of the word "you" in this case is an attack on me, not the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prefer it that way round, Mr. Griffiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with my hon. Friend about the Millennium centre. It will be an enormous asset to our capital city and will improve its bid to become the European capital city of culture. However, I agree with his point about the theatre in Abertillery. I am aware of the situation—he and I met with the local authority—and he may rest assured that I will take it up with the relevant Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The devolution settlement was always about sharing responsibility, government and a vision for a better Wales. The White Paper that set up devolution discussed a new partnership between Parliament and the Assembly, the Assembly and Whitehall Departments, and Members of Parliament and Assembly Members. During the passage of the Government of Wales Bill, Member after Member who spoke in the debate on the Floor of the House referred to those partnerships. My predecessor, the then Secretary of State, Ron Davies said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The assembly's success will be judged, by and large, by whether it develops a good working relationship with the Westminster Parliament".—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 20 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 826.]</p></blockquote>
He was right. Incidentally, everyone realised and accepted that we could change lives in Wales through primary legislation made in this place; the 40 Welsh MPs play a vital role.

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
launching the valleys first initiative, which will bring Members of both Houses of the Westminster Parliament, the European Parliament and the Assembly together to talk about how we can best make connections with one another and co-ordinate our work. The aim is to deal with divisions and champion those who have the greatest needs: the people of our valleys. Does the Secretary of State think that that is a positive initiative, which will make the connections better?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the initiative, which is extremely positive. It is important that the Assembly, the House of Commons, local government and the European Parliament work together with the aim of ensuring that the problems that affect our people are dealt with. After all, there are only 3 million people in Wales, and they are represented at different levels of government. The 40 Welsh Members of the House of Commons represent them and have duties in this place, in the same way that Assembly Members have their duties. Of course, we all represent the same people, and the public are often confused by who does precisely what. If we work to achieve the aims of eliminating deprivation and unemployment, in the valleys and elsewhere, nothing but good will result. I congratulate my hon. Friend on that point.

The latest spending review granted the Welsh Assembly unprecedented resources to spend on health, education and other services. However, that is insufficient to bring about reform, which is why the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Bill and the Education Bill have specific clauses for Wales. Those clauses were negotiated with the Assembly before they were added to the Bill, but are still subject to scrutiny in the House and the other place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman talks about partnership. Will he explain why the Animal Health Bill was not discussed with the Welsh Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the drafting of Welsh clauses is evolving. Last year, we dealt with Bills differently. We learn as we go, and the relationship matures.

On Second Reading of the current health Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) wondered whether Members of Parliament have a meaningful role in legislating for Wales.

I am delighted that the draft Welsh NHS Bill will be scrutinised by the Assembly, and I hope, by some agreed method in the House, before it goes through the legislative process. That is the way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for referring to my comments. Under the constitutional arrangements, the Government negotiate Bills with the Welsh Assembly. Once negotiations are complete, and the Government have decided which Bills will come to the House, the Government are accountable to the House. What is the role of MPs in holding the Government to account if it is perceived that a Bill negotiated with the Assembly will pass unaltered? How can we make the Government accountable in that process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I respond to my hon. Friend's points, may I say how relevant that is to the pre-Budget report? We cannot improve public services in Wales without the necessary resources—the responsibility of the UK Government and the House, or without the necessary reform and change agenda. It is more complicated in Wales than in England—where resources are dealt with through the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, the Budget and the spending review and the reform and change agenda is dealt with by the House—because of devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have more draft legislation. The follow-on to the health Bill is a draft Welsh NHS Bill, which I hope will soon be placed before the House. It also has to go before the relevant Committee in the National Assembly. Any Bill presented to the House will obviously have been drawn up by the Government of the day and will express Government policy. The difference here is that we have to liaise with the Assembly so that the content of the Bill results from a partnership between the Assembly and the Government. Additionally, this place provides a further opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny, though we shall have to debate that more fully, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will meet the Assembly's Health and Social Services Committee next week to discuss the NHS Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred yesterday to reform and change in the health service, and the resources necessary to promote that process. That will be discussed with the Assembly's Committee and, in turn, with the House in an agreed way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After four and a half years of a Labour Administration, more people in Wales are facing longer NHS waiting lists, so who takes the blame—the Government because of insufficient resources or the National Assembly because of its mishandling of the NHS in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pretty clear about who is to blame—the Conservative Government. However, that provides a neat entry to the next part of my speech.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The thrust of the Chancellor's statement yesterday about reform of the health service—he referred to the Wanless report—was that in a sense we are all to blame over 40 or 50 years for underfunding the health service in comparison with services in other European and western countries. We have to decide how best to deal with the results of that underfunding—despite the extra £1 billion for the NHS in Wales in the previous spending review and despite the extra £1 billion for the NHS in the UK next year. A tremendous amount of money has been invested in the health service in Wales and the UK more generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that we are all to blame for underfunding the health service. Does he accept the Liberal Democrat point that successive Conservative and Labour Governments have vastly underfunded the NHS and that we are receiving a confession about it from Ministers only now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I am more used to going to confession than he is. I am not sure about the penance for what has been done over the years. Parties have largely had a consensus about the health service for many years, but we have dropped behind in comparison with other European countries. That has to be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of the extra £1 billion invested in the health service next year is £49 million for Wales. The Committee will know that it is for the National Assembly to decide how to spend it. I welcome the Wanless report and the consultation exercise, which allows the National Assembly to be consulted over the months ahead. The report refers to the devolved administrations and to the importance of recognising that health is now devolved to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The resource issues of course remain the responsibility of the UK Government. It is for us to decide through the block grant system how to finance the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we all welcome measures to tackle pensioner poverty in Wales. The winter fuel allowance is to stand at £200 a year for the remainder of the Parliament, which will benefit 460,000 households in Wales containing someone aged 60 or over. About 275,000 pensioner households will benefit from the new pension credit scheme. Pensioners on small occupational pensions who have moderate savings were disadvantaged but will now benefit from the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 2002, the basic state pension will increase by £3 a week for a single pensioner and £4.80 for a couple. In addition, the basic state pension is guaranteed to increase by at least £100 for a single pensioner and £160 a year for couples in 2003–04, and in future years by 2.5 per cent., or the level of the September retail prices index, whichever is higher. The tax credit system will benefit people in other ways; it will help families with children and those seeking work. Lone parent employment, for example, is over 50 per cent, for the first time in 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are modernising the welfare state and bringing Welsh people into work. We are paying money
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
through the credit systems into Welsh families rather than taking it away from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures complement the work of the National Assembly for Wales, as explained in the new document, "A Winning Wales", to which my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) referred. It is another example of our partnership in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to help the 390,000 people in Wales with low skills to improve their skills. We want to provide better training and to give incentives for enterprise and productivity in Wales; some of the measures announced by the Chancellor yesterday have a particular resonance and significance for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Budget 2002, we shall build on the research and development tax credit for small firms and extend it to all United Kingdom companies. Reductions in capital gains tax mean that the effective tax rate for higher rate taxpayers will become 20 per cent, for assets held for one year and 10 per cent, after two years. The extension of the enterprise management initiative, the share option schemes for managers, will help more small, innovative companies to recruit and motivate their key employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are reductions in taxes and red tape for small businesses. We confirm our intention to extend the 10 per cent, band of corporation tax. We are reducing VAT compliance costs by up to £1,000 for firms with a turnover of up to £100,000 and we are consulting on the Carter report on the provision of payroll services to new and small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) said, the significance of the 140,000 small and medium-sized businesses in Wales cannot be under-estimated; most people in Wales work in businesses of that size. The Chancellor yesterday gave those businesses hope by extending the Welsh economy in a positive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone will welcome the abolition of stamp duty payable on commercial and domestic properties under the threshold of £150,000 in the most deprived areas. More than 350 wards in Wales will benefit from that proposal, which affects every local authority area, especially Rhondda Cynon Taff, Caerphilly and the valleys. Rural areas and cities will benefit from the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are able to do those things for Wales and for the Welsh people because of the way in which we have managed the economy. We have a strong, stable economy; we have paid off the national debt, which crippled our country, and saved £8 billion in interest rates on national debt; £4 billion has been saved because we have got people into work instead of their lingering in the dole queues. Billions of pounds have gone into the national Exchequer and we can therefore withstand the impact of foot and mouth disease, and of the international crisis, which has meant that the impact has been far less severe on our country than on any other country in the western world, or in Europe. That means that our growth in the coming year will still be between 2 and 2.5 per cent. That is a remarkable achievement, by any measure, in the current economic climate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone accepts that the Chancellor will be spending more than the growth in the economy. Will the Secretary of State say whether that will be paid for by higher taxes or more borrowing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that we have been able to put billions of pounds into the health service and schools without raising income tax, for the reason that I have just outlined: strong, prudent and wise management of the economy. We took decisions in the first two years of office that might not have worked out, but have paid off. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear this morning on the "Today" programme that he does not rule out future tax increases. None of us can, and it would be foolish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is consensus that tax increases are necessary. The hon. Gentleman's party does not seem to be prepared to join that consensus, although it used to be in the good old days of Macmillan and others who, like the rest of the country, believed in the health service. The Wanless report considered all the other options, including social insurance, private insurance and private medicine, and came to the conclusion, with which most of us would agree, that we have to pay for a national health service from the public purse. That is the best way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put billions of pounds into the NHS, but increased technology, greater expectation and the fact that people are living longer mean that we will have to put in even more money in the years ahead. I would be tickled pink if the hon. Gentleman could tell me how his party would finance the NHS. People would be prepared to pay extra taxes if they thought that that was the way ahead. In the months ahead, we will listen to the ideas of the National Assembly and people in Wales of to how best to resource the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chancellor referred many times yesterday to the Wanless report, the author of which is his new best friend. Does the Secretary of State think that it is a new notion that the NHS should be paid for out of public funds? Why did it take a report from an academic to tell us that that is the reality? Given that we are at a 21-year low in public investment, is it not a bit of a sham to come up with the report at this stage? Should not the work have started five years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wanless is no academic. As far as I am aware, he was the chief executive of the National Westminster bank group. Perhaps the group has academics—I do not know. All I know is that he is well versed in finance and banking money, and is not necessarily the person who would tell us to pay for everything out of the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone was saying that the French and German health services were better than ours. It would have been wrong to come to the conclusion that the health service had to be paid for out of the public purse without considering other options. Let us consider other countries and how they finance their health services and indeed the health services under the devolved Administrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report examined not only why more resources are necessary now but why we will have to spend even more money in the future. It is important that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
engage in a public consultation exercise. I am sure that Plaid Cymru will take part in that exercise, and I am convinced that it probably agrees with the recommendations of the Wanless report. We must consider these matters in a balanced way by examining the options and seeing how best to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor touched on employment measures, and I will tell the Committee today about the Government's plans for further employment measures. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will give a statement to the House on that subject at 3.30 this afternoon, although obviously I cannot pre-empt what he will say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have withstood the pressures of the past few months in a way that is envied by other countries. Our economy has grown while others lagged behind. The measures of the report will help the United Kingdom and Wales become more competitive and enable us to secure a decent share of world trade—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am right in the middle of my peroration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I intervened. I suspected that the Secretary of State was getting a fair wind for his peroration, and I wanted to ask him a question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State name one measure in the pre-Budget statement that has not been previously announced and affects positively the environment? Does he agree that this is the least green Budget that the Labour party has ever produced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is wrong and if he reads the detail, he will see that there will be consultation on various environmental measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Announced previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether it has been announced previously, the review is up for consultation. That is the purpose of the pre-Budget report: to give people the opportunity to talk about the measures to which the hon. Gentleman referred. He knows that there are measures on environmental matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, 500,000 pensioners in Wales will see their lives improved, while our national health service, founded by Aneurin Bevin, will see the biggest improvement since its creation more than half a century ago. I therefore commend the report to the Committee and the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say first how saddened I am that the Welsh viewing public do not have the benefit of watching the Committee on television. [Hon. Members: "Why are you here then?"] I do not get out much. I am sure that the Committee would agree that, as the public are riveted with the proceedings of the Assembly and Parliament, the Committee would be a tremendous, albeit brief, alternative guide to our activities. The Welsh Grand Committee is important enough to warrant being televised, and it is a shame—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As we are on the subject, I should tell the Committee, so that it will be in fine fettle, that the Committee will be televised this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When people say that the Liberal Democrats cannot make a difference, they need only to see the impact that I have had in the first minutes of my speech. It is another triumph of democracy that my request has been acquiesced to in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good also that Welsh MPs get on so well, because the Room is so small that one could almost reach out and touch the Government. I hope that these intimate surroundings engender a greater degree of listening than has sometimes been the case, and it is in that spirit of listening that I seek to make constructive points, as I always do. I hope that the partnership that we share to make Wales a successful and thriving country means that ideas are sometimes adopted from across the Floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise the background of the economic woes in Wales. It is clear to us all, whether we admit it or not, that the problems in Wales were exacerbated during the dark years of the Conservative Government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] However much the Conservatives seek to criticise the present situation, we should remember that the facts speak for themselves. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] "Lib-Lab" is the extraordinarily powerful response coming from my left. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley has often accused the Liberal Democrats of cuddling up to Labour. That is understandable because no one wants to cuddle up to him. I hope that should he catch your eye, Mr. Griffiths, he will respond to the facts that I am using to provide a context to today's economic debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives presided over the two highest periods of unemployment in Wales: 185,000 in 1985 and 140,000 in 1993. Those were two shameful peaks that crippled the Welsh economy. The Conservatives decimated Welsh industries—mining and steel to name but two—and presided over the highest interest rate of 15 per cent, in 1992. I have heard many criticisms of the pre-Budget statement and the work of the Assembly on health, yet, under the Conservatives, waiting lists grew by 12,700 in Wales alone. The number of hospital beds fell from 23,500 in 1979 to 15,500 in 1997, and prescription charges rose in the same period from 20p to £5.25. Conservatives are not in a position to give lessons on the Welsh economy to the rest of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will the Liberal Democrats take the blame for what is happening in the NHS in Wales? The hon. Gentleman's party is part of the Administration. It is pointless talking about what happened before 1997. We have had two general elections since then, and more people are now waiting longer for NHS treatment in Wales. Perhaps it is time that he says, "Sorry."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Conservatives can say that kind of irresponsible thing, because they have no chance whatever of forming the Government. In fact, at the current rate of expansion of Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Members in the House of Commons, they will achieve a majority of one in 2822 AD.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Liberal Democrats are the fourth party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says.
I provide the statistics to assure the House that anyone who does an informed investigation into the performance of the Conservative party will be sure to find that its strategy did not achieve its policy objectives. Moreover, the strategy has not significantly changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the situation in Dyfed Powys. It is a further example of the way that the NHS in Wales suffered under the Conservatives. The health authority had no debt at all before the 1991 Tory reforms but by 1997 it faced a massive £23 million debt. That is a direct result of Tory mismanagement of the NHS during those years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a sensible point, which leads to my response to the question of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley about who is in charge in Wales. He is correct, and I am glad that he acknowledges that there is a Liberal Democrat-Labour Government in Wales. It seeks to put right some of the ills that I have described and will do all in its power to achieve the reforms and investment that the health service badly needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Liberal Democrats did not cause the problem—that is why I intervened on the Secretary of State earlier—but perhaps they will provide the solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for his modest claims on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. Before they provide the solutions to all the health care problems of Wales, perhaps he would provide the solution to a conundrum that I have been working on since last week. Would he explain to the Committee why the Liberal Democrats in this House voted against Second Reading of a Bill that included clauses that their partners in Wales had proposed? Were they consulted about the means of delivery, and how do they propose that legislation can be pushed through this House if Liberal Democrats do not vote for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to provide a lesson in parliamentary procedure to the hon. Gentleman. Let me assure him that we consulted our Assembly colleagues, took advice and agreed on how my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) and I would vote. We had many concerns about the Bill with respect to the United Kingdom as a whole and decided that the best way to express them was by voting against the Bill. In fact, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the chance to clarify that. [Hon. Members: "But you haven't."] The appropriate place to improve the Bill is in Standing Committee. That is exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) is doing in trying to amend the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we will take advice from our Welsh Assembly colleagues about what we do on Third Reading. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
important benefits could accrue from the Bill; I will keep him posted about what we plan to do at that stage. I thank him again for his assiduous observations of the activities of the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Liberal Democrats had answers to the difficulties in the NHS. Perhaps he might offer an answer to this problem, for which the Liberal Democrat coalition in Cardiff is responsible. There is a 900 per cent, increase in the waiting time for first out-patient appointments; 59,919 people had been waiting more than six months as of 30 September. Though he is correct in some of his criticisms of the Conservatives, that is down not to the Conservatives but to the Administration in Cardiff. How would he improve that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Primarily, of course, these are resource matters. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) will respond fully to that point—thankfully, after lunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to explain the historical context because it is important. It is all very well condemning the Conservatives for their inaction, but we should remember that once in government the Labour party was committed to carrying on with the very spending plans that it condemned in the run up to the 1997 general election. Although the Liberal Democrats were frustrated by the Conservatives' poor performance in Wales, we were equally disappointed when Wales' economic woes were not addressed in the first two or three years of a Labour Administration who promised more of the very economic policies that had brought many Welsh industries to their knees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a kind of double-talk. Time and again, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister said that there was nothing that they could do and that all the problems had been caused by the Conservatives, but the Government could have taken a different approach. That is why Labour must take some blame for the problems that are at the heart of the health service's woes, including waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his pre-Budget statement, the Chancellor makes clear the need for serious investment in the health service, and that is to be applauded. As he said, we must have a serious long-term review. We must not be dogmatic about it—we must consider all options. Although I am sceptical about public-private finance initiatives, I accept that we must investigate them in a pragmatic and objective way to see whether they can deliver results. However, as we move on from Conservative plans and three wasted years of the Labour Administration, it is important to focus on the outcomes that we want for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some specifics in the pre-Budget statement have already been mentioned, and I shall briefly deal with a few other points. It is clearly right to try to simplify the taxation system and VAT for small businesses, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said. However, I should give one warning. We have heard such things before, but implementation has let the strategy down. We have observed Ministers' high
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
ambitions to simplify the taxation and red tape regime, only to discover that the regime has been changed rather than simplified. Ministers must have the courage to empower civil servants to reduce bureaucracy, even if doing so jeopardises certain safeguards. In general, such simplifications to the administration process are not made because civil servants spot that they will give rise to possible loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some measures are being introduced, one assumes, to avoid or reduce the danger of recession. That is a high ambition, but it is worth noting that Britain has something of a two-speed economy that is split between a manufacturing sector in recession and a reasonably buoyant, if slowing, services sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing in Wales has suffered. We all know about the Corus debacle, and Alcan, the aluminium manufacturer, has also suffered greatly. There are various reasons, and I will come to the exchange rate in a moment. We need to recognise that Wales has been particularly hard hit in those ways. The pre-Budget statement is too late for the jobs that have been lost, but we can only hope that, if we make the Government's intentions in the statement clear, other companies on the ropes can plan through the dark times until some of the fairly laudable initiatives there take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats have, on balance, been more in favour of the single currency and Britain's entry to it than other parties represented here. That is on the basis not of a deep principle, but of an economic judgment. We feel that the benefits of entering far outweigh the costs and that jobs in Corus and elsewhere might have been saved had we entered the euro at the right level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exchange rate is all-important. To enter the euro at too high a level would be to re-live the experiences of the late '80s when we entered the exchange rate mechanism at the wrong level. It would, however, be helpful if the Chancellor could go even further than he went yesterday and put his cards on the table as a supporter of us entering the single currency. For some individuals, perhaps even in this Room, that is anathema. The word euro can be like a cross to a vampire. There is huge scepticism about it, but I strongly encourage the Government to speed up. Every month that goes by puts more jobs in Wales at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wayne David 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that consideration of entry to the single currency is realistic only when economic conditions are right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not. We could have a debate now on whether we would enter at that point. We could decide that we want, positively and proactively, to drive this country's thinking towards a yes vote in a referendum. I am not sure where the hon. Gentleman stands on the euro, but if he is simply making the rather more trivial point that we should enter when the economic conditions are right, I agree. The hon. Gentleman nods at that, so I can see that we violently agree. I am happy with his support for my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The Chancellor must recognise that there is scepticism about public-private partnerships in many quarters, not least because of the disastrous effects of privatisation, which we have recently seen most ignominiously with Railtrack. I know that PPPs are slightly different, but they are in the same family of political initiatives. The Liberal Democrats respect the importance of looking at all the options, including for the health service. It would be dogmatic not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must make sure that there is a clear value for money test. For example, many people find it hard to see how there can be such improvement in efficiency that it more than offsets the drain from the economy or investment that is required to pay profits or returns to shareholders. That kind of question would come up in a value for money investigation. I do not want to go much further on PPP, because other people, including my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, will want to comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will pass on my thanks to the Government for the money that has been committed to helping rural areas that have been badly hit by foot and mouth disease. It is tragic that the rural economy in Britain, let alone Wales, has been brought to its knees due to circumstances entirely beyond its control. If the money comes through quickly, it may be substantial enough to make a difference, but I am afraid that many smaller farms are ready to close or will close soon. The money must come through speedily to protect those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I request the Secretary of State to discuss with appropriate Ministers in the Welsh Assembly how best we can support a strategy to protect family and small farms, which are the backbone of many rural communities in Wales and which have often suffered most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the future and the partnership to which the Secretary of State rightly alluded, all political parties have been finding their feet in the new arrangements between the Welsh Assembly and Westminster and there is still suspicion and perhaps tension between the two bodies. We must be honest about that. If devolution is to work, we must be proactive in developing the partnership instead of reactive, believing that it will develop whether or not we play a positive role. For example, it would be extremely helpful in the context of yesterday's Budget if we could revisit the Barnett formula positively and co-operatively with a true dialogue between Assembly Members and Members of Parliament. We could perhaps have a formal meeting to discuss how best to ensure equity for Wales, where the GDP per head is 89 per cent, of the United Kingdom average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
criticism of the barriers to the evolving relationship cannot be put at one door or another. It is human nature that when power relationships change, there are inevitably frictions as people get used to the new arrangement. It is incumbent on us, as much as on the Assembly, to assume a co-operative and positive position regarding the relationship between Cardiff and Westminster and then to ask how best can we make that partnership work, not for political parties or politicians, but for the people of Wales. That is not implausibly idealistic and if we do not do that the people of Wales could rightly criticise us for not making a new structure work when the majority of us in this Room encouraged them to vote for it in the referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was generous in his comments to the Government on the £2.7 billion for the rural economy following foot and mouth disease. Perhaps I should disabuse him about the figure. The pre-Budget report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government acted decisively to contain and eradicate FMD … spending an additional £2.7 billion".</p></blockquote>
There is no new money. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has fallen into the trap again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see the strong feelings that the hon. Gentleman's comment engendered. It is my view that there is some prospect of more support for rural areas, but I shall put down a marker for the record. If the hon. Gentleman is correct and it is another smoke and mirrors trick on the part of the Government to fool not only us, but the public, it would be a very sad day, given the importance of the rural economy for the overwhelming majority of Wales, geographically speaking. If the Minister wants to intervene, I shall be happy to give way, although he implied that the matter will be covered in his wind-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the need to build the relationship between Cardiff and Westminster, Liberal Democrats have tried to be true to the promise to try a new kind of politics that most of us made at the time of the referendum campaign for the Welsh Assembly. Although, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley reminded us, it is easy to criticise when one is not in government, Liberal Democrats are now in government in Wales, and we must act responsibly in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Picking up on the comments of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas), I hope that we can find new ways to resolve the great problems in the health service, so that real money goes into real investment and unnecessary parts are streamlined. More money must go not only to the front line, but into creative ways of preventing illness in the first place through preventive measures and improving quality of life at home. That is a big challenge that will take years to achieve, owing not least to the underfunding that I tried to pin on the Conservative and Labour parties.

	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
In seeking to make this new partnership and new kind of politics work, I hope that the Government realise that we do not want the smoke and mirrors to which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy alluded. We want them to tell it like it is. If the Chancellor really meant it yesterday when he said that the Government might start being more honest about tax if they need more tax-raising powers to put money into the health service, that is welcome. Let us not pretend that indirect taxation, which the Government love so much, is fairer than direct taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrats have tried consistently to be honest about how we would raise the money that we wish to spend. We said that we would put a penny on income tax to put £2.5 million into education. We said that we would put l0p on the top rate of income tax for those earning £100,000 a year or more—in this Room that applies only to the Ministers—and put that money, together with the revenue from a small increase in duty on cigarettes, directly into the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My appeal to the Committee is that we should discuss these matters positively, encourage Ministers to be honest about tax and recognise that the people of Wales will feel that we are taking their needs seriously only when we treat them with respect by telling them the truth about the price tag, as well as the investment, that is needed to achieve the kind of Wales that we want in five or ten years' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Unfortunately, the technology does not allow us to do that at the moment, but I live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was characteristically over-generous to the main Opposition party in suggesting that it might, on present trends, achieve power in a century or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eight centuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be much longer than that. He has clearly not looked at the most recent trends. There was a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s when we all believed that government parties could not win by-elections. In one of two recent by-elections, the main Opposition party actually lost some of its share of the vote, which is almost unprecedented in recent times. Then there was the triumph in Swansea, a place not unconnected with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, where the party gave a remarkable performance, hailed as a fight back by the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, in which it hung on to its deposit by a margin of 0.24 per cent. That may console it, but it lost ground on its previous record deplorable performance. We cannot look forward to a time—even if we consider when asteroids will be pummelling us— when we shall see a Conservative government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The pensions question is appropriate for someone of my age. From 1980 onwards, successive Conservative Governments destroyed the pensions-earnings link and promised to make it up in other ways. Every year pensioners were cheated by a salami cut in the real value of their pensions because those Governments ensured that increases were at the basic rate of inflation, rather than at the higher rate. I pay tribute to the Government for their treatment of pensioners, especially in the past 12 months. We were late starting, but we have more than made up for the shortfall during our period in government. The £200 that has been given will be greatly appreciated, and so will the rises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motto of the Bettws school in my constituency is "Nid da lie gellir gwell"—there is no good that cannot be improved upon. If we examine the settlement, which includes television licences, for pensioners it is far better both than previous settlements and than if the link had been restored. However, how can the Chancellor resist restoring that link? He has made it clear that had that link been restored in the first year in which it was possible for the Labour Government to do so—1998—pension rates would now be £78.25 for a single pensioner and £125 for a couple, which would be an extra £2.75 per week. The situation in the national insurance fund is such that that is readily affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One factor that has interestingly left the political consciousness is that the national insurance fund lost £1 billion last year, and it will lose a similar sum in future years, because the Government decided to reduce the contributions made by employers as a trade off for green taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I have discussed these matters in private on many occasions. The reason why the Chancellor does not want to restore the link, even though he is paying out more money with this settlement, is the same reason why all major parties do not want to. It is not because it is unaffordable now; it is because it will be unaffordable in 2020 and 2030. My hon. Friend has explained that because of his pensionable age that may not concern him, but it will concern some Members in the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend knew the effort it took to contribute to my pension during 30 years in the steel industry, he would realise that I plan to live for ever. I plan to live way beyond the period suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an old-fashioned argument. Interestingly, it did not arise in the pensions debate that took place here last month. The hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) has written a splendid book called "The Age of Entitlement", which is a page-turner that all members of the Committee will find enthralling— Mr. Two Brains was using his better brain when he wrote it. One of its chapters is entitled "The myth of the demographic time bomb". He examines the demographic time bomb, which will exist with the baby boomers for a brief period beginning in 2030, and accurately states that it was used as a device by the Conservatives in the 1980s—1985 and 1986—to wreck the state earnings-related pension scheme. That excuse was used to say that pensions were unaffordable in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
distant future; they are not. That is now demonstrated now as myth. We know the generations and number beyond 2020 or 2030. Pensions are affordable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct one of the hon. Gentleman's comments. A major party does support restoring the link between average earnings. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Have a good look because that party is standing here. If the hon. Gentleman can hear me, would he agree that the collapse in annuity prices provides even more of a reason to return to the basic principle of a collective state pension paid from national insurance contributions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Paul Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have taken that intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One great worry about pensions is annuities. At present, if someone found himself with an annuity of £100,000, it would bring him an income of about £6,000 a year, which is a great shock. Between 1990 and 1994—I remember the dates because of an Adjournment debate—the value of annuities dropped by 35 per cent. One could imagine the reaction if any other pension had dropped by such an amount. The fact that the Conservatives popularised those money purchase schemes when they damaged SERPS and got so money people into them while taking them out of good-value occupational schemes, means that those people will end up, in their retirement years, with a pension that is a gamble. They will have to buy an annuity that is of poor value now and may get worse in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the House recognises that great worries about pensions exist for all groups. At the moment, there is a balance in the national insurance fund that is way above what is necessary to restore the link in the foreseeable future. Further answers from the Department have pointed out that the balance in the fund was £8.2 billion in 1998. The actuaries latest projections show that by March 2003, the unneeded surplus—that above any unexpected increases in employment—will have risen to £12.2 billion, an increase of £11.15 billion or nearly twice what it would take to restore the earnings link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair for the Chancellor to say that he will increase the amount by the sum that he announced yesterday, and by inflation, which he has to do anyway. However, the question is, what level of inflation does he use to increase it? I do not want to emphasise the gap in years between hon. Members, but the main anxiety of those who are now in their retirement years is that they will see a fall in the value of their money. They are not asking for a continued increase, but for what was in the manifesto, on which all Labour Members fought in the 1997 election, which said that we will allow pensioners to share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nations—that was how we put it. To achieve that, we must go back and restore the link and that is now affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another crisis in pensions is that some are retiring with poor money purchase schemes. They have been taken out of good value final salary schemes, which pay out well. Also, a huge group of people in their 40s and 50s did not join their occupational schemes and
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
were allowed to opt out, which was a foolish mistake. Many others have gone into poor value personal pension schemes—Equitable Life is just the first of the pension vultures to have come home to roost, there will be many more. The new stakeholder pension scheme that we introduced, which offers great value, was negotiated by the Government at extremely low cost: it has a charge of 1 per cent. Commercial pensions have been ripping off people for many years with charges far in excess of that. Of course, 1 per cent, a year will build into a considerable sum over the life of a pension, but the scheme has not been taken up by many of those on low or medium wages, for whom it was intended. The ability to buy stakeholder pensions for their infant grandchildren was a great and unexpected boon to grandparents. It is a very good value investment and a far more effective way of helping children than showering them with Christmas presents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in their 20s and 30s are not interested in pensions. Those hon. Members who have tried to persuade staff to join the House of Commons free pension scheme will know how difficult it is to convince anyone in their 20s that they will eventually grow old and need a pension. They are convinced that they are immortal, and the only way to secure pensions for young people is to establish a compulsory scheme that is part of the taxation system and that enjoys the security and good value of a state scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am also pleased to be the first Opposition speaker in this debate. It would be churlish of me not to begin by welcoming some items in the pre-Budget statement, although in that respect I shall be a little briefer than the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of announcements were indeed very welcome. Reference has been made to the simplification of VAT rules for small businesses, and the attempt to create a level playing field for the domestic haulage sector is particularly welcome, not least in my constituency. Moves to strengthen community amateur sports clubs will prove very valuable throughout Wales, as will the reduction in duty on beer produced by smaller brewers. As a member of the interparliamentary beer group, my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who is not in his place, would doubtless welcome that development. [	<i>Laughter</i>.] Are they open already?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion said, the problem with the pre-Budget report is that many of its proposals were announced in exactly the same way at the time of the spring Budget, or have merely been put out for consultation. In other words, they will be announced again and we will have the same conversation during the next debate on these matters. The Chancellor's statement was not so much pre-Budget as re-Budget: a rehashing of proposals that we have already heard about.

	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
One genuinely new item was the announcement of an extra £1 billion for health. We all heartily welcome any extra investment in our beleaguered health service, but according to the Government's figures, this year they have underspent on health by £0.5 billion, and on education by £ 1.4 billion. No wonder they can afford to spend an extra £1 billion on health next year. If they continue at their current rate, this year they will underspend by £11.4 billion. Given that current underspend is some £6 billion, the Chancellor had even more room to add to that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fundamental to investment in public services is the need to call a halt to the Treasury's confidence trick, which has persuaded us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. It is important that we do not underspend, but that applies to the devolved Administrations as well as to the Government.

I was referring to the level of spending on public services. Hon. Members will be aware that UK education spending as a proportion of GDP last year was at a 14-year low. That was meant to be the threefold priority of the Government's first term. Hon. Members will also be aware that the Institute for Fiscal Studies report at the end of last month showed that the Government had reached a 25-year low in the level of public investment as a proportion of GDP. It was down to 1.7 per cent, of GDP compared with 8.9 per cent, in 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not a reflection on increasing GDP in this country, rather than education spend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to point this out, but I was referring to a percentage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can have an elementary lesson in mathematics outside the Committee. I am not talking about the absolute amount, but about the proportion. The proportion of GDP that we are spending on public investment has collapsed by 7.2 per cent, since the Wilson Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons for that is that now much less is spent on paying unemployment benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but I was making a specific point. Government investment as a proportion of GDP has collapsed to its lowest level in 25 years—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] There is clearly a lot of interest in this issue and I will happily copy the report to hon. Members. Government investment in housing in 2000 was negative for the first time on record. Public investment in health collapsed from 0.3 per cent, of GDP in 1991 to 0.01 per cent, last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clearly a trick and one that we have heard before from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who had to apologise to the House when he tried to imply that percentages of GDP being invested in Wales had fallen. The implication is that spending has not gone up, but it has risen dramatically as a direct result of the growth of the economy in the past four years brought about by such a successful Government. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would not knock investment in public spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that I am trying to mislead the Committee, but are not we all agreed that if there is growth in the economy it should be reflected in investment in health and education? The public sector needs to be adequately supported in line with economic growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we are grateful for the Government's change of heart following the Wanless report. France spends 3 per cent more of GDP on health than Britain. That is a staggering amount. Germany spends 50 per cent, more on health and has twice as many doctors. It goes far wider than that. Britain's European partners spend two to three times more on railways. State pensions are generally twice the level of those in the United Kingdom. I am as keen as any hon. Member to develop an all-party consensus. We need to spend more and address progressive taxation. We have made proposals to abolish the upper limit on national insurance contributions—that would raise £5 billion a year—and to introduce a new rate of tax for higher earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those steps would have been welcome in the pre-Budget report, which could also have included other measures that would have been useful to Wales. For instance, the Treasury might have abandoned its rules on public investment, which lump together real investment in hospitals, homes and transport. That unfortunately represents a small proportion of GDP, with cyclical borrowing. It has a real impact on the Assembly, as the Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communities conceded only last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had many debates on the Barnett formula and I do not intend to go into detail on that now. However, we need a serious debate on it because, in the next 10 years, the Barnett squeeze—a term coined by economists—will lead to the increase in the rate of funding for health and education in Wales being less than that in England. We must debate a needs-based formula for Wales.

To cite the Chancellor, the Assembly must have the right to borrow to invest. Before the general election, several English cities asked for the right to borrow via a regional bond. It was announced at the Labour party conference that local authorities will be allowed to borrow. Local authorities in England will soon have tax-raising powers and the right to borrow, whereas the National Assembly for Wales—the democratic body that represents the Welsh nation—will have none of those powers. If we are to empower the Assembly to deal with the social and economic problems of Wales, we must grant it similar discretionary powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I should like to move on to the vital issue which our constituents expect us to discuss this morning. The real issues facing small businesses and communities across the length and breadth of Wales are important. The biggest disappointment in the pre-Budget report was that we gained virtually nothing in response to the National Assembly for Wales' submission of an action plan on investment, published this Monday. I had assumed a degree of coordination between the office of the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Assembly. The Secretary of State referred to working in partnership; if this is evidence of partnership, I am afraid that its success has been weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly published an action plan demanding eight separate tax incentives, which are allowed under derogations of the European Commission for objective 1 areas, but there has been no delivery. That is bad news for many of our communities in west Wales and the valleys. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report, commissioned earlier this year and also published on Monday, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If Wales is to tackle its very real structural problems it must maximise the opportunities afforded it under the Objective 1 status. This requires a radical rethinking of incentives."</p></blockquote>
The derogations under objective 1 status provided a real opportunity to shift the focus of support to indigenous businesses and a package of regionally enhanced incentives for communities in west Wales and the valleys. On Monday, the First Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wales has greater needs for enhanced tax incentives than most other parts of Britain. That is why we have been pushing hard for the Chancellor to include them in his pre-Budget Report."</p></blockquote>
Either the First Minister was not pushing hard enough, or the Chancellor has been obdurate in his response. I have been asked several times whether National Assembly and Treasury Ministers have meetings. It was made clear in the National Assembly on 22 November that they do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman recognise and welcome the fact that enterprise and small businesses in Wales will benefit from the measures that the Chancellor will introduce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come on to that. As the First Minister said, Wales has greater needs for enhanced tax incentives. We are a special case because of our social and economic circumstances. The European Commission recognised that when it awarded us objective 1 status. It is a great shame that the Government are not prepared to recognise that— [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I can understand why hon. Members are angry if they share my anger at the Chancellor's failure to address the issue. This could have been a real chance to improve the offer that we could provide, and not only to inward investors in indigenous companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are two years into the programme, and we have wasted the opportunity. That is incredibly sad for all of us in the House. There has been a wave of job losses throughout industrial areas. We also have the lowest rate of business start-ups, and little research and development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree, despite all his doom and gloom, that Wales is now seen as having a buoyant economy and a positive outlook? A certain Dafydd Wigley said that just the other week. I wish that the hon. Gentleman would adopt the same approach and stop talking Wales down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say. I have worked all my life in economic development and no one is more committed to building a more successful economy and reversing decades of economic decline in Wales. I hope that he will accept and appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is Dafydd Wigley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dafydd Wigley is one of my friends in politics, as the hon. Gentleman knows. There are points of light in the Welsh economy, but the overwhelming impression is appalling. Welsh GDP growth has collapsed since 1995. We must consider some serious issues. The UK regional index of competitiveness was published last week. It showed that the divide between Wales and London with regard to competitiveness increased by more than 30 per cent between 1998 and last year. That shows that the economic performance of Wales has fallen off incredibly in a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that three-year period, of the 22 local authorities in Wales, only Monmouthshire is performing above the UK average in terms of competitiveness. The competitive performance of 18 of the 22 local authorities has fallen. It is gratifying to note that of the four improving areas, two—Gwynedd and Rhondda Cynon Taff—are Plaid Cymru local authorities that have been widely praised for their innovative economic development strategies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that during the past year, underspend in Rhondda Cynon Taff has been worse than in any other local authority in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall that certain financial problems had to be dealt with. To be fair, that was before the hon. Gentleman's time. I regret to inform the Secretary of State that the biggest fall in competitive performance in the index of local competitiveness was in the constituency of Torfaen. Out of 173 local
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
authorities in the United Kingdom, six of the bottom 10 are in Wales and they are all represented by Labour Members. I regret to say that the most uncompetitive of all is Merthyr Tydfil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman deliberately exaggerating and misleading us with his use of statistics? He talked about the Welsh GDP having collapsed in recent years. The GDP of Wales has been growing and he knows it but he is trying to suggest it is collapsing by comparing it with other regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would he agree with the conclusion in the "Productivity in the UK" report issued by the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry this week that the size of differentials and the relative ranking of regions in the United Kingdom have been consistent since the 1920s?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need the Assembly and local authorities to work effectively. The hon. Gentleman abuses statistics by taking a single local authority over a short period of time. The figures might be due to one local factor. That is an absolute misuse of statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that it is high time that we realised the gravity of the economic situation in Wales. It is not me saying this. I have regular conversations with academic economists throughout the university of Wales. He mentions the 1920s and he is quite right to do so because this is the worst five-year period in terms of GDP growth since then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolute nonsense. How can he describe the last five years of GDP growth in Wales as the worst since the 1920s? Will he now withdraw that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely not. I have no idea what figures the hon. Member for Cardiff, West is looking at for GDP growth. Yes, GDP is growing but the rate of growth has collapsed. The rate of GDP growth is far lower now than it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:No, it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I will be happy to have a conversation with the Minister about economic statistics at some other time. The prosperity gap between Wales and the south-east of England is growing. Unless that fundamental factor is realised, we will not have the debate that we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will we address the growing chasm between the regions in the northern half of the United Kingdom and those in the prosperous south-east? The business proposals of the pre-Budget report are aimed at the knowledge economy of the south-east of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give a few examples. We got research and development tax credits for large businesses. Where are those large business? We will look with interest in years to come to ascertain the areas that benefited most from the tax credits. Of course, they will be the regions that are already doing well. That applies to the proposals on intellectual property. The research and development tax credit is volume-based, not incremental, and it will also help large businesses and
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
widen the gulf between Wales and the south-east of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax credits are universally available, but we need a regional policy whereby tax incentives are targeted at areas of greatest need. The Government claim that they are targeting them in their welfare policies. In the context of welfare benefits, tax credits are aimed at the most needy, but when it comes to business, the opposite applies. We get universal tax credits that are available throughout the United Kingdom, instead of targeting areas for operating aid as my party, the National Assembly for Wales and the First Minister demanded. In economic terms, this was a Budget for the south-east of England. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] That is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We listened with interest to the Chancellor's comments on a new regional policy. Some of us were initially heartened because we had been calling for its revival for many years. However, when we looked at the details, we realised that it was only a review. A taskforce will probably be set up and a superannuated banker will issue a report and tell us that the north-south divide is disappearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night, I did some research in the Library on the levels of regional assistance under this Government. Taking regional selective assistance, regional enterprise and innovation grants together, the total spend on regional policy in Wales almost halved between 1998–99 and last year; it went down from £83,276,000 to £48,358,000 in one year. That is a 45 per cent, cut in regional assistance available to Welsh companies. However, at the same time, regional selective assistance for the south-east of England increased by 35 per cent. The new regional policy favours the already prosperous regions of the UK. It is not a regional, but an anti-regional policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have given way already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I greatly welcome the statement in the report that there will be an economic impact study of all departmental expenditure across the UK. For many years, we have said that there is a hidden subsidy within departmental expenditure, certainly for the south-east of England, and we will welcome the result of the review. We ask the Government to consider relocating public administration to regions such as Wales. That was done in previous eras, when the Royal Mint and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency were relocated. We hope to build bridges with all hon. Members to maximise pressure for decentralistion of public administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members will refer to some of the welfare changes; one omission struck me—the £1.4 billion social fund, which, as many hon. Members know, is a lifeline for the poor. The Select Committee on Social Security said earlier this year that the fund was working against the Government's key aim of reducing child poverty. In opposition, Labour promised to replace the fund with something bigger and better but they have not done so. After five years, the budget for grants has fallen in real terms. Until benefits are adequate, there will continue to be a need for help with sudden or expected costs. The social fund
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
is a key issue because it is a finite fund, which often runs out of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting sectarian politics aside, we need to have a serious debate on issues that affect the Welsh economy. I would welcome a genuine commitment by the Government to a regional economic policy and I would work with them on that. I welcome the statement made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard), who is not in his place at the moment, about creating a forum for debate about the valleys, but I respectfully suggest that it needs to be a cross-party debate. On all those issues, including social and economic development, what unites us in our fundamental motivation and aspirations for society is far more important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am just winding up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What unites us is far more enduring that anything that divides us. If we are serious about making connections, we must put the valleys first and the parties second. We need a serious debate, and I look forward to engaging with hon. Members in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the concern of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire about being available to speak when television cameras were on. I know that he was keen on it. He was perhaps thinking that we could have an edition of "Ready, Steady, Speak"—I saw one of his most recent appearances on television. Perhaps we could bring in new innovations. We could hold up red tomatoes for Labour speeches and green peppers for Plaid Cymru. I could not think of a blue food so I am glad that the Tories have gone. We could have yellow bananas for the Liberal Democrats, which the hon. Gentleman could no doubt use to bake a media tart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement and praise him in particular for the macroeconomic position. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) took pleasure in going through the minutiae of statistics and picking his periods carefully to fit his thesis. The most fundamental factor for people in Wales is the macroeconomic underpinning of the economy. The position in which we find ourselves in these times of economic uncertainty around the world is remarkable. We have record low inflation and unemployment, and that applies to Wales as well as to anywhere else. We have record low interest rates and the highest projected growth of any of the G7 nations. That is the reality of our economic position and the sort of thing that economic text-books used to claim was impossible. We were told that we could not have low inflation and low unemployment, or high growth and low interest rates at the same time, but that is what we have. We are in a virtuous circle due to the effective management of the economy by the Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Macroeconomic stability is essential to the health of the Welsh economy. I will quote again the document entitled, "Productivity in the UK: The Regional Dimension", which was published this week by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry. On page 29, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Macroeconomic stability is an essential precondition for creating an environment in which underperforming regions can increase their sustainable rate of growth. Macroeconomic instability has increased regional inequalities frequently in past recessions, particularly in the 1930s and the early 1980s."</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor has done Wales proud by ensuring that macroeconomic stability underpins the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Gentleman did not carry on reading his Government's report, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regional inequalities in themselves may also exacerbate overall macroeconomic volatility."</p></blockquote>
In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr, the hon. Gentleman said that regional inequalities in Wales and between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom have existed since the 1920s. Does he not feel that it is shameful that Wales has been in that position since the 1920s? We have been consistently let down by Governments. Does he not agree with my hon. Friend that we should have seen some measures in the pre-Budget report to put that situation right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several measures in the pre-Budget report are intended to move towards the elimination of regional inequalities. I agree that inequalities in the UK are too wide, but the fundamental thread running through the report is clear. Macroeconomic instability would be far more damaging to the Welsh economy than any of the regional inequalities that we have discussed. I welcome the fact that every Welsh constituency will benefit from the changes to stamp duty rates. I could list many other measures, but I can see that the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr is keen to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the single most important factor in explaining the problems of Welsh manufacturing and other export industries over the past five years the persistently overvalued pound? What action will the Chancellor of the Exchequer take on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to that. The hon. Member is keen on a devaluation policy as a way of running the economy. It does not work. It will not work in the long run either. A constant devaluation of the currency, which is what he seems to advocate, is not the answer to Wales's problems. I note with interest that he recently came within two votes of persuading his party that Wales should not be in the euro. I have the quote from 	<i>The Western Mail</i>. Moreover, he confirmed earlier that he wants Wales to have full national status within Europe, which presumably means full national status outside the United Kingdom. If Wales has full national status within Europe but is not a member of the euro when perhaps the rest of the United Kingdom has joined, what will Wales's currency be? Perhaps it will be the Wigley, and 100 ieuans will equal one wigley.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is only one Dafydd Wigley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
On the issue of the euro, I have made it clear that I support economic and monetary union, but I want stability of growth. The real point is that we need a devaluation to go into the euro. We need to go in at a competitive rate. The Chancellor could intervene in the money markets to bring it about. The Labour party did it in 1949 and in 1967. The trouble is it did it too late in 1967 and then lost the election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should update his economic text-books if he is basing everything on the economy of the 1960s and 1940s. He needs to look at the modern economy a bit more carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the tale of calamity described by Plaid Cymru does not—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, be quiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tale of calamity described by Plaid Cymru does not accord with reality. Does the hon. Member for Cardiff, West agree that the issue today is not whether Wales is about to become a third world state, but how the priorities should be balanced and, perhaps more important, the mechanisms for support? Does he agree that we should discuss the strategies rather than suggest a world picture that means that Wales is going to collapse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we should discuss the strategies. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr was trying to be sincere, but he should stop talking Wales down and engage in a serious conversation that does not paint a picture of Armageddon in the Welsh economy which is not true. There are problems in the Welsh economy. There have been job losses and factories have closed. Huge economic forces are at work. Those will mean that we will no longer be an assembly-line economy but move towards a knowledge economy. We must do that. There is pain on the way and the Government's role is to create a bridge between the old and the new economy. All that is correct and we can have an intelligent, adult discussion about it. However, we will not be helped by a parade of nit-picking lies, damned lies and statistics—I was not referring to the hon. Gentleman when I used the word "lies"—and their selective use to paint a picture of doom and gloom and to talk down the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that we discuss the economic implications of what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues propose for Wales and their true attitude to devolution. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I have been told about the pre-Budget statement today. Now I shall show why it is important to have a pre-Budget statement from a UK Chancellor and not what others would like to see. The truth is, strangely in these days, that Plaid Cymru is the most anti-devolution party of all the parties represented here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour introduced devolution and we are still committed to it. We held a referendum and set up the Assembly. The Liberal Democrats are a pro-devolution party. We may have disagreements or differences of emphasis, but we believe in the United Kingdom and devolving power down to the right level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
These days, even the Tories in Wales say that they do not want to get rid of the Assembly and are participating in its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru's project, however, is to destroy devolution, which is why its members take every opportunity to undermine it. All that stuff about Scottish powers, tax-raising powers and so on is not a political principle; it is a political tactic to undermine devolution. Plaid Cymru is aiming for full national status—so-called—within Europe. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I do not know whether that would involve its own currency. As I pointed out earlier, that means full national status outside the UK. That is the antithesis of devolution, which is intended to strengthen the UK and decision making—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman carefully and I am waiting for the point at which he relates his speech to the pre-Budget statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Thank you, Mr. Griffiths. I was getting there and now that you have made that point, I will get there much quicker than I would have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that Plaid Cymru's approach is nonsense. Wales's future and the interests of the Welsh economy lie with Wales as a devolved part of the UK, so that we can properly express our interdependence and interrelationship with the rest of the UK. The pre-Budget statement by the Chancellor
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
showed how important that is. He has bequeathed to the country the strongest economic position that we have had for decades. That is irrefutable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Petty point making, nit-picking and the use of statistics by the Opposition to undermine that central message are not what the people of Wales believe. They understand that GDP has not been falling in Wales in the past few years; it has been growing. To report relativities as absolutes is a misuse of statistics. Prosperity and the economy in Wales are strong. There are problems, which we need to face seriously and properly together, but I am sure that the Government's approach will serve the interests of the Welsh economy best of all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
