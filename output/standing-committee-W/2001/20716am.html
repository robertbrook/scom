	<div class='title'>Spending Review 2002</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered a record boost to public services in the country. The Government have been able to deliver such an historic level of public investment because it is built on a platform of stability, low inflation, low interest rates and greatly reduced unemployment. Through fiscal discipline and prudent economic management, we have put in place a more modern and long-term framework for public services, which are of great importance to all who represent Welsh constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall recap on what the spending review means for Wales. First, the Welsh block, which as recently as 1998–99 stood at just £7 billion, will have grown to nearly £12 billion by the end of the review period. That is an astonishing rate of public investment. Secondly, there will be growth in real terms in the block averaging 5.1 per cent, per annum over the period. Over and above inflation, on average we shall have 5.1 per cent, more to spend on public services in Wales each year. Thirdly, the special arrangements for objective 1 outside Barnett, which our opponents claimed could not be introduced and, indeed, doubted whether it could continue, have been maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cover in more detail what the settlement will allow the Assembly to deliver and shall touch briefly on the health increases that we announced in the spring as they form part of the current spending review. When I spoke in Committee at the time of the Budget, I announced substantial spending increases. They ran beyond the usual planning period and reflected the Government's determination to deliver world-class public health care. I shall repeat the figures now. Next year, £128 million extra will be available for health spending in Wales. The year after that, £493 million more than there is at present will be available. The following year, the extra funding increase will be £907 million, the year after that it will be £348 million and, in the fifth and final year, it will be £1,844 million. In 2007–08, £5,681 billion could be spent on health services in Wales, which is 58 per cent, more than in the current year. Undoubtedly, those increases gladden the heart of anyone who uses or cares about the health service in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now matched the health increases with new money for other services. The Welsh block will gain significantly as a result of measures being taken in England, which, for example, include significant additional spending on education. That will bring spending to 5.6 per cent, of gross domestic product by 2005–06 and will ensure that our priority of putting right our education system can be met. There is also
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
extra money for the 10-year transport plan, which will improve rail travel and tackle road congestion. There is extra money, too, for housing, particularly affordable housing, which is needed to underpin improvements in other services. Those are among the strides that we made yesterday and the reasons why the Wales block is being increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we tend to focus in our debates on the amounts that flow through my Department and the Assembly, and which make up that Wales block. However, Wales also benefits from other Government spending, both directly from what is spent in Wales by other Departments, such as the Home Office, on non-transferred functions and, more generally, on spending that is incurred for the good of the United Kingdom as a whole. Spending by other Departments on non-transferred services outside the block makes up about half of all the identifiable spending in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, Wales will also get its share of the new resources for improving law and order services. That will include investment in the police, aimed at delivering tangible reductions in robbery, vehicle crime and burglary, and new funding to tackle drug-related crime. Wales will also benefit from extra investment in information technology for the criminal justice system and the consequent streamlining of the prosecution process. Between them, those measures will make a major contribution to delivering reductions in crime throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also spending increases that will make the world a better, fairer or safer place in which to live, although that spending may not identifiably occur in Wales. Like the rest of our country, Wales needs the extra peace of mind that increased defence spending will bring. We also welcome the fairness of the additional increased overseas aid that will be available. The overarching goals of the spending review are very much goals that Wales shares. Raising productivity, extending opportunity, building strong and secure communities and securing Britain's place in the world are objectives that will benefit Wales at least as much as any other part of the United Kingdom. I know that those are goals that the Assembly will share and, so far as it is within its powers, will wish to drive forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The productivity agenda is of special interest, given the need to close the GDP per capita gap between the Wales average and that of the United Kingdom. Of course, strong and secure communities are traditionally prized in Wales, and we must continue to promote them for the benefit of all our citizens. Those are all benefits that flow from being an integral part of the United Kingdom, and they are underpinned by the long-standing stability that the Barnett formula has brought to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extra investment is made possible through our prudent management of the economy. It is economic stability and sound public finances that provide the best foundation for long-term investment in our public services. There is never any room for complacency, particularly in a time of global economic challenge, but we shall take no chances with economic stability. We shall ensure that the fiscal rules continue to be met, while taking long-term decisions to improve
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
productivity, promote work and enterprise, and invest in our public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 20 years ago, debt interest payments consumed 4 per cent, of national income; they now consume 2 per cent. That releases £20 billion a year for improved services. There are 1.5 million more women and men in work than there were five years ago. That allows the dead money of benefit payments to be recycled into new investment and enhanced services. Of course, money alone is not enough. Our approach is clear: when more is given in resources, more is required in results. We must ensure that the additional funding is spent wisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the two statements have been made, the Committee will consider proposals to ensure that the national health service in Wales has the structures in place to receive maximum benefit from the funds that Government and Parliament are giving to the National Assembly. It is a principle of this Government's approach that extra resources go hand in hand with modernisation and reform, because that is what those who rely on public services expect and deserve. We are providing the funding and reforming the structures. Those actions together will make the delivery of world-class services in Wales possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is aware that the figures that I announced are totals. The Assembly will decide how it wishes to allocate the totals among services and areas. However, one component of the block is separately identified today: the additional funding that we continue to provide to support objective 1 and the European social fund in Wales. After the past spending review two years ago, I told the Committee that we had stood by Wales and were providing £421 million for that purpose. That special arrangement has been continued in the current spending review and £492 million will be available during the three years that we are addressing. No one is more determined than I that Wales should derive maximum benefit from the unique opportunity offered by objective 1. I did my part in ensuring success by providing additional money in the past spending review. That money had never been provided before that date in the history of the Treasury. Yesterday, I continued that support by continuing to support objective 1 above and beyond Barnett for the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 570 objective 1 projects have been approved, and more than £330 million has been committed. The settlement means that the Assembly and its partners will be able to continue to take maximum advantage of the tremendous opportunities of the objective 1 programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a fine spending review for the United Kingdom and Wales. We are putting health and education right. We are giving the Assembly the resources that it needs to put Wales right. The settlement has once again demonstrated the effectiveness of a strong partnership between the Government and the Assembly to deliver results for Wales. There is record public investment that will translate into better health care, excellence in education and safer streets, and that gives confidence
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to our communities and opportunities for further generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Secretary of State for his courtesy in supplying me with a copy of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's press is full of the fact that the Chancellor has gambled his billions on the comprehensive spending review. He evidently saw England as an evens bet, but would not consider Wales each way. Despite what the Secretary of State said, we are being short changed by the process. I am interested in his response when, in England, expenditure on health will rise by 7.5 per cent., on education by 6 per cent, and across all Departments by 5.2 per cent, whereas, as usual, Wales comes in with a rise of 5.1 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State confirm that the figure of £492 million, which was mentioned on page 6 of his statement, is all European money without any Government element—I am sure that that is correct? Will he confirm that match funding for European projects must come from the Barnett block, as stated on paragraph 22.4 on page 129 of the spending review? Will he confirm that the education and health budgets of the National Assembly for Wales will have to be expended to cover match funding at the expense of the health service and schools in Wales? Will he confirm that the comprehensive spending review increase in the Welsh Barnett block is proportionally less than the comparable spending programme in England? Will he give a figure for the comparable increase in spending for England?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State agree with Professor Maclean of Nuffield college, Oxford—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say. That is staring truth in the face—obviously the sort of thing that new Labour likes to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State agree with Professor Maclean and Peter Gripaios of the university of Plymouth who say that the Barnett formula is shortchanging Wales? Year on year, Wales receives a smaller increase than England because of the Barnett squeeze. Surely it is time for the Secretary of State to stand up for Wales, do away with the Barnett formula and introduce a needs-based formula for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The percentages to which the hon. Gentleman referred are comparisons between ourselves and the United Kingdom. He knows that Wales' percentage increase this time is higher than the increase for Northern Ireland and for Scotland. He understands that because in all cases the cash addition increase per head is the same as for the rest of the United Kingdom. The reason that it is different is that the initial level of spending is higher. The amount per head is already 13 per cent, higher in Wales than in the United Kingdom. In anyone's language, that is not a bad deal for Wales in relation to the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru Members' criticisms deflect from the enormously successful story that they know that we must tell but they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that. No previous Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
increased the amount for the Welsh block to £12 billion. That is almost double what it was when the Conservative Government were in power. It is an enormous increase in the resources that the Assembly has at its disposal. They do not understand that it is not just the money that goes to the Assembly that matters, but money spent in Wales on other services, too. For example, in the financial year 2000–01, Government spending per head amounted to £4,709 in the United Kingdom, but £5,302 in Wales. The amount is even higher now as a result of the increases that I have just announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments about Europe that the hon. Gentleman used today are exactly the same as he used in this Room two years ago. Even then he could not bring himself to ask how we got objective 1 status in the first place. It did not come like manna from heaven. It came because a Labour Government obtained the grant, which Plaid Cymru Members doubted we could get. They said subsequently that we might be able to get it but that it would not extend to two thirds of Wales—and it did. The worst thing that they did was to suggest for almost a year to the people of Wales that the public spending cover of almost £500 million would never be achieved. In the lead-up to that discussion, all the spokespeople for their party—Dr. Phil Williams was one—said that what mattered was whether for the first time in the fiscal history of our country, objective 1 money would be outside the block and outside Barnett. Everyone knew that that was the argument at the time. They now believe that that should be wiped from the public memory and that it does not matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all my years in this place and as a Minister elsewhere, structural funds have had to be found from within the blocks. That £500 million—now almost £1 billion—has come to us as a consequence of that decision over and above the block that we have. There was never a great block of match funding. Some has come from the private sector: my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen) is to benefit from a private-sector objective 1 fund that the private sector will match. The First Minister and the Minister For Finance, Local Government and Communities have said time and again, as they did to me only yesterday, that not one solitary scheme will not be funded because of a lack of match funding. To suggest that hospitals and schools will not benefit because of a lack of match funding is nonsense. The entire block now goes to the Assembly to decide. It is for neither the hon. Gentleman nor me to determine where the money is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That old and stale argument about match funding was stale two years ago and is even staler today. The additional money is what mattered, and we have that. We have heard a lot of talk about the money that Wales should get, but if they had their way and they achieved an isolated, independent and separate Wales, never in a million years would they get anything like the amount of money that the Chancellor has given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his optimistic statement. It is very good for Wales, and we are all rejoicing because of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend referred to the money that has been earmarked for health, but does he agree that social services and children's services urgently need money? It is for the Welsh Assembly to make decisions about the allocation of such resources, but will he exert all of his influence to push for children's services in particular to receive a much-needed boost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, although, as I said to her two years ago, she might be better placed than me to influence such decisions. However, the Assembly rightly places great emphasis on the importance of social services and children's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties that social services face is long waiting lists caused by bed blocking. We must sharpen up on that; we must provide more resources to social services, to ensure that waiting lists go down, and that people are properly looked after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's efforts on behalf of children. She has advocated the rights of children for many years. The Assembly has the first Children's Commissioner in the UK, and in that regard it is also almost unique in Europe. The Assembly can use that post to achieve the aims that she has identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal-Democrat-led partnership government in Cardiff will welcome the real extra money for health and education. The additional resources meet the expectations that the Government's previous statements led us to have, and they should result in measurable improvements in the provision of those two key services in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us will also be very pleased with the continuing prudent commitment to pay back the national debt. Over the long term, that will make a substantial difference, not only in Wales, but in the entire UK. It shows sensible husbandry of the entire nation's macro-economic situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, many of us also feel some frustration with statements such as that which we heard yesterday, because it is always hard to see where the double-counting is taking place in them. A certain amount of scepticism has been created because, on previous occasions, what seemed to be very generous settlements have turned out to be mere re-announcements of money that has already been allocated. The Government have a slight cross to bear as a consequence of such past opportunism; on some occasions, they have sought to spin money that was already allocated, so people will have to examine this statement with a fine toothcomb to see whether there actually is some new money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long-standing Liberal Democrat commitment to reforming the way that we allocate money, not only to Wales, but to Scotland and Northern Ireland, is reinforced by the fact that extra money is being put in, above and beyond Barnett. That money is welcome, but it shows that we must look at how best to allocate money to Wales, because in the eyes of many people,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
including myself, the Barnett formula does not necessarily reflect the real basis of need in Wales and in other parts of the UK. When devolution is rolled out across the regions of the UK, it will be very important that we have a transparent and strategically need-based formula that everyone can see works effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the money for law and order is welcome, does the Minister agree that crime prevention is one of the best ways to save money in that area? We must find different ways to address crime. Would he be willing to consider the benefits of organisations such as Youth at Risk that seek to prevent offending in the first place, rather than simply enforcing law and order once we have generated a culture of crime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, does the Secretary of State accept that some of those who analysed the Chancellor's statement yesterday believe that there is centralisation in the plans he outlined because, increasingly, the Treasury is seeking to create more direct lines of financial communication, bypassing, for example, local authorities? Can he assure me that he will resist any centralisation of powers from the Assembly, which is still in its infancy and would not take kindly to or benefit from economic centralisation, whatever the motive might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point about centralisation. What matters is delivery of good public services, which must be done in partnership with local authorities and between central government and the Assembly. We must find a system to deliver the best services for the people whom we jointly represent. In the health service, that means patients, in schools, it means pupils and when crime is involved, it means victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point about double accounting, the hon. Gentleman will have heard the "Today" programme this morning when Andrew Marr, who must be a good judge of such matters, said that there is no double accounting. In my statement today, I made it clear that that was so with regard to the health figures that were announced in the Budget. We all remember the hon. Gentleman's penny—the endless penny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's general welcome for the statement. An enormous amount of money is going into public services in Wales and it is up to the Assembly to spend it wisely. I am sure that it will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, thank the Secretary of State for his courtesy in sending an advance copy of his speech to me. Page 5 states that extra investment is made possible through prudent management of the economy and that economic stability and sound public finances provide the best foundation for long-term investment in public services. That statement was made the day after £220 billion was wiped off the stock market. It has fallen to below 1996 levels, but no mention was made of that. Anyone can act like Viv Nicholson, the pools winner who said, "Spend, spend, spend", but that is not sustainable. Does the Secretary of State believe that the Chancellor's programme is sustainable when one of his advisers to the Department of Trade and Industry said that there is a £20 billion black hole at the heart of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Government spending? We already know that national insurance contributions will increase next year. That will hit everyone: employees and employers, as well as public services. Millions of pounds of the sums announced yesterday will be clawed back from local authorities, who will have to find extra cash for the increased national insurance contributions for their employees. The same applies to the health service and education. The Government are giving with one hand and clawing back with the other. We have had 53 tax increases since 1997, but no mention is made of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that public services matter. The Government will be judged on that, not the Chancellor standing at the Dispatch Box, talking of billions of pound here and billions of pounds there. What matters is how the money is spent. In Cardiff, £8 million has been spent on the hole next to the Welsh Assembly where the new building will be. Is that good value for money? Clearly, it is not. That money could have been better spent on almost anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now five years since a Labour Government was elected and we were told that things could only get better, but in Wales there is a teacher crisis, waiting lists are rising, street crime is soaring and robbery, car crime and drug crime are increasing. The south Wales police authority area alone has seen a 29 per cent, rise to 595 incidents; in Dyfed-Powys the increase is 13 per cent, and in north Wales it is 19 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gwent is the only area that has shown an improvement—it is typical that, of the four police authority areas, the Labour party is only interested in the one that has shown improvement. It is not interested in the other three areas, which cover the vast majority of people. Does the Secretary of State believe that the extra money announced yesterday will make a difference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the difference compared with the past five years, during which extra money has been spent but there has been a deterioration in public services? Let us consider the care homes that are closing throughout Wales. That is an absolute scandal, but no mention of it was made yesterday. Let us be specific. Can the Secretary of State now say that, due to yesterday's announcement, not a single care home will close and that the further investment in the care that the elderly so clearly deserve will be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am old enough to remember both Labour and Conservative Governments of the past who, instead of being able to announce huge increases in public spending, had to go to the International Monetary Fund and cut public spending. When the hon. Gentleman's party was in power for all those years, we had to endure fewer doctors, nurses and teachers, mass unemployment in Wales, interest rates at a record high and mortgage rates that went through the roof. That is what people remember after 18 years of the Government that the hon. Gentleman supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree with the general thrust of the hon. Gentleman's main point that resources must be matched by reform and delivery. However, I do not understand why his party cannot commit itself to such resources. All that it said yesterday was that it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
commit itself to defence and overseas aid. It would not say a word about spending increases for education, health and all the other things. His party is going around the world like a Cook's tour, trying to find the policies that it wants to introduce in this country. It has not a clue how it would pay for those policies. Today's statement shows that the Government have played their part in giving the proper resources to the National Assembly to ensure that it delivers those services. We have played our part in that bargain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Lucas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware of the very warm welcome that the statement has received from business in Wales? Mr. Russell Lawson, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The dramatic rise in the level of funding for schools and universities is very good news."</p></blockquote>
Does my right hon. Friend agree that investment in education and the creation of a skilled work force are the means by which Wales can develop and improve in the future? Such an approach from the Assembly would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. He knows, of course, that around the corner from his constituency—metaphorically speaking—is Ireland. If he were to look there, he would know that the economy in the Republic of Ireland, and to a certain extent in Northern Ireland, improved so dramatically during the past 20 years because resources were put into training, reskilling and education, specifically to bring up to date the skills of the young Irish generation so that they could apply those to inward investment and indigenous industry. That worked remarkably well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the hopes of the objective 1 programme, and why it is fully additional to our block, is that we will be able to use it to train young people in the skills needed in the new technological age. I think that the Assembly has grasped the nettle; it is very conscious of the fact that we need a newly trained, reskilled Wales. That is the only hope for the future, and my hon. Friend was right to draw attention to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the fact that the brilliant stewardship of the United Kingdom economy has allowed my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make money available to invest in public services in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State agree that it is important that the money go quickly to the frontline services? Given that the Welsh Assembly has decided that there will be no ring fencing for local government services and that local government elections will be held a year after the Welsh Assembly elections, how will it ensure that local government overcomes the temptation to build up reserves in this financial year to be spent liberally in its election year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Governments never do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my hon. Friend's point. He has wide experience as a Minister in the Wales Office and
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
knows the problems of achieving the effective delivery of services. There must be a good working relationship between Welsh local government and the National Assembly and, for that matter, between it and the Government and Members of Parliament. The draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill is about ensuring that the devolution of decision making comes more and more to the front line of a locality. I will ensure that my right hon. Friend the First Minister is made of aware of my hon. Friend's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says that there is no case for complacency. However, is not he being complacent in dismissing as irrelevant the fact that, for the third comprehensive spending review in a row, Wales will receive a lower increase in health and education spending than England? He cited figures for the increases in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Can he give a comparable figure for England on which the Welsh allocation was based? If the entire Barnett consequential was allocated to education, what would the average annual real-terms increase be for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the increase per head is no different in England and Wales. He and his party say continually that the Barnett formula should be changed but it gives Wales 13 per cent, more spending per head than England. That is a simple fact. The reason why that might decrease is that we are getting wealthier.
Why does the hon. Gentleman think that the situation in Scotland is different from that in Wales? It is because the Scottish economy has improved at a faster rate than the Welsh economy. The Barnett formula was established to ensure that the differences between the rest of the United Kingdom and Wales were gradually lessened. The more that the Welsh economy improves, the more that happens. I do not suggest that, for example, next Tuesday we will see such a sudden improvement in the Welsh economy that we will no longer need Barnett. However, the hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that thousands more people are in work this year than last year. He knows that Wales is growing at a faster rate than other regions of the United Kingdom. Opposition Members will still not acknowledge that £12 billion of public spending is good for Wales. I should be more than happy to engage in discussion on the detail, and I will do so with the hon. Gentleman in future. He should not be so embittered against the Labour party that he believes that anything the Government do for Wales, including the best ever settlement, is not good for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made a statement of the greatest importance and promise for Wales, for which I thank him. Brainpower and skills are the most crucial assets to the Welsh economy and the Government have afforded the Assembly a magnificent opportunity to invest in education and get money speedily to schools, colleges and universities. However, has he noted that even under the reformed stability and growth pact, which is being discussed, the European Commission would insist that eurozone member states' spending on capital as well as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
current programmes must be in balance during the cycle? That would mean deep cuts in the spending plans announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, and that spending programmes would have to be submitted to Brussels before being submitted to Assemblies. Has my right hon. Friend assessed the damage that would be caused to public services in Wales if we were to join the euro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting argument, and my right hon. Friend and I will be dealing with it in the weeks and months ahead. I understand the views of my right hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Alan Howarth), but whatever the rights and wrongs of infrastructure and capital spending in our structural funds, a balance must be struck between them because we cannot regenerate parts of our country, for example, unless there is infrastructure. I agree that reskilling and retraining should be high on the agenda, but I will not debate the issue with him further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully endorse and support the comprehensive spending review, which is excellent news for Wales. I am particularly pleased by the extra £400 million for agriculture, which brings the total to £2.9 billion. I am very pleased with the extra £70 million that was given to Wales by the National Assembly last year to support steel communities. I am also pleased that an announcement will be made today on supporting the coal areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the extra money that is going to Wales and that which has been announced for the UK, will my right hon. Friend work with Cabinet Ministers, the First Minister and the Deputy Minister for Economic Development in Wales to ensure that seaside towns such as Rhyl, Colwyn Bay—the second and third biggest towns in Wales—Prestatyn, Porthcawl, Barry and Pensarn are given parity with rural communities, steel communities, coal communities and inner-city communities? Will he ensure that we get the investment that we need after 25 years of decline?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon. Friend mentioned Porthcawl, which is one such town. Obviously, I agree with him, and he knows that in the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced changes to the ways in which we deliver benefits and deal with the new deal and unemployment. Those measures are not restricted to one particular part of Wales; coastal towns in Wales such as those in his constituency will benefit in the same way as other parts of Wales. I will ensure that his points about devolved areas are made to the First Minister and other appropriate Ministers because we would be wrong to think for one second that the difficulties and problems in Wales are confined to one particular place. In Rhyl, for example, we need to tackle severe unemployment and crime problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State's mention of the Liberal Democrats' policy of a 1p increase in tax for education reminds me of the 2p change for which the Labour Government were responsible—they took 1p off income tax just before the election and put 1p on national insurance just after it. As the Secretary of State has said on many occasions, timing is everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Turning to a more constructive issue, the Chancellor said in his statement yesterday that resources do not come without reform, with which almost all parties would agree. I should like to discuss a financial reform that would benefit the efficient delivery of education in Wales, and the Secretary of State, who is responsible for liaison between the Government and the Assembly, could play a part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of schools have complained that money that eventually ends up in their budgets takes a long time to arrive because it depends on announcements from the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. The money is delivered in dribs and drabs in order to obtain political kudos from its announcement. Schools find it difficult to plan their budgets unless they know their totality. In my constituency, for instance, staff have been threatened with redundancy because the budget will not accommodate them. The money arrives in the end, but the loss of morale as a result of the process could be avoided. Will the Secretary of State take the initiative to ensure that schools get their total budgets at an early stage in order to allow them to conduct the necessary long-term planning for effective education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point and I shall ensure that it is relayed to the appropriate Ministers in the National Assembly. It is fair to point out that there is a different system once there is devolution. In the old days, my predecessors were presumably able to process such matters within weeks or even days. Things are different now because the National Assembly's budget regime is transparent and must take into account a Committee structure. That is part of the devolution project for which people voted.

There has been an enormously generous settlement for education, not just in this but in the previous spending review. If one considers the two spending reviews together, the amount of money that is

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing for the second or third time running a Barnett-busting increase in spending for Wales. Does he agree that the position taken earlier by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) on the so-called Maclean report from Nuffield college represents little more than bogus opportunism? Perhaps I am wrong about that. If I am, would my right hon. Friend consider accepting a delegation from the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to meet anyone, any time, anywhere. Of course, the matter is hugely complex. It would be an oversimplification to suggest that out of the blue there would suddenly come a huge amount of extra money for Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula. Most of the questions that I am asked about the Barnett formula are not from Welsh or Scottish Members of Parliament, but from English MPs who have envied the special treatment that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have received, quite rightly, in the years since Barnett was introduced. The reality is that all the talk of Barnett, match funding and all the rest of it would be utterly meaningless if we were to be swept away into the Atlantic as an independent state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State recognise that this is not Barnett plus but Barnett plus, plus? Looking for reform of the Barnett formula is like looking for fool's gold because the real gold is lying at our feet, and the Government, having laid the foundations of the Assembly, still have a vested interest in how it is spent. Hon. Members have alluded to many concerns this morning about how money is passed to front-line services. However, in passing on those concerns—as I shall, too—does my right hon. Friend recognise that, ultimately, this is a devolution settlement and that, although we still have an interest in how the structure is built, we must let the Assembly get on with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. That is part of the settlement, which is about ensuring that the National Assembly is responsible for the functions that are devolved to it. We have a responsibility for the legislation as well as for the resources. Today, we will be considering such legislation, which means that the health service in Wales will be delivered more locally and more accountably. That is for us to decide in partnership with the Assembly through the legislation that we pass. Of course, we all have an interest because all of us represent the same people in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend about the Barnett plus, plus. It is a very special deal that we have now had for three years, and we will have it for a future three years. As well as the money going into that objective 1 structural funding, we now have the schemes. They are
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
beginning to work in each of the constituencies of those who represent objective 1 areas. Overall, that is a hugely important scheme for Wales, which never happened in the past but has under a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, should we not also look at the unfortunate losses in manufacturing industry, which has seen the darkest events in Wales during recent years? Those losses have not just been of jobs, but of capacity. Blast furnaces and aluminium factories are closing down, never to be re-opened. That is a very severe blow. Before we engage in a self-indulgent, speculative look at the scare stories on what might happen when we enter the eurozone, we should reflect on the evidence given by Corus, Alcan and Allied Steel and Wire, which have said that being outside the eurozone is the principal reason why jobs have been lost in Wales. Being outside the eurozone means that Welsh production is artificially dear, and that that in Europe is artificially cheap. That has been a major cost to the Welsh economy. When we look to our decision, we might well use the following accurate slogan when talking to the people of Wales: "It is either euro or your job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Newport, East (Alan Howarth), and with other industries in our constituencies. I believe that many firms have had difficulties because they were not in the eurozone. That is not the full picture of course; there are other reasons, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I would make to my hon. Friends is that we are providing other forms of employment for people as the Welsh economy is changing. That is why there are more people in work this year than there were last year, despite the problems that we have had in manufacturing industry. I read in 	<i>The Western Mail</i> yesterday—I did not like what I read today because it was more interested in the Cabinet's mode of transport than what we discussed—that inward investment is now higher in Wales than in any other part of the United Kingdom. That is a significant factor, which highlights the fact that Wales is still going places despite the problems of the past, and each of us wants to ensure that we encourage industry. That does not mean that people who have been affected by redundancies in my hon. Friend's constituency and mine feel any less happy about that, but there are jobs to go to, which would not have been the case years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hywel Francis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the comprehensive spending review, particularly with regard to spending on education.

energy park, by an old Welsh saying with which I am sure that the Secretary of State is familiar: "gorau arf, arf dysg"—the best weapon is the weapon of learning. With that in mind, I am sure that my right hon. Friend would agree with Sir Edward George and with the Chancellor, who summed that up in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 18 June by saying that education is the best anti-poverty and social and economic development strategy. Does the Secretary of State agree with that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree with that. My hon. Friend spent a lifetime ensuring that people in adult education could go on to better jobs and better futures. He knows what a difference education makes to people.

	<div class='title'>Coal State Aid</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to make a brief statement regarding coal state aid in the United Kingdom and Wales, and this seems the appropriate time to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced a targeted extension of the United Kingdom's current coal state aid scheme from 23 July until the end of the year. That is good news for Wales and the coal industry. My right hon. Friend has agreed to seek the European Commission's agreement to a modified extension of the subsidy scheme in order to help secure the long-term future of viable mines under exceptional short-term pressure. She will be consulted shortly on the details of additional criteria that are to be used in making awards of aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to make this announcement to the Committee. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales and I have been putting forward Wales' case in past months, as indeed have several hon. Members in this Committee who have constituencies in coal-mining areas. The announcement will be particularly welcomed by coal-operating companies in Wales, including Betws colliery, which the Under-Secretary visited on 17 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to announcing the targeted extension of the operating aid scheme, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry also announced that she would consult on an investment aid scheme for pits that have a viable future that would use the flexibility secured at European level to pay for such aid. To date, European rules have prevented us from supporting viable investment projects through regional selective assistance. That announcement, too, is excellent news for Wales, and I am sure that it comes as a direct result of the many interventions that have been made by hon. Members here, Members of European Parliament, and the Assembly itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted at the news. Betws colliery paid for my
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
university education, and as a result of this statement, more than 100 families in my constituency will continue to have employment. The investment aid will create the potential to expand that to between 250 and 300 jobs in the near future. I am glad that, on this occasion, the Government have listened and understood the logic of the case that Plaid Cymru and others have been putting since the beginning of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise with the Secretary of State the urgent issue of the availability of employer liability insurance in the mining sector. That matter has already resulted in the closure of one mine in the north of England and is a problem for Betws colliery, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point and shall certainly relate it to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's other points, he has, quite rightly, made representations on behalf of his constituents in Betws, as indeed have other hon. Members in Committee and in the Assembly. The joint effort made by all of us has obviously paid off. It is important, not just symbolically but in real terms, that there are hundreds of people who still work in the coal industry in Betws, Tower—in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)—and elsewhere. The announcement is bound to be good news for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This news will be welcome throughout coal-mining areas, and particularly those that still exist in Wales. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales came to the launch of a book on Tower called "Tower of Strength" last week. We were pleased to see him there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tower is a viable pit. It has made a profit year in, year out, since the miners became its owners. Everyone pays tribute to its success. This scheme, which will be very much welcomed, shows the Government's commitment to continuing to support a source of energy that is indigenous to our country. Unlike the previous Government, whose main aim seemed to be to close every pit in sight, this Government are continuing to invest in those pits that have a viable future, such as that in my constituency which has a work force of 400, and might have even more if the scheme is extended. I remember going to Europe with people from Tower colliery some years ago. The Energy Minister there said that he would like to support us, but that the rules prevented him from doing so. I hope that we shall see some developments when the talks continue with the Department of Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As well as going down the pit for 24 hours, she has played a uniquely important role to ensure that Tower colliery remained a viable proposition. In fact, it has gone from being viable to a highly successful company in its own right. She was right to remind the Committee that Tyrone O'sullivan came to the House of Commons last week to launch his book. It is a shame that he will not be in the Welsh Assembly, but he wants to ensure that Tower colliery goes from strength to strength. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
investment aid scheme may be of use to the colliery, but my hon. Friend was also right to point out that the Government believe that there is a future for mining in Wales, which is why one scheme has been extended and another has been introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, congratulate the Government on their success in obtaining the funding that will ensure the continuation of the coal industry in Wales and give it confidence over the years to come. It is particularly significant that that accomplishment has been gained through partnership and working together for the benefit of the people we represent, rather than through pulling things apart. Tower colliery is important to my constituents. At one time, the surrounding communities of Hirwaun and Penderyn were part of the Brecon and Radnor constituency and we still maintain links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) referred to the difficulty that certain operations in Wales have in obtaining employer liability insurance. I do not mean only small pits and drift mines, but quarries. During the past few weeks, quarries in my constituency have had to make people redundant. They are in a state of suspended animation, wondering whether they can renew their employer liability insurance. Anything that the Government can do to assist them will be gratefully accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point was made by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr and I shall certainly pass it on to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). We all agree that it is appropriate for a Welsh Grand Committee still to be discussing the future of the coal industry in Wales, despite the problems that we have experienced in the past. It is important to our constituencies. We must remember our heritage and the fact that we owe a great debt to the miners of south and north Wales for what they have done over the years. If we can go some way to ensure that we repay that debt, all the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his statement. He said that there have been problems in the mining industry, not only in Wales, but throughout the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) referred to mine closures under the Conservative Administration. That has continued under the current Administration and we have heard sad news today about the closure of the Selby complex with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the European Coal and Steel Community treaty will end after a 50-year run, the statement on coal state aid is timely. It will give security to the industry. I do not suppose that the Secretary of State has the answer at his fingertips, but the announcement from Europe affects not only this country, but several other coal-producing areas of the European Union. I should be interested to know how Wales and, indeed, the whole of the United Kingdom,
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
compares with other countries, especially Germany, to see if we are receiving a good deal. Because of the flexibility that will come about as a result of the ending of the ECSC treaty, can the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what action he has taken on steel, especially in light of the announcement about Allied Steel and Wire Ltd. in Cardiff going into administration? If the same pressure could be brought to bear on the steel industry—it is the same treaty—surely we could get short-term support for that industry as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On steel, the big issue that has exercised the minds of Governments is the United States' tariffs. It was important for the European Union as a whole to deal with that because it has a serious impact on steel, although it did not particularly affect ASW. I take the hon. Gentleman's general points, and I shall write to him about what other European countries are doing with regard to the European Coal and Steel Community treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have negotiated the flexibility to which the hon. Gentleman referred to pay investment aid at up to 30 per cent, of the cost of viable investment projects in the new European coal state aid regime, which he rightly said replaces the current regime that expires next week. That is why there was urgency. The operating aid scheme extends to the end of the year, but the investment aid scheme is new and will be introduced in the new calendar year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the main debate. I remind hon. Members that we have from now until 1 pm, and that the debate can continue from 4 pm until 6 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>[Relevant document: The Third Report from the Welsh Affairs Committee, Session 2001–02, on the draft NHS (Wales) Bill, HC 959.]</i></p>
	<p>11.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill.</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee for much longer with my voice—it is disappearing among other things—but I will remind hon. Members what the Bill says. It will provide powers for the National Assembly for Wales to create regulations to implement three elements of policy for the national health service in Wales. First, the Bill will allow a reform of community health councils in Wales, which will retain and strengthen them with extended powers and responsibilities. Secondly, the Bill will establish the Wales Centre for Health, which will provide a forum for multidisciplinary advice on health hazards and risk assessments of threats to health, and will disseminate research and other evidence to support decision making and multi-professional training. Thirdly, the Bill will establish Health Professions Wales, which will be a body to provide quality assurance for training and education of health-care professions in Wales and will continue other work
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
formerly done by the Welsh National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is short, with 10 clauses and four schedules. It was given advance drafting authority in the Queen's Speech on 20 June 2001 to allow for early publication. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will listen carefully to what hon. Members say, and he will wind up for the Government as far as he can because, of course, this is a unique opportunity, and my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), who is Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, will contribute to the debate. This is the first time that a draft Wales—only Bill has been given pre-legislative scrutiny in such a way. It is unique because both we and the Assembly are scrutinising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said that we shall see how things go and decide whether the experiment—or pilot scheme—has been successful. If it has not, we shall have to try other methods. It strikes me that the scheme has been successful and that the Welsh Affairs Committee has come up with interesting ideas, suggestions and proposals on the Bill's measures. At the same time, the Health and Social Services Committee in the National Assembly for Wales is meeting and will report tomorrow to the Assembly in Tenby. The Minister for Health and Social Services, Jane Hutt, will write to me to set out the Assembly's conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been discussed in another place with the Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and the Under-Secretary. I shall meet an all-party delegation from the House of Lords tonight to discuss this and other measures and to find out whether the scrutiny has progressed in the way that the Lords would like. Additionally, the Welsh Affairs Committee has taken evidence, worked well with our colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales and reached conclusions, which my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South will outline if he catches your eye, Mr. Griffiths.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State draws conclusions about whether this mechanism of dealing with draft legislation is a success, will he also consider the way in which future Welsh Affairs Committees will be drawn up, and in particular how they will be drawn up if—God forbid— there were to be another Tory Government in Westminster? As I have said, a bad precedent is being set, because the Welsh Affairs Committee does not have to be—and often has not been—mainly made up of hon. Members who come from Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must consider that point of view. However, the fact that we are meeting now, as the Welsh Grand Committee, to conclude this pre-legislative scrutiny in Parliament means that every hon. Member who represents a Welsh constituency has an opportunity to express their point of view, as do other hon. Members who have an interest in Welsh matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that that is the end of the story. We must look at this issue and develop it. The Welsh Affairs Committee is charged with looking after matters such as this, and the Welsh Grand Committee can then discuss them. At the end of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
day, the proposals for addressing them of the Assembly, the Welsh Grand Committee and the Welsh Affairs Committee will come to me, and I and my Government colleagues will decide how best to deal with them in the context of the full Bill, which will be published after we have given consideration to those points of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the opinion of the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) that this would be a good forum in which to draw together all the strings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a constituency-based point to the Secretary of State. On the issue of whether community health councils should be coterminous, I ask that that should not always be written in stone. The northern and southern halves of my constituency look in different directions, and the same is true of various areas of Powys. It would be inappropriate for there to be one community health council that covers the whole of Gwynedd. I may also be speaking for other parts of Wales. I ask the Secretary of State to introduce some flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that other hon. Members may wish to make similar points to that. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has made a note of what the hon. Gentleman has said, and he will refer to it in his winding-up speech. However, the Under-Secretary will not give the Government's response to the Welsh Affairs Committee, or to the matters that have been raised by hon. Members here today. He will refer to what they have said, but the formal Government response will come later in the year, before the Bill is formally published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Bills give Parliament and the Assembly an opportunity to look at Bills before they are finalised. That is the way of the future, with regard to how we work in partnership with the Assembly, and how we make laws for our people in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the debate. I know that hon. Members have a keen interest in these matters, and that the Under-Secretary will respond—as far as he can—to the points that they make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be called to speak on this historic day for Parliament, and for democratic accountability in Wales. It is a historic day for two reasons. First, it is the day on which the Prime Minister is being questioned by the Liaison Committee, of which I am a member. For the benefit of the Welsh Grand Committee, I have just been informed that the Prime Minister told the Liaison Committee that draft legislation is a very good idea because it improves the quality of legislation, and that the idea is to extend it in the future. It is also a historic day because this Welsh Grand Committee has gathered to discuss the first ever draft Bill in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will note that I have elected to ignore the media circus that will concentrate on the business of the Liaison Committee, and that I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
will instead address the important bread-and-butter issues of health in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fulfilling the responsibility that was placed on the Committee by the Secretary of State, I can today inform him and other Members that the Welsh Affairs Committee wrote to 60 professional groups in England and Wales to request their opinion on this draft Bill. In addition, more than 200 press notices were distributed to various groups and bodies in England and Wales, requesting their views. In the Committee's evidence sessions, we played host to witnesses from the Assembly, including its Minister for Health and Social Services, Jane Hutt, and the Chair of its Health and Social Services Committee, Kirsty Williams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Welsh Affairs Committee attended a sitting of that Committee, which was an interesting experience. It led me to believe that the format of future draft Bills should be something between a Green Paper and a Bill, with explanatory notes included at each relevant point. That is a personal view, not the view of the Committee. It was exposed by the fact that that Committee seemed to treat the Bill line by line rather than considering how each line might be changed. That was recognised following discussion. I thank those involved for their cooperation, for having attended our proceedings in Cardiff, for playing their part in the pre-legislative process and for having entered into the co-operative spirit that underlies the draft Bill process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the draft Bill was published in May, it was not a good day for health in Wales—I am sorry, it was not just a good day for health in Wales—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I thought that I would cheer up the Opposition, who have not had a good day so far. It was also a good day for direct democracy and parliamentary accountability in Wales, and I am proud of the Government's commitment in creating such a groundbreaking precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Bill is an important step in the revitalisation of the national health service. It cannot be viewed in isolation from the massive increase in investment injected into the NHS in Wales in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Bill is an intrinsic part of the Government's strategy for the reform of the health service in Wales. It is designed to ensure that the patient's voice is central to the creation of improved services across the board. In undertaking its pre-legislative responsibility, the Committee recognised and tried to build in that important factor. I am cognisant of the fact that many hon. Members want to speak, but I should like to summarise the main recommendations of the Select Committee report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on the principle of draft legislation for Wales, the Committee warmly welcomed the publication of the first ever draft Bill for Wales. We hope that it becomes common practice for not only stand-alone Wales-only Bills but clauses in Bills for England and Wales that have particular implications for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Secondly, we welcome the Assembly's commitment to provide for public consultation, before the Bill is enacted, on the regulations to be made under the Bill. That will greatly facilitate the passage of the Bill through the House. The problem would not have been foreseen without the pre-legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role and future of community health councils form a major part of the draft Bill. The Committee's examinations of the proposals on CHCs is based on a desire to ensure that no opportunity is missed in ensuring that the new-look CHCs in Wales fulfil their potential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend join me in welcoming the widening of the remit for community health councils into primary care? Does he believe that NHS dentistry is an aspect of primary care in Wales that needs investigation? Does he believe that the issue of dentists attracted by state grants to set up in Wales but who no longer perform NHS dental work for their patients should be urgently looked into?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee did look into that, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware. I agree entirely. I welcome the change in CHCs' remit, as did the Committee. We see no reason to constrain the freedom to be given to the Assembly to lay down the principles underlying the appointment of CHC members. Among our recommendations is that the Bill be amended to give CHC members the statutory right to time off work for public duties, which at present they do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We further recommend that the Assembly be given powers to extend by regulation the scope of CHCs' powers to inspect premises used to provide publicly funded health care for the public in their district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about giving time off, I assume that that would mean that the Welsh Assembly would pay the employer. Without going into any other aspects of that, has the hon. Gentleman made an estimate of how much it would cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not made such an estimate and nor did the Committee, but the evidence that we saw from the bodies concerned strongly recommended the practice. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the normal procedure that allows people to take part in such bodies is that they have free time off and are then paid by the body to replace any loss of earnings. That is the norm. Under existing legislation for such things as county council duties, I do not think that there is any provision for the payment of companies. That is part of their public duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other recommendations include changes in the right to information and for CHCs not to be constrained to the Welsh borders when acting on behalf of Welsh patients receiving treatment outside Wales. The Committee also addressed the independence of CHCs in any arrangements made for the employment of their staff, which is highlighted in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Wales Centre for Health, the Committee recommends a review of the terms in the draft Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
under which that centre is obliged to comply with any direction from the National Assembly for Wales, with a view to limiting that obligation to the exercise of its administrative and financial functions. In other words, we do not want to impose too much on its independence. On balance, the Committee was satisfied that the basic statutory function of dealing with the protection and improvement of health in Wales is broad enough to allow the Assembly and the Wales Centre for Health itself to develop the centre's work as appropriate. The Committee is confident that the Assembly well understands the desire to see the centre as a genuinely accessible public resource for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has made 22 recommendations in all, but I shall not go through each today. Hon. Members may rest assured that the Welsh Affairs Committee fulfilled the obligation placed on it by the Secretary of State, and has suggested many improvements to the draft Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I cannot let Opposition Members off the hook entirely today following the appalling contributions made yesterday in the debate on the comprehensive spending review and the commentary that has followed its publication. To hear Members of all Opposition parties accuse the Government of so-called control freakery is a joke when one considers the trust placed in Members of this House to scrutinise the draft Bill. The Government may have a large majority in this House but, unlike their predecessors in the Conservative party, they are demonstrating an unprecedented commitment to parliamentary accountability and a determination to listen and consult. The draft Bill, the very concept of pre-legislative scrutiny and the voluntary appearance of the Prime Minister at the Liaison Committee twice a year expose the hollowness of yesterday's Opposition rhetoric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer a point made in an earlier intervention on the Secretary of State, it seems to me that it is appropriate for the legislation to be examined by the Select Committee and then dealt with collectively by the Grand Committee. The arrangement that my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central suggested would not be appropriate under a Tory Government that operated in the way that the previous one did, because there would be no draft legislation to consider anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the devolution settlement, requests for legislation are bound to come from the Assembly. The present arrangements enable the Government to turn down those requests flatly, so it could be that no draft legislation would come about, or that a mechanism would have to be found for that to happen. I have suggested in the past that there should be an automatic requirement for a Committee such as this to consider any proposals that come from the Assembly, to avoid the problem that my hon. Friend just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slightly different point, although a related one, and I agree with it. My point was that we would not have the opportunity to look at draft legislation without at the very least enshrining it in Standing Orders. These are early days and this is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
exciting time for the way in which we deal with legislation. I agree that my hon. Friend's points need to be considered. In conclusion, by any measure this is an historic day for Parliament, and I hope that before the end of the debate all Members will have acknowledged and welcomed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming the first draft Bill for Wales and the opportunity for Welsh Members to scrutinise it; I hope that all Welsh Bills will follow that procedure in future. In answering the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central, the Secretary of State said that this was not the end of the story, and perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us whether this is a process or an event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the Secretary of State's press release of 17 May holds off until paragraph 3 before making the points that the Bill demonstrates the benefits of the close working relationship between the United Kingdom Government and the Assembly and that it is a further example of the success of devolution. Irrespective of the Bill's status, I welcome it—as far as it goes—as proof or otherwise of the success of devolution. My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) hopes to discuss some of its detail later in the day if he is fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Griffiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by paying my respects and tributes to the people who work in the NHS in Wales. Before entering the House, I worked closely with NHS staff both in hospitals and out in the community as a social worker for 10 years and as a teacher and trainer for 15 years. During that period I saw heroic attempts to overcome the poor conditions and lack of resources that bedevilled the health service. I worked in huge Victorian mental hospitals in which people were shut up for decades, where I grant that they were cared for with kindness but in conditions that I would not want either for my relatives or for myself, which must be the ultimate test. There are some who speak with less authority because they have opted out of the state system, but be that as it may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also worked with people who had left the hospital system and whose only support systems were visits by hard-pressed GPs, nurses or social workers and drug treatments that often had horrible side effects. I played my part in admitting people to hospitals, the names of which evoked terror in those unacquainted with the asylum that they provided, against their will. I saw the effects of the changes in the organisation of health care such as foolish and futile attempts to impose a market structure on a public service, and I heard Members of the Conservative Government at that time claiming that their reforms would provide choice—the choice was merely to dine at the Ritz if one had the wherewithal. I saw the chaos and the criminal waste of scarce resources that those alleged reforms engendered. I am therefore saddened and angered that, despite the commitment and hard work of NHS staff over the past five years, in many ways the service has worsened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting lists have grown, and we might as well get that over with now because the figures speak for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
themselves. In 1997, 28,401 people waited as out-patients for more than three months compared with 85,546 in 2001. In 1997, 5,956 people waited as out-patients for more than six months compared with 45,756 in 2001, which is an increase of 668 per cent. In 1997, 6,274 people were waiting as in-patients compared with 9,037 in 2001. In 1997, 1,402 people were waiting as in-patients for 18 months compared with 4,045 in 2001. In case one thinks that that is the end of the story, the figures for 2002 confirm that trend. The provisional figures for this year state that the number of people waiting for a first out-patient appointment is 73,362, which is an increase of 2.8 per cent.; the number of people waiting for 12 months to be admitted as in-patients or day cases is 10,497, which is an increase of 1.4 per cent.; the number of those waiting more than 18 months is 4,201, which is an increase of 0.8 per cent. I thank the Committee for bearing with me while I went through those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Secretary of State defend those figures? Will he guarantee that waiting lists will fall as a result of the spending review announced yesterday? Will health be put right, as he said it would earlier? I would be happy to give way to hear such a guarantee from the Secretary of State; perhaps his hon. Friends will reply later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 800 nurse vacancies in Wales because the establishment has grown. However, that is of no comfort to those waiting for an appointment, let alone for treatment. I understand that there are also 130 GP vacancies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spending on health has increased substantially, and it would be ridiculous and churlish not to welcome and acknowledge that. Hon. Members will recall that during the last meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee the Secretary of State was pressed to state the percentage spending increase on the health service in Wales compared with the percentage spending increase in England. The Secretary of State's answer eventually acknowledged that health spending would rise by 6.8 per cent, in Wales, whereas it would be 7.4 per cent, in England, although this morning he said that the figure was 7.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is no doubt enthralling the Committee with his many statistics. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] If hon. Members will bear with me, I shall get to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Griffiths. My point is that, so far, the hon. Gentleman has complained that not enough money has been spent. He has acknowledged that very large sums of money have been spent, but he has not suggested what he or his party would do to create better delivery apart from simply spending even more money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should contain himself and bate his breath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we spend more in Wales than in England. We spend more because we need to. Health is worse in Wales than in England; the need is greater, so we
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
spend more. The alternative is to spend the same in Wales as in England, even though the need is different. To defend the fact that spending in Wales is rising at a lower rate than in England because of need is equally ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will bear with me, as I am in need of care today because I am not feeling too well. To reflect on the point raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central, does my hon. Friend accept that the important point is not just money, but delivery? The national health service framework for coronary care states that Ceredigion must have a cardiologist consultant in Bronglais, but Jane Hutt of the National Assembly says that we cannot have one because the money is not available. However, that same Assembly is prepared to spend £15 million once again on restructuring the health service and introducing 52 new bodies for that service in Wales. The question is not just about money, but the manner in which services are delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point, to which I shall refer later. If I were in the position of spending all this money, I would not spend it on yet another restructuring, which is the sixth in the past 13 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out to the Committee that the debate is on the draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill? Although that gives scope to talk about health spending and so on, it must be placed within the context of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Griffiths, for that help. The Bill is, of course, an essential part of the context in which I wish briefly to compare spending in Wales with that in other countries in the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Welsh Affairs Committee referred to the difficulty in getting proper statistics. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The grave difficulties confronting public health data collection will offer an early challenge to the new Wales Centre for Health."</p></blockquote>
That is a relevant point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wales Office report reveals that identifiable spending per head on health and personal social services in Wales was £1,303 in 2001. If we compare that with the health figures released in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for the year 2000, we find that UK spending was $1,763, which was better than in Spain, Portugal and Greece, worse than in Austria, Ireland and Italy and much worse than in the Netherlands, France and Denmark. Denmark spent $2,420 that year. Thankfully, the figures for Germany for the year 2000 are not available, because in 1998 it spent £2,451 per head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the identifiable spending per head on health and personal social services in Wales in 2001 was £1,303, or $2,036. We are not comparing the same year, and the different base for counting flatters Wales. Therefore, I feel safe in drawing comparisons with health spending in other European countries. In 2001, Wales spent less than Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and the Netherlands spent in 2000, less than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Luxembourg spent in 1999 and less than Germany spent in 1995. The figures that we found for Germany do not go back further than 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said a moment ago that his aim was to have the best health service in the world. Historically, we have been a long way from that, at least in terms of spending. As the Government say, there is great scope for catch-up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that he has described a historical legacy of underspending and that it would be extremely foolish to leap in one jump to the levels of spending that he describes for other countries? It would be unsustainable to do so. That is a serious point. Does he agree that the Government's ambition to reach at least the European average level is right, but that they cannot inject all the money at once, as the NHS would not be able to sustain such a change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that spending in Wales is actually higher than the European average. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. However, I am puzzled by the Government's unwillingness to examine the historical record. A phrase in Welsh,
	<br><blockquote><p>"yr euog a flu heb neb yn eu herlid",</p></blockquote>
means "the guilty flee unpursued". It strikes me that Governments sometimes have that attitude to the historical record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman get to the point now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we welcome the extra spending that was announced but, despite its importance, it is not the only consideration for developing our health service. Therefore, we also give a broad welcome to the proposals in the Bill for the retention and reform of community health councils, which will give them more power and responsibility. I want to refer to the membership of community health councils. A considerable body of research shows that such organisations often find it very difficult to recruit members from socially excluded groups such as people on low incomes, people who belong to ethnic groups and, for that matter, Welsh speakers. Research by Rowntree on the consultation on the NHS and community care in Powys in the early 1990s shows the intense difficulties that were experienced in recruiting into the process people from those groups, specifically Welsh speakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also welcome the establishment of the Association of Welsh Community Health Councils, which will have responsibility for the performance of CHCs, and the fact that it is a national Welsh body. The Wales Centre for Health, an independent training, advisory and research body, is very welcome, as is the Health Professions Wales body to monitor the standards of training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we now face the sixth major structural reform in the past 13 years. It promises to be a bureaucratic nightmare with, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central has pointed out in the past, 52 bodies taking control: 22 local health boards, 15 health trusts, 12 or so local partnerships and three Assembly
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
regional offices. Restructuring often works best when it makes things simpler. The proposed structure is complicated and labyrinthine—quite apart from the effects of the probable implementation lag, which might be 6 or 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been pointed out, it is incumbent on Opposition parties not only to criticise, but to put forward positive alternatives. What more could have been done? The Bill could have addressed the cost of long-term personal care in Wales, as has been done in Scotland, if only because of the scale of the problem in our country. Wales has a higher proportion of elderly people—17.3 per cent, of the population in Wales is aged over 65. In England, that percentage is 15.6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way yet again. Wales could have done those things, but if it had, it would have taken money away from the rest of the health service. If the hon. Gentleman is proposing that that should have happened, would he propose from where he would take the money to fund it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, the assessment that we have had is that it would cost £40 million in the first year, which would have risen in the future, but the proportion of the gross domestic product spent would be consistent. We believe that that is a matter for the National Assembly to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is. The proportion of elderly people in Wales is higher, as I said. We accept that, since 1 April, the first six months of personal care is free, and we welcome that. Plaid Cymru is in favour of any care being free. As the royal commission states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Care in the NHS is free—the risks and costs are best pooled. Needing care when older cannot be predicted and that risk and that cost should be shared as widely as possible."</p></blockquote>
Free care is simple and cheap to administer. It is transparent and fair, unlike the Government's proposed system. For example, it eliminates the need to decide whether a bath is being given for social or medical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is, each person will need to be assessed, which will take about an hour every three months. The assessment will be carried out by NHS nurses. It is estimated that 1,800 will be immediately needed in Wales, and that is just the start. How long will it take, and how much will it cost? The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central is interested in saving money; here is a way of doing that. Can he seriously claim that that is the best possible use of resources when confronted with the fundamental causes of bad health?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are to see the establishment of the Wales Centre for Health. In May 1998, the Wales Office published the consultation document "Better Health Better Wales", concerning new approaches to tackling the underlying causes of bad health. In October 1998, a strategic framework was published reflecting responses to the consultation document and setting out aims and priorities for improving health and reducing health inequalities. A number of changes were proposed, including the setting up of local health alliances, the development of a health promotion strategy and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
establishment of a Wales Centre for Health to provide a focus on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Welsh Affairs Committee note on page 19, that was one of 15 priorities for 1999–2002. Four years after "Better Health Better Wales", we welcome the creation of the WCH. Hopefully, the centre will do much to draw attention to the underlying causes of ill health and come up with long-term strategies for tackling such causes as the health divide. The Welsh index of multiple deprivation shows clearly that bad health is linked to low income. Life expectancy of manual workers is between five and eight years shorter than that of professional people, and mortality and morbidity from heart disease is worse in poor and deprived areas. That is the broad view of health, rather than a focus on clinical interventions. Bad housing is another cause. Life expectancy for homeless people is 47 years—30 years less than for those with proper housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales continues to have a high level of unfit housing with more people living in damp, cold conditions and suffering poor health. Interestingly, the Welsh index now shows clearly that that is a rural as well as an urban problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smoking is another cause of bad health and needs to be addressed. There are 7,000 tobacco-related deaths in Wales alone each year. The BMA has voted to ban smoking in hospitals, but staff and visitors huddle outside hospital entrances to smoke, as I have seen for myself. That is bad for patients, staff and visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Welsh language, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs expressed concern that there was no provision in the draft Bill to apply the Welsh Language Act 1993 to HPW, although there is provision to apply it to CHCs. The Assembly's Minister with responsibility for health has assured us that HPW will be covered and that discussions are currently being held with the Welsh Language Board to facilitate that. It has called for that to be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have fundamental problems with Welsh language plans. The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Welsh Language Board seem to address the frills of services: letters, telephone calls, answering telephones and so on. We want an assurance—even a guarantee—that face-to-face services will be provided in patients' language of choice whenever possible. We are a long way from that. In an interesting paper to the guild of graduates of the university of Wales, Bangor on 28 June, Gwerfyl Roberts, a colleague of mine, stated that 50 years after the establishment of the NHS we still lack a basic Welsh vocabulary of standard terms associated with pain. That would be a straightforward clinical tool, but it is not available. Furthermore, the work carried out by Andrew Misel for the Welsh Consumer Council demonstrates clearly the lack of provision in Welsh, which I have also experienced in mental health practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we welcome the draft Bill and the scrutiny process, but it is modest in the face of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
enormous scale of health needs in Wales. With due regard to the fact that both the Secretary of State and the Minister represent valleys constituencies, may I say as a mere Gog that our response is not, "Yes, butty"; it is, "Yes … but".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the three or four hours for which the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) spoke, he brilliantly undermined the thesis of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central. Clearly, we have a long way to go if we want the Welsh Grand Committee to become involved in pre-legislative scrutiny. Around 90 or 95 per cent, of the hon. Gentleman's speech did not address the draft Bill. That would be the danger if a Committee such as this, which tends to divide on partisan lines, were allowed to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny. A Select Committee works as a corporate body. Much of its work is tedious and much less interesting than having a go at the Opposition, but important if we want to scrutinise law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs and enjoyed and valued our first exercise in pre-legislative scrutiny. We should have liked more time to ascertain the views of the various players on the health stage in Wales and I am sure that we can further improve the way in which we co-ordinate and work with the National Assembly when we undertake such a role in future. I think that we did a good job and I am sure that it is appropriate that the next stage of scrutinising the draft Bill should fall to the Welsh Grand Committee—I was fairly confident of that until a few moments ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Select Committee, we were restrained in choosing a task to take on. In the main, we did not become involved in the wider political debate. We deliberately avoided arguments about the merits of the approaches adopted in other parts of the United Kingdom compared with those proposed for Wales in the draft Bill. We refused to be tempted into the enticing role of improving and enhancing the draft Bill by using it as a vehicle for our favourite health service hobby horses. Even when those who submitted evidence tried to persuade us to take on their favourite health service hobby horses, we resisted. That was not because we disagreed with measures such as banning smoking in public buildings, improving healthy living promotion or getting over health data collection problems created by data protection and human rights legislation. My guess is that the overwhelming majority of Committee members would support such objectives. However, the Bill is not the means to those ends. Its scope is much more limited, as has been said. It focuses on: keeping community health councils in Wales, but providing for change, and giving them a bigger role; creating a Wales Centre for Health with the functions that have been described; and the establishment of Health Professions Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee considered how the draft Bill set about achieving those objectives, and made recommendations that we believe will help the final Bill to achieve them. The debate in Committee was about, "Is this the best way to do it?" Practically none
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
of it was about, "Should we be doing this?" or "Is this the best way forward for the NHS in Wales?" That is mainly thanks to the fact that Opposition Members who served on the Committee saw the Select Committee as a legislation-improvement mechanism for the Bill rather than a party political forum. I think that they were right to adopt that approach, and I pay tribute to them for it. I am sorry that the two Conservative Members who served on the Committee, who probably had the greatest philosophical difficulties in adopting that approach, are not present to hear me say so. I also accept that that means that they kept their powder dry; they remained free to bring out their political objections later in the legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I welcome and support each of the three purposes of the draft Bill. I believe that reformed and enhanced community health councils will be the right people's watchdog for the health service in Wales. As an ex-member of a community health council, I believe that it is vital that the scrutiny role and the advocacy role are tied together in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Wales Centre for Health, with its advice, research and training remit, can give independent assessment and support that will provide a hub for partnership between the various sectors that provide or utilise information or evidence on health questions. I am confident that Health Professions Wales is a step forward, building on the remit of the old Welsh National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting to include health care support workers and allowing the inclusion of other health care professions over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just I, or the Committee, who supports the objective. Just about everyone who gave or submitted evidence to us began by expressing general support for the intentions of the draft legislation, although some had specific concerns, questions or criticisms. It is those that I should like to address briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking first at the provision for community health councils, we were asked whether there should be provision in the Bill to ensure that CHCs became more truly representative of the communities that they spoke for in terms of sex, age, class, race, disability and so on. In the main, we thought that that was a subject for the Assembly and the CHCs themselves to grapple with, possibly in secondary legislation. However, we believed that an important way of enabling younger working people to participate was to give CHC members a statutory right to time off work for their public duties. That really only brings those duties in line with other forms of public duty. If we are looking for an enhanced role for CHCs, that is something that we need to take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also considered whether the Bill should require the coterminosity of local health board boundaries and CHC boundaries. We understood the strength of the argument but in the end felt that that was a matter for the Assembly. The draft Bill gives the Assembly the power to set CHC boundaries as it sees fit. We thought that that was right, but that local health board boundaries should be a primary consideration when it comes to drawing them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
We were also asked whether the Bill should go even further in allowing the remit for CHCs to be extended. At present, the draft Bill plans to empower CHCs to deal with private homes and primary care providers as well as carry out their traditional functions in hospitals and other institutions. The representatives of community health councils were happy with the proposals in the draft Bill but worried about any further extension without resources and training to match.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought—and the Committee agreed—that we should give the National Assembly the power to extend the scope of CHC powers to include inspecting premises and requiring information anywhere and from anyone involved in the provision of publicly funded health care. The draft Bill does not include a requirement for the provision of information. In the question-and-answer session that we had with Ministers, they acknowledged that omission, and I am sure that that measure will find its way into the final Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of the remit of CHCs may not happen in the near future, but now is the time that we should provide such power. I should like them to become involved in prisons and young offender institutions. That suggestion is a result of a Select Committee inquiry into young people from Wales who are in prison. One of our main worries after visiting men and women prisoners in Bristol was the absence of appropriate medical assessment and care facilities, especially psychiatric assessment and care. I know that prisons have their own inspection and lay visitor systems, but inspections by a group of informed people who could make a direct comparison between health provision in prison and outside it would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last matter that I wish to draw to the Committee's attention could be described as a "Who watches the watchdog?" question. Most of the evidence that the Select Committee received centred on the importance of protecting the independence of CHCs and maintaining their responsibilities to their local communities. However, Professor Warner of the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care placed equal emphasis on the consistency of performance of CHCs throughout Wales and their accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one stage, it was envisaged that the Association of Welsh Community Health Councils would have a performance management and central accountability function, but its role now seems to be more supportive and advisory. A regular reporting system from CHCs to the association and from the association to the Assembly would at least provide a monitoring base to assist and encourage better performance. The Assembly will need to keep an eye on that, but the Committee recognised that, to keep a balance between the need for locally based independent CHCs and consistency of performance throughout Wales, it would be better in the long term to come down on the side of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that worry about the independence of the Wales Centre for Health was also an issue when we were taking evidence. Under the draft Bill, the Wales Centre for Health will be obliged to comply with any direction of the National
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Assembly. Understandably, that set alarm bells ringing about the ability of the centre to provide independent information and advice. Moreover, worry was expressed about the public perception of the centre if it were believed to be unduly influenced by the Assembly. Neither the Assembly nor the Government envisage the control that such witnesses feared, but the draft Bill needs to be changed explicitly to limit the Assembly's powers of direction over the Wales Centre for Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We came across similar worries when we investigated the creation of Health Professions Wales. As drafted, the Bill provides the Assembly with the power to direct it. The Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Royal College of Nursing were worried about that power because, as drafted, they feared that the Bill could undermine the autonomy of Health Professions Wales or even that, under direction from the Assembly, it might run counter to the requirements of the Nursing and Midwifery Council or the Health Professions Council. Ministers have made it clear that that is not the intention of the clause, but a requirement to consult in respect of functions carried out by Health Professions Wales, where the Nursing and Midwifery Council or the Health Professions Council has a role, is eminently sensible and would relieve worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most organisations and individuals who gave evidence to the Select Committee declared their support for the devolution settlement. Many urged that the legislation should be as wide as possible, so that the Assembly could be empowered to pursue its direction through secondary legislation. However, there was some questioning of the plan for Wales to lead the way in the regulation of health care support workers, especially if that involved the production of a code of conduct. Some organisations considered that that should be dealt with on a United Kingdom-wide basis. In evidence, the Welsh Assembly Health Minister assured us that it was envisaged that United Kingdom regulatory standards for health care workers should and would be established. Indeed, I gained the impression that the initiative being taken in Wales is likely to bring closer that much-needed regulatory framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee commented on many other important aspects of the Bill and proposed some changes. I have chosen a few issues that were raised by some important contributors to the delivery of health services in Wales. They focused on matters that we must deal with in the post-devolution United Kingdom in the process of lawmaking for Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South spoke again today about making history in this pre-legislative scrutiny exercise. I think that it is true that the Bill is important, not only because of the measures that it contains, but because it demonstrates the sorts of issues that we will always have to face from now on when we deal with primary legislation for Wales. We do not serve the cause of devolution or good government for Wales if we frame legislation in a way that gives the impression that power is being
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
centralised in the Welsh Assembly Government in Cardiff, especially as—with community health councils, the Wales Centre for Health and Health Professions Wales in this Bill—that is not what the Assembly itself intends.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a landmark event, because it gives us the opportunity to show that the Welsh Grand Committee can make mature and constructive contributions to the drafting of legislation. For many of us, this process has been long overdue, but we welcome it because, assuming that we can prove our ability to contribute constructively to the development of legislation, this might be the beginning of something that we have long awaited—observing a listening Government taking on board serious and sensible recommendations when legislation is still flexible enough to be positively influenced by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel particularly qualified to talk about the health service because it saved my life in 1998 after I had had a serious accident. I fell 30 m when the paraglider that I was attempting to fly deflated above my head. Llanidloes hospital was largely responsible for initially stabilising my condition, and Royal Shrewsbury hospital got me through the critical hours that I spent hovering between life and death. Thereafter, Gobowen hospital, which is probably one of the world's leading orthopaedic institutions, helped me to get back on my feet. After the accident, Glyn Davies, a Conservative Assembly Member, saw me hobbling around Newtown and said, with visible disappointment, "Ah, Lembit, you were 10 feet short of a by-election." I have never forgotten that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lesson that I learned at that time was that all the elements of the health service perform exceptionally well in the great majority of life-or-death crises. Its emergency provision is not absolutely perfect, but the overwhelming majority of the Welsh public feel that it does not make a drama out of a crisis, and that it does all that it possibly can to help people. Therefore, this Bill offers us an opportunity to improve a health service that, by and large, works extremely hard. It might be starved of resources, but the members of its professions are very committed. It would be hard to believe that many of them work in the health service for the money; they work for it because they love what they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats welcome the Bill. As currently drafted, it covers sensibly and strategically the evolution of the Association of Welsh Community
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Health Councils, the Wales Centre for Health, and the Health Professions Wales organisation. I suspect that the Bill would not exist in its current form if the Welsh Assembly had not come into being. One reason why this draft Bill is so important is that it is beginning to show the evolution of a realistic partnership among the Welsh Assembly, Welsh health professionals and Westminster, which is seeking to design health provision that specifically fits the needs of Wales, although I will mention one potential consequence of divergence in Welsh Assembly and Westminster policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wholly constructive that Westminster now shows its genuine commitment to working with and listening to the needs of Wales as outlined by the Welsh Assembly and others. In that sense, as we look through the Bill, it is important that we make constructive and specific recommendations for improvement. Should he catch your eye, Mr. Griffiths, my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), who is a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee, will make specific suggestions. Some of those come from Liz Hewitt of the Royal College of Nursing, who very helpfully gave us some specific guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's speech before he finished, which is difficult to judge. I tried unsuccessfully to intervene on the hon. Member for Caernarfon. Although I accept that they may wish to add some of their own recommendations, do the Liberal Democrats support each of the 22 in our report? I should have liked to put that question to the hon. Member for Caernarfon, who spoke for Plaid Cymru.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We broadly agree with most of the recommendations, although we have specific issues with one of them. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire will discuss that in detail, and the hon. Member for Clwyd, South may wish to intervene at that point. I do not pretend to share the knowledge of members of the Select Committee because this is not an opportunity for us to grandstand and provide our perspective on issues about which we may not necessarily be as well qualified to talk. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that it is more appropriate for me to leave it to my hon. Friend to talk in detail about such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On coterminosity, we have, as hon. Members know, more than one community health council in Powys. We believe that a degree of flexibility is necessary so that community health councils naturally cover the geographical flow of patients to their local provision. In our view, therefore, it would be dogmatic to insist on coterminosity based on obvious but not necessarily appropriate boundaries. That is a matter for further discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important that we ensure that the health professional representatives are on board at all points between now and the evolution of the final Bill. In fairness, that has already taken place to a large extent, thanks to the way in which the Select Committee conducted its activities. It becomes really important when we discuss the detail. We sometimes generate unintended consequences. In examining the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
way in which the three particular bodies are designed, we must not build in any restriction or limit what the Health Professions Wales can do to ensure that regulation is effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the same token, it is important that the Wales Centre for Health embraces a cross-Wales brief. In large part it will be geographically connected to the Welsh Assembly. However, with modern technology, there is no reason why any part of Wales should feel excluded from the centre's activities. Liz Hewitt told me that she imagined that the centre would largely be a virtual Wales Centre for Health, using modern technology to ensure that nobody is excluded. As far as they go, the provisions make that possible. However, it may be necessary to state that intention more explicitly in the final Bill, and include some of the mechanisms that one would expect to be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community health councils are perhaps the most obvious example of potential divergence between England and Wales. To the credit of the Government and those who have framed the Bill, representations from people throughout Wales have been listened to. It will be interesting to contrast the operation of community health councils in Wales with activities in England, and compare like with like to see which is more effective. If we are effective in implementing the Bill expeditiously, there will be pressure and an assumption that we will get better value for money from the health service in Wales than we have in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru Members have asked questions and read a long line of statistics that imply that Welsh health is not performing well. Let us remember that there is no quick fix to issues that require long-term investment. The obvious reason why waiting lists are so long in Wales is that we cannot physically recruit and train sufficient staff quickly enough to turn round the problems that we have observed during many decades in which there was underfunding of the health service. We should have realistic expectations of what the Bill can and cannot do. It is not an alternative to proper resourcing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the same token, even if we create a more efficient health service, we are unlikely to create a less expensive one because, as life expectancy increases, the significant expenditure that occurs toward the end of a person's life will be shunted to a higher age. It would be wrong to pretend that health care will become less expensive in Wales, although it might be more effective. Life expectancy and the incidence of disease might be more meaningful measures than the cost of treating an individual from cradle to grave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the system of feedback on draft Bills is to work, we must recognise what the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) said about taking a Select Committee approach rather than a party political approach. I am not convinced that simply reeling off the health service's problems is useful feedback to civil servants and Ministers while we are considering a clearly focused and specific Bill to which we should contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constructive approach is not necessarily one in which there are no differences of opinion. On 7 May in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
the Assembly, a motion moved by Plaid Cymru generated much debate about the health service and the Barnett formula. The Assembly divided on several issues, and Liberal Democrats opposed the motion. We felt that what Plaid Cymru Assembly Members said about the NHS with regard to consequentials was too restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly deal with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as it is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a point of order. The matter arose yesterday during a debate on the radio. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) said that he was looking for a needs-based formula, and I said that that was unfortunate because his colleagues voted against that on 7 May. Liberal Democrats say one thing in Wales and another in Westminster. It is the same old story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my clever way, I have managed to prompt the comment from the hon. Gentleman for which I had hoped. We had a private discussion after a debate yesterday, and I shall address the point for 30 seconds before I conclude my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion on 7 May addressed three things: the Barnett formula, the NHS and European funding. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, Liberal Democrats proposed an amendment to the motion, which was defeated. We felt obliged to vote against the motion because we disagreed with parts 2 and 3 of it. I told the hon. Gentleman that I would publicly apologise if he could show that we voted against the Barnett formula. I hope that he will understand in the spirit of our conversation that we voted against other parts of the motion but not those that related to the Barnett formula. The hon. Gentleman is a grown-up politician who understands how things work, and I hope that I have clarified the point to his satisfaction, although he was perfectly entitled to raise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, there is a risk of divergence between Westminster and Cardiff, which I believe will happen. If this process is successful and repeated in future, Members of Parliament who represent Wales will be drawn into discussions that will often be sponsored and promoted by the Welsh Assembly and that lead us away from policies that will apply to England and occasionally Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a healthy consequence of devolution, but we must recognise that if that happens we shall increasingly be required to regard politics as a competition, not a war, and we must be able to tolerate the fact that different solutions will fit different regions of the United Kingdom. That is a different way of looking at politics. It will provide us with both the opportunity for better solutions for Wales and a hostage to fortune, as there will be a danger of our acting hypocritically by condemning different solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are serious about devolution, we must always consider the outcomes that we intend rather than the cheap shots that may be presented to us in the short term. The latter are boomerang issues; if we try to
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
score short-term gains, sooner or later we shall be found out. I therefore hope that a consequence of the consultation is the same as one of the consequences of devolution: a more mature approach to policy making in both Westminster and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr. Griffiths. I am a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee. Its Chairman and my hon. Friend the Member for Gower have detailed most of its recommendations, and I shall not repeat them. The process was a valuable way of considering draft legislation. The Bill is short and is not very contentious. That meant that there were no fiery discussions. However, it was an important way of carefully examining how the health service would work in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us sat in on a sitting of the Health and Social Services Committee of the Assembly, which I found an interesting experience. Although we could not contribute, it was the first time that I had seen how Assembly Committees work. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) has left the Room, but it was interesting to hear his party passionately argue for coterminosity for community health council boundaries, which he obviously—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] There was no consultation, shall we say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also interesting to watch all parties attempt to include in the Bill other aspects of health promotion that we all passionately support. It has not been possible to include those wider-ranging issues, as they do not fall under the scope of the Bill, which we wanted to succeed. It was therefore not possible to include some causes about which I am sure that hon. Members from all parties on the Welsh Affairs Committee agreed, especially the smoking issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been an interesting process, and it is probably the way in which to approach the matter. The Grand Committee is too big for the sort of discussions that we were able to have on the smaller Welsh Affairs Committee, where party issues sink into the background and we try to work as a group, which would produce better legislation. I hope that that is an example of what will happen a lot in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus my remarks on CHCs as they are the main point of the Bill, although the other two bodies that it will create are important. The Assembly's regulation of health support workers is an important step forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gower said, some concern was expressed about Wales leading the way in the matter and about whether there would be a code of conduct, but we generally felt that it would be good for Wales to lead the way. Involving health support workers is important. The Wales Centre for Health is a good aspect to which our proposals to ensure its independence would add.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The meat of the Bill relates to how CHCs develop. We have talked a lot about divergence, and it is good that Wales has looked at what the people want and has kept CHCs. Devolution means going different ways in different parts of the UK. The fact that Wales recognised public feeling on the importance of CHCs means that the proposals have been universally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
welcomed, certainly by all those who gave evidence to us. We did not hear a dissenting voice over keeping strengthening the CHCs. It was good to be in on that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had good experience of the community health council in Cardiff, which has provided an advocacy service. I have been personally involved in a number of the cases that it has taken up. My constituency contains the University of Wales hospital, Velindre hospital and Whitchurch hospital, so has a huge concentration of health resources. I have been very involved in many health issues. The hon. Member for Caernarfon mentioned the buildings in which some of our services are provided, and I too have such buildings in my constituency. Whitchurch hospital is a very old, Victorian building and, basically, not fit for people with mental health problems to stay in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are tackling such issues through the health service in Wales, but it is very important that bodies such as CHCs are strengthened and that their representatives can go into buildings such as Whitchurch and say strongly that the conditions are not fit. There are parts of Whitchurch hospital about which the staff and management have enormous concerns. We are moving towards building a new mental health facility in Whitchurch to replace that hospital. It is in such matters that I see CHCs playing a very strong role—looking at that sort of accommodation and making their views strongly known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the advocacy service provided by CHCs is that, in many cases, it will speak for the most vulnerable patients who use the health service. There is no doubt in my mind that those vulnerable people include the mentally ill and those suffering mental health problems. I am very concerned that that aspect of advocacy is not lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that everyone knows that some 47 per cent, of NHS premises in Wales are deficient in some way, shape or form. Does the hon. Lady envisage giving the CHCs extra powers so that instead of only saying that properties are less good than they should be, they perhaps have the power to direct money towards improving the facilities available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; I see the CHCs as having the power to highlight the conditions that people are living in and in that way to put pressure on the authorities to change those conditions. They have done that in several cases. As I said, there is a plan for a new 200-bed hospital in my constituency to replace the accommodation in poor condition at Whitchurch hospital. The visits that receive publicity that CHCs make to see how the health service is operating are very important, as is the fact that they are sometimes unannounced. We all know, as many Members have said today, that health service workers do a good job and work hard, but circumstances mean that there are inevitably things that are not right. That is inevitable in any system. CHCs play an important role in highlighting that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
It is important that CHCs use existing expertise to work with mentally ill patients, for example, and that and their advocacy services are carried out in close conjunction with the bodies that have that expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall visiting women in prison in Gloucestershire. An issue raised during that visit, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gower alluded, was the mental health problems suffered by many prisoners. Would she welcome a widening of community health councils' remit so that they could act as advocates on behalf of such women prisoners outside Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our Committee discussed widening CHCs' remit, and I believe that we enabled that to happen without saying that it was something that CHCs must do at the moment—CHCs were concerned about taking on too much with too limited resources. It is possible for their remit to be widened in future if the recommendations of the Welsh Affairs Committee are taken on board without being returned to Westminster for further legislation, as is enshrined in the Committee's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that women such as those to whom my hon. Friend has referred have access to CHCs, which should look at people who are in prison. The point has been made about prisoners many times today because there is a good deal of concern about the health service in prisons and in particular, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gower mentioned, the psychiatric service. The psychiatric service is desperately needed in prison because a large percentage of people who are committed to prison have psychiatric problems, and we must recognise that. When we conducted the young offenders inquiry and visited young offenders from Wales who were living in prisons outside Wales, the staff told us that one of their greatest frustrations was not being able to access skilled psychiatric help in order to help young people in their care, which is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady's point, but surely the difficulty is the artificial organisation of the prison health service and the need for all prisoners with psychiatric problems to come directly under the NHS without any separation. Is it not the case that most prisoners currently get a second-class health service? We need to bring the health service directly into prisons and allow the CHCs to follow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Psychiatric services form one of the big issues. It is certainly difficult to get psychiatric care in the community for adolescents because not many psychiatrists work in that field, and it is even more difficult in the Prison Service. There is a huge opportunity for the CHCs to work with experts in the mental health service, and they should be able to make a difference with their extended remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other group that it is important to mention is children. There is no doubt that to act as an advocate for a child one has to have expert knowledge and training relating to children. One mistake that many of us have probably made as constituency MPs is to question a child and expect them to respond. In taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
on issues involving children, one has to know ways in which to get a child to respond. Much work has been done on art with children, playing with children or taking children out and working with them in order for them to express their deep feelings about something that may have happened to them in the health system. It is important that the CHCs work very closely with children's advocacy services, which will have worked for many years on communicating with children and the presentation of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore good that the advocacy service of the CHCs will, as a result of the Bill and the recommendations of the Welsh Affairs Committee, this Committee and the Assembly, provide a more uniform service throughout Wales. At the moment advocacy services are patchy. In Cardiff, for example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
we have been able to use the advocacy service, and in the north some local authorities pay for an advocacy worker to be attached to the CHCs, but as a whole one cannot guarantee that the CHCs will provide an advocacy service. It will be possible to improve the service that the CHCs give, and advocacy is one of the most important roles that they will deliver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
