	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Budget Statement and its implications for Wales.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points have arisen from this morning's sitting. Many members of the Committee have incorrectly inferred that my poor physical condition is a direct result of my meeting with the Campaign for Real Ale. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There you go. Hon. Members seem unable to contain themselves before drinks this evening. CAMRA promotes responsible drinking. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) is no more a hardened drinker than I am, and he is fine and I am not, I can assure hon. Members that my condition is definitely due to the food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, this morning I drew attention to the fact that the Government had included motor bikes as a key part of their strategy. I suggest to the Ministers that when they are in conversation with their opposite numbers in the Assembly, they could consider ways of promoting motor cycles as a commuting solution. I stress that it is important to think about the safety aspects, too. However, as long as there is proper training, that would be a great and positive way to implement the changes in the Budget to the vehicle excise duty on to two-wheelers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resolution 33 on the deduction of expenditure involving crime means that payments made abroad for activities that would be illegal in the United Kingdom, such as bribes, will no longer be tax-deductible. The Liberal Democrats argued for that in the past. Now, no one can get tax back on illegal activities abroad. It is as plain as day that that is sensible, and I am glad that the Government have introduced that resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other elements of the Budget that I think were good. The changes to stamp duty will evidently bring in more money and have the support of the Liberal Democrats. Resolution 58 on the climate change levy, combined heat and power stations and renewable sources, and other resolutions connected with it, are really important. As climate change accelerates—and I fear that it will—we will spend more time talking about the consequences of environmental change and our responsibilities to stop it. It is a sad fact of life that human nature causes us to pay attention to things that affect us directly, although I hope that it will not come to that. I hope that we, as a truly internationalist country, will think about people in Bangladesh and elsewhere who need climate change levy legislation to bite. Perhaps we are not accelerating our environmental credentials fast enough. Time will tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Of course, there are matters with which we do not agree. Let me deal with the issue that vexed the Committee most this morning: the continuing debate about whether national insurance is an acceptable way of raising money to fund the health service. The Liberal Democrats have always argued for that kind of increase in expenditure, and it would be churlish not to compliment the Government on listening to Liberal Democrat advice yet again. The issue is how, not whether, we raise the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make three observations, although I accept that there will be different views in the Room. Most members of the public regard the increase in national insurance contributions as an increase in direct taxation. They do not think that national insurance is very different from income tax. I understand that the Government do not want it to be thought of in that way because they promised at the general election not to raise income tax. That is a problem for them. However, it was a pity that they made that pledge, and in my opening remarks I spoke about the benefits of being straight with the public. Perhaps they missed their opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Divisions on the resolutions, we did not formally support the national insurance changes because we have not yet voted on them, as they have not been discussed. We voted against resolution 21 because we wanted to draw a line in the sand to show that our policy is different from the Government's. We think that an increase in income tax would be better. If we were in government, we would propose putting a penny on income tax for education, and increasing the top rate of income tax to 50p in the pound—an increase of 10p in the pound—for those who earn more than £100,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) is not here. He needs to explain the logic of the Conservative party's view, given that for much of the time between 1979 and 1997, under a Conservative Government, the top rate of tax was 60 per cent. We do not even propose to go as far as the Conservatives did for a large proportion of their time in government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, a 50 per cent. top tax rate would raise an amount comparable to that which the Chancellor will raise through national insurance. We oppose using national insurance as the vehicle because that is not fair. The Secretary of State said this morning that it was reasonable to expect employers to pay. We think differently; we believe that income tax is the most transparent, sensible and fair way to raise the money. We do not need to labour the point, as it is a simple one, and ultimately it is a judgment call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pretty certain that the Government have not got away with the national insurance increase with the general public. There is dissatisfaction among small businesses, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) said. To be parochial for a moment, many small businesses directly involved in agriculture in rural areas will be affected. I hope that I have at least clarified the difference of opinion between the Liberal Democrats and the Government on the matter, although we might simply have to continue to differ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
A measure that directly affects some parts of Wales, but not my constituency, and that we must take seriously, is the introduction of a petroleum extraction activities levy that will raise £600 million. That move is rather a surprise, and it was made without consultation. The Government only recently completed a review of the North sea tax regime that decided against significant change. I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain in his summation why there was no new consultation on the subject, and why the Government thought it acceptable to introduce what is a pretty much a windfall tax on the petroleum industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The profit in the oil business is tempting to any Government, but it creates suspicion when changes are made unilaterally under a formal process. I have talked to members of British Petroleum, although I have no declarable or registered interest in the matter. I sense that they are happy to work proactively with the Government, so it is a bit of a shame that the matter slid, and that the Government introduced the tax at a time when it would be hard for the petroleum industry to respond and garner the support of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have implied what we would do had we been in Government—added 1p on income tax for education, and 10p to the top rate of income tax for health. One can see that the Liberal Democrats' and the Government's processes are slightly different, but on outcome, I can say unequivocally that the Government are on the right lines in putting significant extra expenditure into health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to explore briefly what Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives say on that matter. My remarks are intended to engender debate. Hon. Members from the Welsh nationalist Benches may answer my questions in later speeches, or intervene on me now. There continue to be inconsistencies in Plaid Cymru's approach to the economy in Welsh Grand Committee debates. I can understand that the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) felt rather put upon earlier, when some of us were pushing him to clarify the long-term strategic goals of the Welsh nationalists. We wanted to know whether that goal was independence or something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question was significant because Plaid Cymru's strategic goals are bound to inform how they would do the job if they were in government in the National Assembly for Wales. We cannot get away from that. I think that it is reasonable for them to give members of the public, who will be invited to vote in the Assembly elections in 2003, a big-picture sense of what is going on. I was left unsatisfied about whether the long-term intention of Plaid Cymru was independence, which was what the hon. Gentleman implied, or whether it has a different strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also heard it said that Plaid Cymru wants Wales to be a nation state with its own seat in the European Union. That can happen only if Wales becomes independent. If the hon. Gentlemen would explain those core issues in a way that is clear to us all,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
it might be easier to understand the economic consequences of Plaid Cymru's plans for Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to make criticisms, and I am happy enough to criticise the Government when I can see a better way of doing something, but several matters were left hanging in the air, such as the loss of 40,000 manufacturing jobs. There are many complex reasons for that sort of thing, and I am not here to lecture the Welsh nationalists, but it would be easier to view their position with credibility if they explained why the problem occurred and how Plaid Cymru would deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those points of view are not too inflammatory, and I sincerely hope that the Welsh nationalist Members can reply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the Conservatives, my task is even more difficult. Although I have a sense of Plaid Cymru having a direction and a commitment to Wales, I simply cannot understand what Conservative party policy is—on funding the NHS, for example. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Bryant) took part in a recent radio debate in which we sought clarification of how the Conservatives would fund the NHS. The more that was said, the more confusing it became. At one point, we heard a Conservative representative saying that money was not the main problem, but, the next moment, he complained that not enough was available and made other pecuniary points about the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under pressure, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley did the same thing. He seemed to fall back on a belief based on fuzzy logic—that restructuring could actually win the extra money. At the same time, the Conservatives consistently criticise the Government for restructuring the health service. I am not saying that there is no strategy, but I cannot see one. Once again, if the Conservatives want to be taken seriously, they should define where they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Yorkshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Conservative party are not alone in saying that money is not the whole answer to the problems in the NHS? For example, is he aware that the British Medical Association has made similar comments? The secretary of the BMA in Wales, Bob Broughton, also believes that money is not the only solution, and that extra cash could be better channelled into areas that make a difference. In his view, Wales is short of 100 GPs. It is not only the Conservatives who say that problems in the NHS are partly caused by poor management. On his earlier point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is an intervention, not a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Griffiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My response is straightforward. The right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) seems to be saying that the Conservative party is committed to restructuring. However, there is an irony, because several things that he appeared to condemning were changes introduced between 1979 and 1997. Conservative Members are perfectly entitled to change their position, but it would be helpful to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
know which of those policies they have explicitly abandoned, and with what they have been replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not seeking an apology for those years, but there is a common perception that probably harmed the Conservatives in the general elections in 1997 and 2001—the Conservatives did a lot of damage to the health service with the changes that they made. To move forward, they should be clear about what they have abandoned from their previous strategic position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley said very little about where the money would come from. Once again—as we saw in Prime Minister's Questions today—when pushed on that point, the Conservatives do not seem able or willing to answer. In the radio interview that the hon. Member for Rhondda and I took part in, the Assembly Member speaking on behalf of the Conservatives actually suggested the American model as a good way forward. He implied that Medicare was preferable. The hon. Member for Rhondda made a forceful response by saying that few people in Wales would share that view, and I agree. They are in a bit of a mess, which they need to resolve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Conservative Assembly Member who spoke on the radio was the Assembly Member for Monmouth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my intention to give the individual free publicity, but it was the Assembly Member for Monmouth. We can provide copies of the tape to the hon. Gentleman for a reasonable fee—all money going to the health service, of course. Since I have now committed myself to trying to take a positive view of politics, I invite the Conservative party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a minute. I invite the Conservative party to accept my comments as constructive feedback and criticism, and as an open door for it to come up with creative solutions to improve the health service in Wales, which is what the hon. Member for Ribble Valley said he wanted, on a cross-party basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman think that his solution will work? He talks about raising higher-rate tax, but is he aware that when Lord Lawson was Chancellor of the Exchequer and reduced higher-rate tax, the tax yield went up, not down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the judgment of the Liberal Democrats that a net return comparable to that from the national insurance change would be achieved by increasing tax. A certain amount of circumstantial evidence exists either way, and hon. Members can make their judgment about whom they agree with. I intuitively feel that a tax rise that puts a significant additional burden on the Secretary of State for Wales would not be regarded as unreasonable, given that the rest of us do not earn anything like £100,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire also rightly pointed out that if a pensioner earns more than £100,000, it is probably not unreasonable to expect them to pay a little more tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
With the extra money, we have an opportunity to make a difference to Welsh life and to the quality of health provision in Wales. I hope that we can support the Welsh Assembly in relevant ways that cut between Westminster and Cardiff to ensure that it gets the money, and that no weasel ways restrict that. Perhaps more importantly, we need to find creative ways of working together to achieve benefits in transport provision, health, education and so forth. In my judgment, the Liberal Democrat-led Government in Cardiff have been successful. [HON. MEMBERS: "Led?"]. At least morally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be positive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being very positive about my party, thank you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly shows that parties that work together towards outcomes, rather than party-hacking, can make a significant difference. The Budget gives us the opportunity to make a step-change improvement in the public services available in Wales. It would have been nice if that had happened five years ago, but it could not have occurred unless the Liberal Democrats had been swept to power in 1997—the chance for that will come again. In the meantime, it is good to see the Labour party accepting the early stages of a Liberal Democrat Budget. We can carry it on after 2006.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Chancellor gave his Budget statement last week, I was given special dispensation to be absent from the House so that I could attend the opening of a spring show by a manufacturing company in my constituency. In the past 15 to 20 years there have been few occasions on which a local company has been able to show confidence by holding such an event to sell its wares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company, Faun Municipal, is the second largest manufacturer of environmental waste trucks in the United Kingdom, and more than 50 per cent. of its work force is based in my constituency. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is right to quote the comments of the CBI in Wales about business confidence: that is exactly what the local business community told me, although that is not to discount the remaining problems of manufacturing, such as the strength of the pound, which several hon. Members have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have waited a long time for a Budget of this nature—a tax-and-spend Budget, not for the sake of it, but for the right reasons; a Budget that is progressive, fair and apt. I fully understand that in the first five years of the Labour Government there was a need to put the economy back on track and to lay strong foundations on which to build a fairer and more just society. I applaud the Chancellor's previous Budgets, which have aided my constituents greatly, particularly pensioners, low-income families and small businesses. The GMB union summed it up in its slogan about the Budget, "Nice one Gordon! (Again)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the massive additional spending on the national health service, to which many have referred. I am pleased that the National Assembly or the Welsh
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
Executive have decided to introduce that money in stages, to provide year-on-year increases until 2007–08. That five-year programme of investment in our national health service is unique and it will have a profound effect on all our constituencies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that I will have the opportunity in the House to talk about the NHS and the reforms that need to go with that investment, so today I will concentrate on the implications of the Chancellor's Budget statement and its provision for pensioners and families in Wales. Before doing so, I will touch on education and the spending that the Chancellor announced in that respect. I refer to the direct payments of £714,000 to typical secondary schools, and the spending on primary schools. Although that is a devolved matter, it would be unfair if head teachers and governors of typical secondary schools in Wales were not to have the additional £15,000 grant, or the equivalent grant of £5,500 to primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in favour of Welsh solutions to Welsh issues, but I believe that Welsh schools will be short-changed if the money goes to the local education authority and teachers do not get those direct grants. I hope that the Secretary of State will take that up with the First Minister and the Welsh Executive. I believe that our schools deserve the maximum that is on offer from the Chancellor, because equipment costs the same in Wales and every penny in schools' budgets counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In each Budget since 1997, families have been central to the Chancellor's plans. We have seen the introduction of the working families tax credit, a record increase in universal child benefit—now worth £15.75 for the first child—and the raising of tax thresholds to assist the lower paid and help people into work. As a welfare adviser prior to entering Parliament, I saw the immediate effect that that assistance had on low-income families in my area. However, while the intent and the effect were immediate, the system was, and remains, complex. It is complex for recipients, employers who administer the credit, benefit agencies, local authorities and welfare advisers—and, I confess, quite complex for Members of Parliament who have to deal with it in their surgeries. That is why I welcome the Chancellor's merging of the tax credits for families and the introduction of a more seamless benefit for families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only has the system been complex in the past, but it has penalised single-income families. The new means test will be based on parents' joint income, rather than the income of the highest earner. That is fairer, simpler and, I believe, more rewarding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to explain that the Chancellor is dealing with that by merging the systems into one seamless tax credit. I will come on to pensions a little later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the cash will be paid to the main carer, who is usually, but not always, the mother, as my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) said this morning. The cash will offer a major boost to the incomes of the many families in my constituency whose income is less than £50,000 a year. The new child tax credit will give them up to £1,400, which is equivalent to £26.50 a week and therefore a quite significant credit to those families. It tapers down to about £800 for households with incomes of up to £58,000, of which there are not many in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new benefit will offset any increase in national insurance that those families will face due to the 1 per cent. increase. Although the new tax credit will be easier to access in theory, an awareness campaign is needed—the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) mentioned that. We need greater awareness to enable the tax credit's intended recipients to get their entitlement. Currently, only 72 per cent. of eligible families have applied for the working families tax credit, which is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit measures announced in the Budget will ensure that in Wales more than 50 per cent. of families with children will be better off, and those with below-average earnings of less than £21,000 will be considerably better off. That will benefit areas such as mine, which is a low-pay area. On average, direct tax on families has gone down to its lowest level for many decades. The Child Poverty Action Group has given a broad welcome to the ongoing commitment to increase tax benefits and tax credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also good news for low-paid childless couples aged over 25 in Wales. The working tax credit guarantees a couple in full-time work a weekly income of £183, and guarantees take-home pay of £154 for single people. The package of benefits reflects the decision, which I welcome, to help families with the costs of registered child carers working in their homes. That is a victory for parents who work, and it opens up the way to employing nannies, who are in many ways like family members and grandparents, to help with child care duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talking of grandparents, pensioners are major beneficiaries of the Budget. In the pre-Budget report, the Chancellor announced that the £200 winter fuel allowance will be paid each and every year, and he rightly honoured that pledge in the Budget. It was wrong of the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr to say that it is a cut. In the run-up to the general election, Plaid Cymru was telling me that it was a one-off gimmick. It is not. It has real meaning for those who receive it. That tax-free grant will be welcome in every household. It is not a gimmick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the success of the national health service, people are living longer. The Chancellor's announcement of an increase in thresholds for people aged over 75 will bring many pensioners out of tax altogether. I also welcome the pension credit, which has given the average pensioner household a saving of about £1,500 since 1997. Charities such as Age Concern and Help the Aged have welcomed it, too. Details of the additional cash for social services have, again, not been announced, but when they are, I hope that we will find that it helps with community care and care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
The tax credits for pensioners introduced by the Chancellor are complex. In future, I hope that he will look for an all-embracing, seamless way in which to get tax credits in one payment. He has done that with the working families tax credit, and that is the way forward. As Age Concern has said, without a single payment, there is a danger that the Government, rather than pensioners, will end up in credit. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to work with charities and the benefit agencies to heighten awareness of the credit and ensure that pensioners get their full entitlement. It is a responsibility of Members of Parliament to heighten awareness in their surgeries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the additional resources for public services, and the Chancellor was right to put that on national insurance contributions as opposed to the 1 p income tax increase on offer from other parties. Pensioners on very low incomes would have been penalised had the increase been on income tax. I have worked with people caught in the poverty trap: had there been a 1p income tax increase, they would have lost out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the 1p "on offer from other parties", and I take it he includes my party in that. In fact, not many pensioners in Wales would have been affected by a new 50 per cent. top rate for taxable income above £50,000—a measure which would raise £5.7 billion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point related to 1p on the lower band of income tax. As the hon. Gentleman says, many pensioners are not on high earnings, but it is still not right to penalise those on low earnings. That is why I support the minimum income guarantee, which helps to alleviate pensioner poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, the Liberal Democrats would have used an increase in the top rate to 50p in the pound for the health service, and an increase of a penny in the pound for education. If one manages the thresholds correctly, the nightmare scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes need not arise, and those pensions would not suffer on account of arrangements that the Chancellor could easily organise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that, but I will not repeat my point. The effect of putting a penny on income tax at the low rate would be cancelled if ceilings were low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that other Members want to speak in the debate, so I will begin winding up. The Budget was a long time coming. It provides the necessary long-term investment in the national health service and is progressive in the way in which it deals with national insurance. I welcome its seamless benefits for low-income families and the increase for pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pundits have said that the Chancellor has taken a gamble. In 	<i>The Guardian</i> yesterday, I read that more than 50 per cent. of Conservative supporters support the Budget. It is the type of gamble that I want the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take year on year. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] From a sedentary position, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentions 	<i>The Guardian</i>, but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
that statistic was also reflected in 	<i>The Times</i>, which is not a Labour newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) and for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) chided Opposition Members for voting in favour of the Budget in general while being critical of certain aspects of it. Such licence is allowed to Opposition Members, but is unfortunately not often allowed to Government Back Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in the past clearly stated our way of raising money, we feel free to repeat it because it has some worth, and I am going to repeat it again today. I took the Secretary of State's point about pensioners being exempt from national insurance, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) said, we have nothing against pensioners who have incomes of more than £100,000—whether that is dividend income, earned income, pensions or whatever—making a substantial contribution to the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy with the 1p increase in employer national insurance contribution. It does nothing for the health of the nation when businesses struggle and have to fight for survival. That struggle does nothing for the health of those trying to run such businesses, and nothing for the health of people who will be made redundant if such businesses fail. A tax on business is not a way to encourage good health in the nation, but is a way to put more and more people in danger of ill health and stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one aspect of the Budget on which we have not touched. The aggregates levy is perhaps a small matter, but is important to Wales. Wales's geographical and geological qualities make it an important source of aggregates. The House had agreed the principle of the levy before I was elected, and when I first heard about it, I was in favour, because it is an environmental tax that encourages the reuse of aggregates and discourages the quarrying of virgin aggregates. We all know the environmental problems that quarrying can cause to both the countryside and people's lives through the destruction of landscape, the release of dust and increased traffic movements. In principle, therefore, I was in favour of the aggregates tax. However, some of my constituents have drawn certain problems to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are in my constituency a number of quarries that obviously contribute to both the local economy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
and local employment. Several community councils wrote to me saying that they were very concerned about the effect that the aggregates levy would have on employment, not only of people who work in the quarries, but of those who drive the lorries—owner-drivers who make up the greater component of the transport system that moves aggregates about the countryside. I looked into the matter. The aggregates levy is £1.60 a tonne, which may not sound like a lot of money; however, the cost of aggregates coming out of the quarry is usually about £5 a tonne, so the duty on aggregates is 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also contacted by people from local authorities who were concerned about the effect that the levy would have on the cost of road maintenance and roadbuilding, and the effect that that would have in turn on local authority budgets. Obviously, if the price of aggregates goes up, the costs of housebuilding, construction, road maintenance and roadbuilding will be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for the aggregates levy are interesting, because the Government cannot give an estimate of how much virgin aggregates will be saved by it. In a sense, the tax is a good idea, but they have no idea what its effect will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that one of the reasons why the Government cannot explain what environmental savings will come from the aggregates levy, let alone the environmental cost of transporting aggregates over greater distances, is that the only research undertaken was a simple opinion poll by a company that has now gone bust, which asked local people if they would be prepared to pay a bit more to see the quarries in their area close?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the material to which the hon. Gentleman refers., As one who was a Member of the last Parliament, he has more experience I do, and he was probably present when the matter was discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue that has fallen out of discussion is the rebate that the Government were once considering giving to quarries that produced aggregates in a more environmentally friendly manner. It is possible to do that: for example, quarry operators can ensure that dust is suppressed and does not go into people's houses or the countryside, or they can ensure that good restoration plans are in place so that when the quarry comes to the end of its life, the site can be restored in a way that is fitting to the countryside and provides opportunities for leisure and recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify what the hon. Gentleman is saying? He voted for the NIC increases, but opposes them. He is in favour of the aggregates levy, but not for the quarries in his area. If the Government were to put a tax on fences, might it encourage him and some of his colleagues to get off them and actually make some decisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained my position on national insurance. I certainly was not going to vote one way and then another. I am just trying to ensure that the Government have a chance to reconsider the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
aggregates levy. Although I believe that it should be implemented, there are ways in which it can be more finely tuned to ensure that it achieves the environmental aims and objectives that it was set up to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend to give way. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise, Mr. Griffiths. I was not going to rise, but I really cannot contain myself any longer. Is it not completely unclear whether the Conservatives support the extra money? Is it not reasonable for us to express our concerns about the process of raising the money without necessarily opposing the investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is the case. I was about to say that a peculiar thing about the aggregates levy is that it raises no tax for the Treasury but is completely tax neutral. The Government propose that the money should be distributed. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley would be very pleased to note that one of the proposals is that it be used to reduce the employer's national insurance rate by 0.1 per cent. At least that would undo some of the harm that the Budget has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another proposal—one that I would like the Secretary of State to take up—is that the rest of the money be put into a sustainability fund, with the purpose of encouraging the restoration of quarries and enhancing the environment of the villages and communities around quarries. As I understand it, the Government have not yet come out with the proposals, criteria and guidelines for implementing their sustainability fund. They have an opportunity to examine two courses of action: giving rebates to quarries that quarry in an environmentally friendly way, and accelerating consideration of the sustainability fund so that communities within the range of quarries can benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On Monday, I was present at an inspirational lecture at the university of Wales, Bangor given by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume). I say "inspirational" because all present, including senior academics, the judiciary and many young students, listened in intense, concentrated silence as he recounted the paths towards peace in Northern Ireland that he has trodden during his lifetime. There were lessons for many in his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has been to my constituency before, and would be welcome again. He recounted the occasion when, as a child—of about 10 years old, I think—he attended an outdoor parliamentary meeting with his father. He felt himself caught up with the passions aroused by patriotic flag-waving. His father brought him down to earth by reminding him, "You can't eat a flag". That comment is relevant in Wales today, and I would add that the people of Wales cannot eat the graffiti, "Cymru i'r Cymry. English go home."

However, we may eat and thrive on the results of education, training and work. As one whose first language is Welsh, I recall the time when I was the constituency secretary of the late Lord Goronwy Roberts, a Member of this House for 29 years. He coined the election slogan, "Bydd gwaith yn cadw'r iaith"—"Employment will retain the language". That slogan is very relevant today as we discuss this year's Budget. If we have a sound, stable economy in our communities, our language and culture will flourish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales and in my constituency, the Budget has been well received. We in this House must not prejudge how the Welsh Assembly Government will apportion their budget. Health will, rightly, be of major concern to our colleagues in Cardiff, as will education. A better educated nation will be a healthier nation. In my constituency and in north Wales, the university of Wales, Bangor, has a direct role to play in enabling the nation to be healthier through education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In collaboration with the only other higher education institution in north Wales—the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education, or NEWI, in Wrexham—the university of Wales, Bangor has led the development of the community university in north Wales. That brings Bangor and NEWI into close partnership with the eight further education colleges in the region. The aim, very simply, is to provide a new opportunity and perhaps a second chance for those in north Wales who for whatever reason—geography, family or finance—have not previously had the opportunity to develop their full educational potential. By facilitating part-time study, and by providing clear paths for progression from further to higher education and more convenient local access points across the region, the community university is creating new opportunities. The people who have been given those opportunities will benefit further from the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second example of the pioneering work at Bangor is the talent identification programme. The university works with six schools in Wales—one in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen)—in areas where the social and economic indicators are low. The university works in those schools with children identified by their teachers as intellectually capable of university study but who, because of family background, would be unlikely even to think about applying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The university starts working with the children when they are about 13 years old, and continues to do so during the rest of their time at school. They are brought into the university to encourage them to understand that a university education is open to them. The scheme is now being extended to include parents. A statement from one school summed up the programme:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is about boosting self-esteem, confidence and ambition and about providing new horizons."</p></blockquote>
The programme is growing and reaching more and more young people each year. In that way, we are planning for the future—a future of prosperity for our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
In the last comprehensive spending review, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor kept his promise to the people of Wales. He did not let Wales down on objective 1 funding. Wales received a settlement over and above the Barnett formula. There are now new opportunities for making fundamental and lasting changes to our local economy. Unemployment in Wales is at its lowest for 27 years. Objective 1 funding through local partnerships can have a lasting impact on the region's economy by creating employment that is sustainable in the longer term. Again, my local university is already active in several partnerships, which are already seeing results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Budget gives confidence to education and to business. Some 98 per cent. of businesses in Wales are small or medium-sized and will benefit enormously from the Budget. Again, the university of Wales, Bangor, has been active, having long believed that one of the most effective ways to transfer knowledge from a university to business and industry is through the TCS—teaching company scheme—partnerships funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. In such partnerships, a university graduate works in a company for two years on a development project of particular commercial interest to that company. The project is jointly supervised by a university member of staff and the university's facilities are made available to support the development work. The partnerships have been very successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health and education are closely linked. Another recent and important development in my area has been the bid to establish a north Wales clinical school, which also reflects the theme of collaboration, as it has been put forward by a consortium comprising five partners from the north Wales health sector and three academic institutions. That development, important for the whole of north Wales, will widen access to medical education for the young people of our region, and increase the number of young doctors wishing to develop their careers in north Wales and who understand the needs of rural communities, including Welsh-speaking communities. I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to continue his dialogue with the ministerial team in the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that that scheme goes ahead. It is one reason why the extra resources announced for our national health service are vital to us in north Wales.

Most people have opened their speeches today on the subject of health. I will look at the other benefits that will arise from last week's historic Budget, especially those for the economy.

When I was in the Library earlier, I looked at the March 2002 statistics for unemployment. I noticed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
that my constituency saw the fourth highest drop in unemployment of the 659 constituencies in the country. The drop between March 2001 and March 2002 was from 1,452 to 1,115 people—23 per cent. in one year. Many Welsh Members should be pleased because the table showing the top 25 constituencies includes four in Wales. My constituency is top of the Welsh constituencies at No. 4 in the table, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) is at No. 5, with a 22 per cent. drop in unemployment, that of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) is at No. 10, with a 21 per cent. drop—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) is at No. 17, with a 20 per cent. drop. Those are fantastic figures. The Budgets that the Chancellor has introduced each year, with his other macroeconomic and microeconomic steps, have created a healthy, sustainable economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor's latest measures in last week's Budget will specifically benefit Wales. Opposition Members asked what he has done for small businesses, to which I responded that he had simplified VAT. We have thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises—probably more than anywhere else in the country—and the number is growing, especially in north-west Wales. Among micro-firms comprising of just one or two people, the Budget has gone down really well. In the county of Denbighshire last year, 68 new companies were created with the help of local councils and other support networks; 44 were created in Ruthin; and 24 in Rhyl. I would like that to be the other way round—my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas) would challenge me on that—because we need to create employment, not just throughout Wales, but in the poorest communities. That is where we must target our resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need the approach, which is proving successful in Wales, of developing specific sectors in specific geographical areas. In my area—the central part of north Wales—the sector is opto-electronics. Last week, the Chancellor announced a £400 million package to help research and development. A £10 million project for the St. Asaph business park, which lay empty for seven years under the Conservatives, has created 1,000 high-quality jobs. When the opto-electronics incubation and research centre is built this October, there should be 22 separate units around the centre from which new companies can be started, and they will be given all the help that they need over an 18-month to two-year period. Twenty-two new cutting-edge companies will be developed every two years in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry is that the jobs created in that sector may go to people in England, perhaps in Warwickshire and on the Wirral where there is a traditional skills base, because those skills do not exist in the central part of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
north Wales. In the past, the area has relied on agriculture, seaside and rural tourism, and coal mining. We know that the research centre is coming in October so we need to start to plan for the skills base to ensure that my area benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has taken measures in the past, as he did last week, to ensure that we connect with the poorest in the community, such as through the working families tax credit and the child tax credit. The child tax credit means that any family with a household income of less than £13,000 a year—there are hundreds, if not thousands, of such families in my constituency—will be given not £26 a week help, but £54 a week. That will make a big difference: it will make work pay. The minimum wage and the 10p starting rate for tax are policies that will affect individuals and encourage them to go back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has also taken steps to abolish stamp duty in certain areas, targeting the poorest communities in Wales. Such policies will help to get unemployment in my constituency down further. It is currently at 3.9 per cent. Only 1,115 workers in my constituency are unemployed at the moment, but 13,000 people in Denbighshire between the age of 16 and retirement age are economically inactive. Hopefully, those are the people that the Chancellor's measures will attract back into the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under objective 1, we need to get an extra 5,000 people in Denbighshire back into the work force, although only 2,000 people in the whole county are unemployed. That is a massive task. We need to get an extra 3,000 of the economically unemployed back into the work market. I think that that can be done. I praise Edith Frodsham of the Employment Service in my area of north Wales. Llandrillo college, the local further education college, opened just two years ago, and 5,000 students will be trained there. Gareth Evans of Denbighshire county council's economic development department has secured more objective 1 funding for Denbighshire than any other county in Wales—an average of £59 for every man, woman and child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Development Agency, the Federation of Small Businesses, Business Connect and the Confederation of British Industry are all playing a co-operative role throughout north Wales, and especially in my constituency, to ensure that we are getting unemployment down, employment up, and the profitability levels that we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a connection between the economy and the health measures that the Chancellor announced last week. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales mentioned that by 2007 and 2008 the health budget for Wales will stand at £5.8 billion. We need to ensure that the money is not just spent on health, but that it benefits the whole Welsh economy. We need to source Wales. I am not saying that we should favour Wales against any other sector of the United Kingdom or the European Union, because that is illegal. We need to ensure that companies in Wales are aware of the big benefits of putting in big and small contracts, and tendering for that £5.8 billion. A conference was held last October at the St. Asaph business park by the NHS in Wales to make north Walian firms aware of

the benefits. Only 25 companies from north Wales turned up. I was very disappointed about that. It was an excellent initiative. I ask all MPs in Wales to make the businesses in their constituencies aware of the benefits of putting in for contracts with the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase that the Chancellor announced in last week's historic Budget has put clear red water between us and the official Opposition. I am not sure whether hon. Members noticed, but I shouted a very uncomplimentary word when the Chancellor announced that the increase would happen over five years. It is okay for the official Opposition to pick holes in the Chancellor's policies. They might have the correct political strategy in not putting forward specifics three and a half years away from the election. However, as we get nearer and nearer to that date, Conservative Members will have to show their party and the electorate what their policies are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the current position of Wales. At the moment, Wales spends 9.1 per cent. of gross domestic product on the health service, which is above the European Union average. We have had great successes in Wales. In Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in my constituency, we have opened a £20 million cancer centre. It was opened by Prince Charles last year. We also have an excellent, well run hospital there. The finance has been put in place by the Chancellor; we now need to develop those policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear the phrase, "Welsh solutions to Welsh problems". There are specific problems in Wales. We certainly have the highest number of pensioners in north Wales. Clwyd, West, Conwy and my constituency have the highest number of pensioners in the whole of Wales. We need a co-operative and collaborative approach with social services and other sectors of local government so that the correct policies are implemented to stop pensioners falling ill and to ensure that they are looked after properly when they become ill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have to deal with the specific problem in Wales of the highest incidence—not just in the UK but in the whole of Europe—of teenage pregnancies and the related problem of the highest number of low birth weights. A researcher in my constituency told me that the incidence of low birth weights in Wales is worse than in Albania. Again, we need a co-operative and collaborative approach with education, housing and social services to address the problems. Another issue that we must deal with in Wales is long-term illness. As a result of depopulation and of heavy industries such as steel and coal, we have a legacy of long-term illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to develop specific Welsh solutions, but we must also ensure that we set targets and measure performance against them. If we do not do so—independently, as the Chancellor wants—we will not achieve our long-term health goals. That was one of the key points in the Chancellor's speech last week. I hope that my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, will take that message to the National Assembly for Wales when he has the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Welsh Grand Committee. I also thank the Secretary of State for Wales for his kind words about my predecessor, Sir Ray Powell, which were much appreciated. I will convey his and the Committee's thoughts to my constituents and to Sir Ray Powell's family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest tribute that I can pay to my predecessor is to try to increase Labour party membership in the constituency. During the by-election we had a significant increase of about 60 new members, so I thought that I would bring along some forms today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reading some of the statements of Opposition Members. After my maiden speech, the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr, who is not with us at the moment, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would support many aspects of the Labour tradition in Wales. I have always said that 1 feel like a prodigal son of the Labour party, which I am sure will disown me."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 February 2002; Vol. 380, c. 917.]</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] They will disown him, and I will tell him why. We heard hardly a kind word from him about the benefits that the Budget will bring for the people of Wales and the whole of the United Kingdom. He did not acknowledge the benefits to the health service—with adequate reform—to schools in Wales and to businesses. Unfortunately, I will have to tear up his membership slip. With that hon. Gentleman, I suspect that there is no silver lining without a cloud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said in June 2001:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We as a party will challenge that centre-right thinking of low taxation linked to low public spending … to reverse current thinking about low tax, low spend."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 June 2001; Vol. 370, c. 450.]</p></blockquote>
Am I missing something? I thought that that was what the Labour Government had delivered and were getting on with, along with reform, investment and change. Unfortunately, what do we hear from the hon. Gentleman? A little bit of whingeing. I will have to tear up that slip as well—no new membership there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I compliment the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. He wrote in 	<i>The Western Mail,</i> in response to the Budget, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the quality of people's lives in Wales may be about to improve … Welsh Liberal Democrats welcome the investment announced by Gordon Brown."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Send him a form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may well do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a lot this morning that was very complimentary about the Budget—rightly so. However, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has consistently pointed out that the idea originated with the Liberal Democrats. I believe that he agrees with that statement. What an amazing latter-day conversion to democratic socialism. We welcome him on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is the best new membership hopeful. Curiously, I find that I am in great agreement with him on one significant measure, so I will hold his membership form ready. He has stated categorically, time and time again, that investment must be accompanied by reform. We are in agreement; every hon. Member on this Bench says that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
we must have reform. The worst possible thing that we can do is to chuck money down a black hole. We want to deliver more nurses, more consultants, more teachers and so on. After the sitting, I will be waiting outside ready for the hon. Gentleman's signature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speed through my contribution, as other hon. Members wish to speak. Elin Jones, the Assembly Member and the shadow economic Minister, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"New Labour's Budget is offering nothing to help deprived areas. The majority of tax cuts and exemptions are for large companies which do not exist in Wales."</p></blockquote>
I could respond to that, and speak about the 1 per cent. tax cut for business and the 19,000 Welsh companies that will benefit because they will not pay corporation tax on taxable profits up to £10,000; I could talk about the 73,000 Welsh companies that will benefit from the streamlining of VAT; I could go on, but other hon. Members want to contribute to the debate. [HON. MEMBERS: "Go on."] No, I will not go on, because despite my welcome for the Budget, I also have some words of caution. There is a danger of over-promising, and of raising expectations, because delivery must go hand in hand with reform. There have been too many initiatives over the years. In the 1930s, there were streams of initiatives to regenerate the valleys; they have come and gone. They were not monitored effectively and there was no follow-through; we need such measures now and I hope that the Secretary of State will ensure that we get them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need greater investment in the electronic and tarmacadam infrastructure of Wales and the valleys to ensure that benefits are spread up into the hinterland as well as down the M4 corridor. Other hon. Members, too, will want the benefits to be spread throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest challenge that we face is a legacy of the many years when people in our constituencies were told, "Turn away from employment. You can't do it. You are not entrepreneurs; you do not have the vision. Forget it. Turn your backs on it." We are starting to wrestle with the challenge to change people's mindset and make the message clear. We want people to say, "Yes, we really can do this. The Government will put the framework in place for innovation; now let us get businesses, academics, entrepreneurs and everyone else together to turn our valleys and Wales around."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have information, which I shall be happy to pass to hon. Members, on innovative Welsh companies that show that in research and development, and in high-tech industries, Wales can deliver world-class companies. The picture is not as black as Opposition Members paint it; yes, there is a lot to do, but we are getting on with it. Opposition Members should support the initiatives rather than painting Wales blacker than black.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have had an interesting philosophical debate on the Budget statement over three days in the Chamber and in the Committee. The question is whether business has a fundamental role in the public services, and a civic duty. The answer must be yes.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
Opposition Members cry, "There is a wolf at the door. This is hammering private companies," but it is not a wolf—it is a measure for more nurses and more doctors. When the Opposition knock the investment being made and the partnership approach of business and the citizen, they knock the future of our health and public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the first speech to the Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore. I congratulate him on his election to the House and on his outstanding maiden speech in the St. David's day debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my comments to the implications for the national health service of this Budget, which will be seen as the one that sustained the NHS into the 21st century and reaffirmed the principle of a national health service funded from general taxation and free at the point of delivery. My constituents overwhelmingly believe in the basic principle of the national health service. They do not relish the prospect of taking out private health insurance, which creates a two-tier health system such as that in the United States, where insurance premiums are based on people's health status, where the old pay more to be insured than the young, where the sick pay more to be insured than the healthy and the chronically sick become virtually uninsurable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there are problems in the national health service. I am concerned about the long waiting times in my constituency, especially in the orthopaedic sector. Many of my constituents have been waiting for a considerable time for hip replacements and other orthopaedic operations. There have been concerns about repeated cancellations for operations and treatment, especially at the Royal Gwent hospital. There has been an over-reliance in Gwent on certain procedures at the University College hospital in Cardiff. There has also been great concern about the cancellation of procedures such as angiograms. I hope that there will be investment in the health service's capacity to undertake such procedures in hospitals such as the Royal Gwent and Nevill Hall. I have made several representations about the diminution of NHS dentistry in Abergavenny and Chepstow. I hope that the additional investment that the Assembly recently announced will remedy that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been recent successes. Capacity has increased. There is a new community hospital in Chepstow in my constituency, which is the first new hospital to be opened in Wales under the Government. There is a new day surgery unit at Nevill Hall hospital, where there are important plans to develop services. There are also exciting plans for a new health and social care facility in Monmouth, which will be the first of its kind in Wales. However, there is a need to ensure full value from the staff in the service. The Government are committed to investing in the training and education of doctors and nurses: in Wales, 500 more nurses and 400 more doctors are being trained than last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
However, we need greater value. My recent inquiries confirm that only 60 per cent. of the consultants in the Gwent Community Health NHS trust have full-time contracts. Some of them may practice privately within certain prescribed earnings limits. The remaining 40 per cent. do not work full-time for the health service. A major inquiry conducted by the Select Committee on Health found that the proportion was higher in England, and that there was a clear correlation between the most lucrative areas of private practice and the longest waiting lists. That situation must be rectified, and I hope that the Government will succeed in negotiating new consultant contracts. It cannot be right that when a significant number of doctors attain consultant status, they can decide what fraction of the week they wish to work for the national health service to maximise their earnings from private practice. That is not permitted in other public services. Neither senior police officers nor senior ranks of the Army can work for the police or the Army for part of the week, and for other organisations for the rest of the week. The capacity of the NHS could be increased if all consultants worked full-time for the NHS. They deserve to be rewarded for agreeing to have full-time contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our health service also depends on a vast army of nurses who are committed to serving patients but are constrained by the constrictions placed on them by the elitism engendered by the medical profession. When the Prime Minister launched the national plan for health in July 2000, he said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the role of nurses will be radically enlarged and old barriers to modern working removed. A qualified nurse has had at least three years training. It is wrong that, in many places, nurses are unable to make and to receive referrals, to admit and to discharge patients, to order tests, to run clinics and to prescribe drugs. Those old rules will be swept aside and nurses in every hospital will have that opportunity."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 July 2000; Vol. 354, c. 1257.]</p></blockquote>
The need for such reform is vital to end the demarcation between the medical and nursing professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the Government lost two years in establishing the national plan for health: it should have been instigated on the formation of the Labour Government in 1997. However, the Government's emphasis was on removing the internal market that the previous Government created, and removing the distinction between fundholding and non-fundholding GP practices. A health service that wants to advance must address the inequalities in health. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley quoted Professor Townsend, who was a member of the Black commission that reported on health inequalities; the previous Conservative Government swept that report aside without consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence shows significant health inequalities in Wales. I represent one of the more advantaged areas in terms of health and social status. The report of the Chief Medical Officer for Wales demonstrates that differences of as much as 50 per cent. exist between the better-off and the worst-off areas, particularly in the south Wales valleys. We need a health service that will invest in prevention. That report contains disturbing evidence about young people's lifestyles. At the age of 15, 20 per cent. of males and 29 per cent. of females
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
are smoking and 58 per cent. of males and 50 per cent. of females drinking alcohol. Whereas 50 per cent. of males take regular exercise, only 19 per cent. of females do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are important challenges. Wales has a high prevalence of coronary heart disease, hypertension and anxiety. Cancer rates are higher in Wales than in England and a higher proportion of people in Wales report limiting long-term illnesses than anywhere else in Britain. Improved health status is inextricably linked to attacking social exclusion. The Government have shown their commitment to that and to reducing health inequalities, but that must go hand in hand with the record investment that the Government are putting into the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We warmly welcome that because nothing is closer to the hearts of the people of Wales than the national health service. It was formulated in the south Wales valleys by Aneurin Bevan and it was his idealism and determination that enabled the greatest achievement of the 1945 Labour Government to come into being. Significantly, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, who is leaving the Room, could not give an alternative to the Government's proposals. We heard plenty of criticisms, moans, groans and whingeing—and were taken on an interesting grand tour of Europen countries, which I am sure Conservative Members have visited over the past few months—but no constructive alternatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales generally have welcomed the Budget and it has been particularly welcomed in my constituency of Caerphilly. It will take us a little closer to the new hospital for which the people of the area have argued for many years. At the moment, people in the Caerphilly constituency have to travel for their health needs to Merthyr Tydfil, the Royal Gwent hospital in Newport and the Heath hospital in Cardiff and it is high time that a state-of-the-art hospital was built inside the Caerphilly borough—preferably in my half of it. I also hope that the money allocated from the Treasury to Wales will be spent as effectively as possible. I hope that in-depth discussions will take place with the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that the money is effectively spent. I hope that we can debate that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), I believe that attention should also be given to tackling the fundamental causes of ill health in Wales. Prevention is far better than cure. If there is a single cause for the prevalence of ill health in many parts of Wales, it is the high incidence of poverty and the Townsend report clearly demonstrated that. If we are concerned about improving health and ending deprivation, we must focus on one policy above all others—ending long-term unemployment. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
Government have rightly pointed to their proud record of reducing unacceptably high levels of unemployment. Constituencies throughout Wales have seen dramatic falls in unemployment, despite the difficulties associated with manufacturing that we all acknowledge. However, pockets of high unemployment remain in many of our valleys communities. The further up the valleys we go, the more social problems we see, and the higher are the levels of unemployment. I welcome the Government's recognition of that and their acknowledgement that there is no room for complacency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to welcome specific measures proposed to tackle endemic social problems. I particularly welcome the increase in the minimum wage, which will help to make work more attractive. Lone parents are also encouraged into work. I also welcome the extension of new deal 25-plus and the extension of gateway to work to several pilot areas—four across the country and one in Swansea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend acknowledge that the same sort of hard-core and difficult long-term unemployment exists in parts of Cardiff—Ely in my constituency, for example? The Government have introduced a welcome pilot, the step-up programme, in an attempt to purchase jobs and get people back into work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly acknowledge that reality. The prevalence of long-term unemployment tends to be greater in the valleys, but that is not to deny pockets of high unemployment in other parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is important for its emphasis on enterprise. Wales is inherently an enterprising country. No one can tell me that entrepreneurship has never existed in Wales when we can point to the incredible figures that the labour movement has produced—people with the most radical and innovative ideas that this country has ever seen. I welcome the fact that the National Assembly has brought forward its own entrepreneurship action plan, an innovative strategy for encouraging the indigenous enterprise of the people of Wales. The objective 1 programme also emphasises the development of enterprise. We must recognise the need for a partnership between the National Assembly and the central Government in respect of the successful pursuit of various measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has rightly been acknowledged that small and medium-sized enterprises are vital. They are the backbone of the Welsh economy. It was once believed that full employment was achievable in Wales simply by attracting and relying on footloose investment from outside, but those days are behind us. We must rely on the capacity of our own people to generate wealth through small and medium-sized businesses. Budget measures such as the reduction in corporation tax and simplification of VAT make it more attractive for people to set up small businesses and create the wealth that we all need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is exciting. It has already secured the support of large swaths of the population. Indeed, a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
grudging political consensus is emerging that this Budget is a huge step forward. Its trenchant opponents are certainly politically marginalised, not just in Wales but throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by reflecting on recent events in France and the apparent success of Monsieur Le Pen. His modest advance in the first round of the presidential elections happened for many reasons, but no one can deny that he attracts some support from people who have experienced poverty, long-term unemployment and social exclusion, and who are looking for easy answers to complex problems. We must take note of what has happened in France and do everything possible to prevent fascists and people like them from gaining a foothold in Wales. One way of ensuring that that does not happen is to debate the contents of the Budget in full and ensure that they are implemented effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NHS has rightly grabbed all the headlines on the Budget. I will not therefore repeat the main points in the excellent contributions by my right hon. and hon. Friends, except to suggest that the reforms tied to that extra money have not been stressed enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives me pleasure to see Opposition Members being comprehensively wrong-footed by the Budget. In fact, so wrong-footed were the nationalists that the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr spent a great deal of time trying to denigrate the Budget, while neglecting to tell his constituents and other hon. Members that he voted for it in the Lobby last night. Although that support was welcome, it also suggests the worst case of schizophrenia among Opposition Members that we have seen for many years. On reflection, however, I think that their behaviour is probably symptomatic of the special brand of confusion and doublespeak that they bring to Welsh politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on the beneficial and positive effects that the Budget will have on Welsh business. In short, the Budget is very good for Welsh business and will prove to be a turning point for it. Indeed, the business sector's response to the Budget has been very encouraging. The package of reforms to reduce the corporation tax bills of more than 90 per cent. of tax-paying companies, and the cut in the starting rate of corporation tax from 10 per cent. to zero, mean that hundreds of companies throughout Wales will no longer pay corporation tax. The small companies rate was cute from 20 to 19 per cent., further reducing corporation tax bills for Welsh enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In delivering this Budget for business, the Government listened to business and trade unions by introducing a volume-based research and development tax credit—the fulfilment of an election pledge that will prove important to companies throughout Wales. There will also be £30 million of additional funding throughout the UK to help small firms to attain Investors in People status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced initiatives to reduce red tape for business, to such an extent that they make the Conservative Administration—not that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
there is anyone here to represent them—look like Soviet-style central planners. If we add to that all the encouragement that the Government are giving to enterprise and investment in deprived areas, we can see that Welsh business will benefit enormously from last week's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is taking place against a background of rising economic confidence in Wales. I was delighted to read in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Western Mail</i> a report about increasing optimism among Welsh manufacturers. In the words of Rudi Plaut, the chair of the CBI Wales economic trends panel,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rise in optimism is good news".</p></blockquote>
Another important and welcome announcement in the Budget was the radical reform of beer duty for the small brewing industry. The new progressive regime will throw a lifeline to struggling independent brewers and could have a major impact on a brew very close to my heart, Wrexham Lager.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did it have an effect on your stomach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not have an effect on my stomach, because it is not brewed in Wrexham now, so I do not drink it. I hope that, because of that move by the Chancellor, an entrepreneur will be able to see his or her way clear to stepping into the breach and ensuring the brand's survival back in Wrexham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative brings UK breweries in line with those in other EU member states, particularly those with strong brewing heritages like that of Wrexham. The UK scheme will be one of the best-targeted, simplest and most generous schemes anywhere in the EU. The 50 per cent. relief for small brewers—the maximum available under European Community law—shows the Government's commitment to the industry and to variety and choice, which was largely removed by the implementation by the Tory Government in the 1990s of the infamous beer orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One small cloud on the economic horizon causes great concern and anger in people in Wales and throughout the UK. The Government should act to remove that cloud, because it is leading to an unhelpful cynicism about business and enterprise. It is not in the economic interests of Wales or, indeed, the rest of the UK. I am referring to the recent series of huge pay awards, mostly made by themselves, to executive directors of British companies. Like other Welsh Members, I am incensed by the 130 per cent. pay rise recently awarded to Sir Brian Moffat of Corus. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will know that that undisguised greed in the Corus boardroom has caused deep anger in Wales. His pay rise was grotesque and demonstrates an almost perverse business logic that rewards failure—failure on a commercial and, worse, a social level with 3,000 steel jobs axed and all the attendant consequences for steel manufacturing areas. Will my right hon. Friend use his influence in the Government to ensure that this sort of fat-cat greed is checked and is not allowed to undermine the wider economy? We have increased fairness at the lower end of pay scales and it is time to increase fairness at the higher end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is important to stress how much importance Plaid Cymru attaches to the Budget for the UK economy. As long as we continue to have such a political entity within these islands, it is vital to address how the Budget addresses the UK as a whole and the role of Wales within it. Of course we voted in favour of the Budget. We would have liked to see it four or five years ago. If so, the present Budget might have been still more radical. Nevertheless, we would not vote this Budget down because it represents an important step forward for the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some elements are missing from the Budget, however, and it is right for the Opposition to criticise any shortcomings. We would have liked to see regional tax incentives targeted at objective 1 areas. Cuts in corporation tax and employer's national insurance contributions could have applied in such areas. We did not seek an overall increase in national insurance contributions, although we would have accepted release of the upper limit as a more progressive way to deal with people's contributions to national insurance and public services. We would have liked a penny on income tax and an increase to 50 per cent. top rate. We wanted less spent on nuclear armaments and I want to place it on the record that Plaid Cymru policy is to seek nuclear disarmament. We also oppose hidden subsidies to arms exports worth some £800 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard surprisingly little, and only tangentially, about the Barnett formula and the Barnett squeeze, which will affect public services in Wales and further distance us from the increase in England.

Carmarthen and Dinefwr demonstrated that regional inequality throughout the United Kingdom has grown under the present Government. That is why his hon. Friends and others in England are demanding a review of the Barnett formula—so that they can secure a better deal from central Government. Wales has nothing to lose from a review of the formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you sure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am positive and I shall return to the subject later if I have time.

The Budget took £8 billion in tax, but only £4 billion is being spent on public services. The reason for that was hidden in the Budget, but the Chancellor mentioned it twice—a further fiscal tightening. It is an important Budget for the national health service, but it has not substantially moved the Chancellor from the neo-liberalism that he has been following, under the Prime Minister, to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In national health service spending in Wales, the Barnett squeeze is coming into play, with a 6.8 per cent. increase in NHS spending in Wales, rather than the 7.4 per cent. increase that England would have. In Wales, we already spend the European average on health, which is what the Prime Minister said he wanted to happen throughout the United Kingdom. A key question for Wales is how to ensure that that extra money is not wasted in bureaucracy or a black hole and is spent on dealing with our health concerns in Wales, which relate not only to the health service but to our communities and the effect on them of bad housing, poor transport links and a bad quality of life in many of our towns and cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there are substantial benefits in managing the Government debt and that we must accept that the gratification of doing that is a few years ahead? In fairness to the Government, there is good fiscal control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman supports the Government on this occasion. Our Budget for the UK foresaw an extra £1.3 billion of borrowing. In fact, the Chancellor borrowed more than that, so perhaps we are with him in this case. However, we would have found other ways to obtain the extra money required. The Government are using only interest rates as a tool of economic slowdown and in relation to exchange rates and so on, when we should be considering cooling the consumer boom with taxes as well as interest rates. The Government have cut off their hands in dealing with such important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not for the moment. I have a lot to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr went to the heart of the matter when he said that the Government said throughout their first term and during the general election that no tax rises were needed to deal with the NHS. We were told in 1997 that we had 24 hours to save the NHS; now we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
are told that we have 10 years. In that time, all that we have seen is prevarication on the part of the Government on the real reforms needed in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) discussed some of those issues. However, what he discussed is devolved, so what the Budget does is up to the National Assembly for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not; I need to finish my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman obviously spends a lot of time hanging around toilets. He needs to answer a central question. How will PFI deal with his concerns and the difference he saw in a school and a hospital? Under PFI, team workers and cleaners are answerable to private contractors on long, 20 and 25-year contracts. We shall see in the health service conditions that are analogous to those on the railways, and we shall have less control over cleaning the toilets and the condition of our hospitals, not more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is too intelligent to miss my point completely. He chooses to miss it for party political reasons. He said that the matter to which I referred was devolved. In fact, it is not. The audit functions that we need to develop for the national health service require primary legislation. That is a matter for the House. It is not devolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, of course, and we look forward to the introduction of that primary legislation. However, primary legislation can devolve matters, too. It should not be a status quo. The condition of the toilets in the Royal Gwent hospital is a matter for the local authority, not the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members made a justified criticism of the disparity in costs and conditions of the national health service in Wales, but they failed to tell us how they would find the extra resources clearly needed for the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give away. I must make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leaders of the Conservative party have been going around Europe, looking at different models. What sort of models do they want to apply to this country? Is it the model of Greece, where nearly 4 per cent. of gross domestic product goes on health spending from private health insurance, and only 5 per cent. comes from the pockets of the Government? The Swedish model is good, because it is analogous to the one that we are developing. We have not heard from the Conservatives on how they would find the funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must be careful on the subject of the Liberal Democrats because the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire was nice to me in a speech recently. However, he has allowed the Liberal Democrats to take the claim for everything and the blame for nothing. The central issue that his party will have to address, particularly in next year's Assembly elections, is that it is in a coalition, so the state of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
NHS is down to it as much as any party in the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of families has been raised by several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Ynys Môn. The Budget paints a mixed picture for families. During last year's comprehensive spending review, the Government claimed to have raised 1.3 children from poverty. A couple of weeks ago, it came out that the true figure was only about half a million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way. I have only four minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system greatly depends on means-tested benefits. As a result of the Budget, I can claim tax credits for my children. I did not expect that; it is surprising that my family will benefit from a Budget that is supposed to address poverty. That is strange. As a result of that system, under new Labour the gap between the top and lowest incomes has grown. The top 10 per cent. of earners now receive 22 times what the bottom 10 per cent. do. That is not reasonable or acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has asked the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary some questions about what they have done in the past few months, and he has received some interesting replies. For example, the Under-Secretary has received 19 letters in the past nine months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-one—that is excellent news.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was 21 before; we just could not count them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were so many letters that he could not count them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary have been on a trade mission to the Czech Republic. We asked whether they had held any meetings with Consignia on the state of the post offices, but they had not. We asked how many press releases had been sent by the Wales Office, which has three full-time members of staff. There have been 20 press releases in two months, and four publications have been issued since 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how the Secretary of State and his Under-Secretary can be so under-employed, as I know that that is not what they want. They must be preparing a robust defence of the Barnett formula for submission to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry's investigation on the matter. I hope that in his reply, the Under-Secretary will give us a flavour of that submission, and will say why the formula is good for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interesting mention has been made of defence. Several hon. Members, including the hon. Members for Aberavon and for Caerphilly and my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, mentioned what happened in France. It would be remiss and disgraceful for any member of the Committee to make a connection between the open, civic nationalism of Wales and the narrow ethnic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
hatred of Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. To reinforce that point, I add that it is not our party—the best-known nationalist party in Wales, but not the only one—that has met Silvio Berlusconi and Gianfranco Fini of the Italian ex-fascist party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Mussolini?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mussolini's daughter is a member of the Italian Government—the same Government with whom the Prime Minister is prepared to meet and share discussions. That is the truth of the matter. Our party has not been praised by Jorge Haider for being at one with him against the "forces of conservatism". It was not our party that today described asylum seekers as "swamping" local schools. That was another party. It was not this party that met Le Pen's deputy, Bruno Gollnisch, for a seminar in October 1995 and took him for a drink in the Bar at the House of Commons. It was not this party, and I leave hon. Members to decipher which party it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us must unite against Le Pen and his ilk—against his brand of fascism, narrow nationalism and ethnic hate-ism. All of us must do that, and it will not help Wales or the Welsh language if any hon. Member seeks to make a connection between the hatred that we see in France and the open, welcoming and forward-thinking nationalism that we want to see in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have had a high quality and spirited debate. When we last met, I told the Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The value of this Committee is that it provides an opportunity for the 40 Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies to come together and to articulate our hopes, aspirations and desires for the people of Wales. This place is a vital part of the legislature and democracy, and long may that be so."—[	<i>Official Report, Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 28 November 2001; c. 74.]</p></blockquote>
Never can that have been more evident than today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, today we have shown the clear differences between the parties on the future of a great public service—the NHS. One party stands squarely behind the NHS and the values that it represents—this party, the Labour party in Wales. One party is determined to do all that it can to destroy the NHS—the Tory party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservatives say that there are better alternatives, but they will not say what they are—at least, not publicly. However, we heard the leaked words of their spokesman on health, when he told Tory doctors at their spring conference that the future of the health service was in "self pay". That is what they mean by changes in the health service. That is the real policy of the Tories. They believe in tradition all right—the tradition of the rich having first class health care and the rest of us having poor quality health care. That is what they stand for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are the nationalists. What can I say—10 out of 10 for whingeing, or nought out of 10 for any policy whatsoever? It is easy to complain about the health service and the other services run by the Assembly, but hon. Members in the Committee know, as I do, that our colleagues in the Assembly are making great strides in reforming public services in Wales. The nationalists have no policies whatsoever,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
except the little that we heard today about massive tax increases for the people of Wales. They have not yet learned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will, in due course. Be patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalists have not learned their lesson, but they will in the next election, when the people of Wales will take a decision based on the policies put forward by the parties in Wales. The only policies that they will support will be those of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask, in a different way, a question that I would have asked about the hon. Member for Ceredigion. Does my hon. Friend find it a surreal experience to hear Plaid Cymru putting forward a United Kingdom Budget rather than a Welsh Budget, in which it would have to show how it would provide high quality public services from the Welsh tax take? Plaid Cymru Members have never answered the question best put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Denzil Davies)—if their goal is self-government, how would they make up the difference between what we take in Wales and what we spend in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point powerfully. The nationalists lack credibility, both in Westminster and Wales. Plaid Cymru seems to have one clear policy—that of independence, full national status or a seat in the United Nations, whatever they want to call it. It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr say today, "While we remain in the United Kingdom". No doubt we shall soon have a timetable published by the nationalists for when they plan to take Wales out of the United Kingdom. That is what they have led us to believe today. The nationalist party—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Ceredigion says from a sedentary position, "The people of Wales won't let you."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru cannot welcome the Budget, because it would have to admit a key truth—that Wales benefits from being part of the UK and the fourth largest economy on the face of the planet. That is a shame for the Welsh nationalists, because while every day they attack England and English, they are happy to take the money in a Budget for the entire UK. They have no credible policies, as we shall see in the Assembly elections, when they will be swept aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fiscal and public expenditure matters remain the responsibility of the Government and Parliament. It is the Government, in the person of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who are responsible for presenting the Budget, and it is our responsibility as the House of Commons to scrutinise and vote on it. It has been the Committee's duty to scrutinise the Budget, and we have done that well, on both sides. I give that credit. We have done a good job, and I hope that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will pass
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
that on to one of his Assembly Members, who believes that we could be cut back to five Members to represent the whole of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution has put the Assembly in the driving seat on policy on key devolved matters. Devolution works best through partnership. No one is writing any blank cheques for the national health service in either England or Wales. We shall have to account for every penny. My colleagues in the Assembly want to ensure that they deliver good-quality services, and they want to work in partnership, as we are doing now, to reform the national health service in Wales. The Labour Members know that reform is necessary. Those who are opposed to reform are enemies, not friends, of the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's first step has been to build on the macro-economics, our economy, the Assembly on which we want to capitalise, and economic performance in Wales. The economic stability that our country now enjoys has been delivered by this Labour Government. Unemployment is falling, and the number of people in work has grown. Indeed, full employment is now within our grasp. The underlying strength of our economy has allowed us to invest in public services. The renewed confidence in Wales and her people is a direct result of the Government's policies. For too long, even at home, we have thought of ourselves as the sick part of the United Kingdom, both figuratively and literally. We have a mission. We must change that perception and ensure that people understand that Wales is not a failing country. If one listens to the nationalists, everything is bad. Wales has much to commend it, and we have a great opportunity. Working in partnership with our colleagues in the Assembly will ensure that the investment is put to good use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned that investment must be accompanied by reform, and nowhere is that more important than in the national health service. The NHS has not failed Wales, but it must meet the challenges that the people of Wales will put on it in this new century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS exists for the care and cure of patients. When we consider new practices and review existing practices in the health service, we must ask what they do for the patient. We must focus on patient needs. It is therefore vital to monitor the NHS and ensure that it meets the targets that we set, a point that was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central. As he reminded us, the Wanless report made it clear that we need an independent audit of the way in which the health service operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr, who speaks on behalf of the nationalist party, made it clear that he prefers income tax to fund public services. That is fine. I hope that he will explain that to the 565,000 Welsh pensioners who under his policy would pay more taxes to fund the health service. What about those who rely on their savings to produce an income? Increasing income tax would have hit them, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that the Budget contained nothing for manufacturing. My right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
Friend the Secretary of State referred earlier to the report in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Western Mail</i>. The steps taken by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will benefit companies in Wales. I saw the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr on television immediately after the Budget announcement, and he said that the increased spending would be swallowed up by inflation. God being ever-merciful, I am glad that he is not an economic adviser to Labour; he can stay with Plaid Cymru.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman criticised the use of PFI. My colleagues in the Assembly have made it clear that when it is appropriate to use PFI, they will do so, and when it is appropriate to use other sources for funding public capital expenditure, they will do that. It is clear from today's debate that he regards raising taxation as the way forward. We shall put that to the test when we go to the polls next spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman ended his speech by saying that Britain was now more divided than when the Government first came to power. The ironic thing about that is that his party wants to divide us more. It wants to tear Wales out of the United Kingdom. How much more divisive can one get?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central mentioned the problems in the national health service and how we must ensure that standards are driven up. Basic things such as cleaning are important, and we must take steps to ensure that improvements are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Ribble Valley does not take much notice of what the public say about the Budget, but 54 per cent. of his party's supporters believe that it was a good Budget, and 76 per cent., according to 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>—not a paper that is renowned for supporting the Labour cause—approve of the Budget. He complains about public spending, but week after week, and only today in Prime Minister's questions, we hear Conservative Members asking for more public expenditure. Yet when we put in more public expenditure, they complain about it. He mentioned inputs and outputs. I hope that when we introduce legislation to measure improvements in the health service, he will back us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon made some important points about the social solidarity that underpins the Budget and how it is intended to help us create a fairer and more just society. I hope that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire feels a little better than he did this morning. He made a thoughtful contribution on the Budget, but said that all the good things seemed to be Liberal Democrats' ideas. I now know the problem that my colleagues have in the bay, in Cardiff, in the Assembly. All the good things, the Liberal Democrats lay claim to; all the difficult things, they blame the Labour party for. The Liberal Democrat party faces two ways at the same time—something that it has done for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn spoke about the importance of funding the national health
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
service. He is right. He mentioned funding for schools. We must ensure that money goes to schools. He contrasted the way in which schools are funded in England and Wales. In Wales, the view is that money goes to schools via local authorities. We must be certain that all the money goes, unlike in the case of Plaid Cymru-run Caerphilly county borough council, which creamed off £1 million of the extra money given to schools in our area last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire spoke about taxes on business. The Government have a good record of cutting taxes for business, throughout the time that we have been in office. The hon. Gentleman said that initially he welcomed the aggregates tax, but when he met people opposed to it, he backed off. That is a typical Liberal Democrat approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) spoke with feeling against discrimination. She was right to speak as she did. It is right to link employment difficulties to helping the Welsh language. We do not want any more headlines such as "Town daubed with racist graffiti", which we saw in newspapers in north Wales. We will not help the language in that way. We will help the language only by ensuring that there are jobs and affordable housing in areas in which it is the first language—some key parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) welcomed the fall in the number of jobless people. In every Welsh constituency, unemployment has fallen since the Government came to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore. We almost did not make it; we were both locked in a lift a few minutes before 4 o'clock. He made an important and worthy speech, and we look forward to hearing more from him in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other comments were made by my hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth and for Caerphilly (Mr. David). I do not mind where it is based, whether in his half of the borough or mine, but let us make sure that we get a new hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's speeches have shown that the Budget makes an important contribution to Wales, the Welsh economy and the health service in Wales. Wales has a huge amount to gain from the Budget. It offers the possibility of revitalising our public services and achieving full employment, and ways of encouraging economic activity and moving people out of poverty and into work. It is based on the fact that we have a stable economy. I commend the Budget to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
