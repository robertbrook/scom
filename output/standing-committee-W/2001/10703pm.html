	<p>	<i>Motion made and Question proposed [this day]</i>,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech as it relates to Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Paul Murphy</i>.]</p></q></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been on my feet for a few minutes when you wisely and humanely released the Committee at 1 o'clock, Mr. Griffiths. I am conscious of the number of hon. Members who want to contribute to the debate so I shall wind up reasonably briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the history of Treasury niggardliness and mismanagement over the years. Although in most respects, things have greatly improved, there is a huge amount of ground to make up when considering the funding needs of public services. The Government have a much better ambition than their predecessor. Their achievements in respect of the health service are already substantial, notwithstanding the dismal litany of negativism from the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) this morning, or the grandstanding at the British Medical Association conference this week, where much of the rhetoric was extravagantly self-indulgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's commitments to the future are more impressive; I warmly congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on his part in securing highly positive funding settlements for Wales and in opening up major possibilities for us. With the settlements for the rest of the United Kingdom, that means future commitments in expenditure on education and health of 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, in real terms over a sustained period: a 10-year plan for the future of the health service. We are already beginning to see the benefits in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the announcement by Jane Hutt, the Minister for Health and Social Services in the Assembly, about additional funding for orthopaedic surgery, which has long been a notoriously inadequate aspect of the health service, especially in Gwent. Even beyond the Government's major funding commitment, more Money is likely to be needed if we are to satisfy the requirements of a decent society for a proper standard of public services. If we are to match the average levels of funding in counterpart countries in the European Union, let alone the standards of the best on the continent of Europe, we have a problem. Although the voters seem to set strict limits on what they are willing for the Government to raise in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
taxation, the European Union sets strict limits on what Governments may raise in borrowing because of the provisions of the Maastricht treaty and the stability pact. Where, then, is the Money to come from? If it is true that we will need funding beyond what is already planned, I see no alternative other than to mobilise private investors to make a further contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for the involvement of the private sector in the provision of public services is based not upon the superior qualities of management in the private sector—there is no inherent reason why public sector management should not be at least as effective as private sector management—but upon the overall need for a greater aggregate of funding. If we need to call upon private sector investment to make a large contribution, it presents us with a conundrum: how in the circumstances that we foresee and in the plans for reform envisaged by my right hon. Friends are public service values to be maintained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By public service values, I mean that public service is the determining criterion and that high-quality services are provided to the public when they are needed. In that context, profitability may have some part to play in the dynamics of provision, but it is emphatically a means, not an end. That is the key distinction between the provision of public services and the generality of activities in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, the commitment to public service values entails a commitment to decent terms and conditions for those individual human beings who play their part in the delivery of public services. I am glad that that point was made in the manifesto on which the Labour party fought the general election and has been reiterated by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health in the debate on the Queen's Speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We as parliamentarians must think carefully about the system of accountability if there is to be greater participation of the private sector. Some aspects of the future arrangements for accountability are already coming into focus: for example, the commitment that, in a relatively short time scale, 75 per cent, of health service funding should be mediated through general practitioners, who, as servants of the public in the front line, can reasonably be expected to have a strong commitment to ensuring that that Money is well used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who work in the health service should be accountable. They must be incentivised better than they are now to ensure that their activities truly are animated by the ethos of public service. However, partnerships must be developed. An example is the consultations in recent weeks between the Government and the trade unions. I hope that there will be many occasions at which, perhaps, Welsh lamb will be served at No. 10. Clearly, part of the apparatus of accountability will rest with regulators, independent inspectors and varieties of ombudsmen. The Prime Minister has insisted that high minimum standards will characterise the reforms that the Government are determined to bring in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular, nitty-gritty, arduous and unglamorous task that Members of Parliament and of the Assembly must carry out is to examine the precise terms of the contracts by which the private sector is engaged and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
exactly what the performance indicators require. That tough, technical work falls entirely within the tradition of Parliament's constitutional responsibility to grant or withhold supply, to scrutinise the way in which public funds are used and to hold the Government to account for such usage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech forecast that
	<br><q><p>"Legislation will be brought forward to help the police fight crime"</p></q>
Real progress has been made in the battle against serious crime. Crime has fallen by 16 per cent, in Wales since 1997, and I have nothing but respect for the part that Gwent constabulary, for example, has played in that. However, we must pay far greater attention and give far greater priority to low-level crime and antisocial behaviour, which afflicts far too many of our estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not name the estates in my constituency that are harassed and that suffer from such behaviour patterns because I do not wish to stigmatise them, but there is a real hopelessness in parts of my constituency. It derives from profound causes, such as de-industrialisation, unemployment, poverty, inadequate public services and the fact that my local authority, like others, does not have the power and the resources to do all that it wishes to do in support of our communities. We must take with the utmost seriousness the distress that is registered in our constituency surgeries by too many of our constituents, whose lives are made a recurrent misery by antisocial behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous Parliament, the Government brought in a panoply of measures to enable authorities to deal with such behaviour. I am dismayed that as yet not a single antisocial behaviour order has been issued in Newport. I am pleased that our new local authority chief executive and our new superintendent of police in Newport share my dismay and are determined that that should be a priority and that they should use all the available means. I am impressed by the audit that they are undertaking of the nature of the problem and of the variety of resources, including those of the voluntary sector and educational system, that are to hand in helping us to deal with the issues more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that, since his appointment, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has declared the topic a major concern. Decent people deserve better than to live under conditions of siege and in conditions of squalor. He spoke of
	<br><q><p>"Government and people working together to create a civilised society"—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 27 June 2001; Vol. 370, c. 654.]</p></q>
That seems to be the spirit that animates the Queen's Speech and that will animate the Labour Government's whole approach in its second term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate you, Mr. Griffiths, on your appointment as Chairman of the Committee. It is nice to see a Brecon boy in such a position and long may it continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech is high on choice and diversity, which I welcome. In achieving those aims, as well as higher standards, the cost will be great and many resources will have to be put in. My first job on being selected as a candidate was to go on television and tell people that the Liberal Democrats were against cutting fuel tax and for increasing income tax. I realised then that I would have to send tough messages; it was a good baptism. However, when we knocked on doors during the election campaign, our distinctive position on income tax was not completely dismissed by many people. Indeed, many had a high regard for the honesty with which we proposed our policies. There will be a cost to high standards in public service, which must be borne mostly by the taxpayer. It could be argued that the 2 per cent, increase in our total vote and the five seats gained overall did not completely vindicate our approach, but it demonstrated how many people thought during the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience in the constituency and during the campaign was that choice in public services is not increasing in the rural localities. Far from it, choice is decreasing for many of my constituents. Before we speak about increasing diversity and choice, we should make a fundamental effort to stop their reduction. I shall take a few examples from my constituency. The two primary schools in Trecastle and Libanus are under threat. Both communities have had their fair share of a bashing during recent times. Trecastle's confidence has taken a terrific hammering because of the misguided decision to undertake in the area a mass burial and burning of cattle infected with foot and mouth. Indeed, the local authority has already identified it as a place where there must be a huge regeneration effort. Closing the school is unthinkable and would send entirely the wrong message to the people who make that community their home and to those who want to visit and enjoy the locality. Unfortunately, Libanus has seen recent outbreaks of foot and mouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To lose those schools would take the very heart out of the community. It would also reduce choice. People who send their children to those schools are not necessarily country people as we would normally understand. They are from towns, and rightly believe that their children benefit educationally and socially from the ambiance of a small country school. Close those schools and that choice is lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are we to promote diversity in rural secondary schools? Many of my constituents' children already travel 15 miles to reach their secondary school. Shall we tell them that a secondary school a little farther on can meet their needs and desires, so that they spend most of the morning and evening travelling to school? In winter, those children, some of whom are only 11, often leave and reach home in the dark. We should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
have been ensuring greater quality, diversity and choice in schools, so let us make a bigger effort to do so, particularly in rural areas, rather than designate schools as having particular specialties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a real problem in the area with identifying a site for Welsh-medium education at secondary level. Wherever it is sited, it will be inconvenient for one community or another. At present, we have decided to go along the route of providing Welsh language units in secondary schools. I know that that is unacceptable to a number of families, but let us work hard to make it work as well as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech states that the Government will
	<br><q><p>"give patients greater influence on the running of the NHS"</p></q>
However, that is not happening in Brecon, where there has been a determined effort to close the GP-led maternity unit, which has been an excellent service. The GPs who already work in the area and have skills and expertise in anaesthesia, surgery and obstetrics are willing and anxious to continue providing that service. That is what the patients, mothers and mothers-to-be want too, but there seems to be a plot—I would not say conspiracy—to ensure that that GP-led service is not reopened. The net effect is that mothers-to-be who, it is judged, may have a medium-risk delivery now have to go to Abergavenny, although many would prefer to stay in Brecon. Their choice has been reduced at a time when the Government say that they will increase choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very happy that our community hospitals are open and we intend to ensure that they remain so, but because of the great debts that hang over the area health authorities, almost by stealth some beds and services are being lost. The trust notified us of severe job losses at Brecon hospital and although it has agreed to reconsider that, we are still concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, people have been going to surgeries and saying that non-medical respite care at Brecon hospital has been stopped, but there has been no announcement. When people turn up for such care, they are simply turned away and told that either social services or facilities five or 10 miles away will provide it. For many people, that is no choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked to the people of Knighton, who had not had NHS dental care for more than a year because their dentist was ill and no other NHS dentist was prepared to work there. Many people, including single mothers, could not afford to pay for private care, but could not get public transport to take them to a NHS dentist who was prepared to treat them. There is not much choice for those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, because of poverty in rural and urban areas, the problem with NHS dental provision is serious throughout Wales? The alternative to NHS care in such circumstances is no care at all, which will ultimately cost society much more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments; I agree that there is no choice for such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
Then there is the case of the 5.30 bus in Sennybridge—the Lord Lucan of the transport system. It disappeared without any warning one day and it has not been seen since, although there have been some unconfirmed sightings. That is typical, really. Bus services are reducing in our area, particularly in the Sennybridge, Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil triangle and down the Swansea valley. Although, out of necessity, my constituency has some of the highest car ownership figures, many of my constituents are still without cars and depend on public transport, which is increasingly infrequent and inconvenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech sadly lacked anything on agriculture and rural affairs. The problems of agriculture have been well documented. I should like to mention one that keeps surfacing, whose true effect I do not believe is yet known. Imports of meat and meat products are becoming less and less regulated. There are fewer people at the ports to inspect the meat as it comes into the country, and fewer and fewer customs officers. We face the prospect of German beef—meat from the European Union—containing spinal cord material entering the country. We have put great emphasis on ensuring that all our meat is up to standard and yet our partners in the Community can export to us without the complete assurance that their meat is safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so for countries in the EU, how much more is it the case for third world countries? I have grave reservations about the quality of meat from such countries. They have inferior hygiene systems and less well developed welfare standards in the production of animal products. They can therefore undercut our farmers in the economics of production. Worse, such production jeopardises the health of our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of economics, what has the foot and mouth outbreak cost us? I trust that we will have a completely open and public inquiry into the causes of the outbreak and its handling. If it turns out that foot and mouth was introduced into this country by a meat import, how much would this country and our consumers have saved from such imports? The cost to this country will have been huge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech advocates the production of energy from renewable sources. The experience in my constituency—I am sure that other hon. Members have had similar experiences—is that large-scale operations are often unacceptable to local people. However, there are acceptable ways which galvanise communities into working together. I am talking about community-sized operations, whether they be wood-burning energy production or hydro-electric schemes. We have the opportunity to promote that type of development in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way on the subject of energy provision. Does he share my delight at this afternoon's announcement from the European Parliament to give special dispensation to Aberthaw power station to continue the vital production of energy for south Wales for at least the next few decades? That decision will be welcomed by everyone

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
in this Room. I am glad that those few politicians in Wales who were stupid enough to try to insist that the regulations were framed so tightly that Aberthaw might have to be closed have lost the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In principle, I am sure that continuing production is a good idea. I am sure that it is important for the hon. Gentleman. As I understand it, it will ensure the continued use of Welsh coal from the Tower colliery. A project such as an energy-promoting scheme can be useful for bringing communities together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech has a lot of good in it, but could people ever doubt that investing more heavily in education to reduce class sizes in primary schools would improve education? For a long time it was argued that the quality of teaching rather than the number of children in a class was what mattered. I am pleased to see class sizes falling. For schools in my constituency—until recently I was a school governor—that is most welcome. I would like ever-greater strides to be taken in that respect. The Liberal Democrats are committed to ensuring that resources are sufficient for that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hywel Francis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Griffiths, for catching my eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Gracious Speech because it places due emphasis on both enterprise and social inclusion, both of which are so important for building a more socially just and tolerant society in Wales. The greatest challenge to Wales today is the scourge of social and economic deprivation. The Gracious Speech built on the considerable progress made in tackling the problem by the Labour Government and the Labour-led Assembly in recent years, particularly regarding public service investment, pensions, job creation, the rights of disabled people and their carers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tackling deprivation we must remember that, according to the multiple deprivation index in Wales produced by the National Assembly last summer, three quarters of the most deprived communities in the top 100 most deprived communities in Wales are in or near the former coalfields of north and south Wales. Six of those deprived communities—Gwynfi, Glycorrwg, Cymer, Briton Ferry West, Sandfills east and Sandfills west—are in my constituency. Deprivation exists elsewhere, of course; I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) speak about it earlier. However, as I shall illustrate more fully in a moment, the scale and density of deprivation in the former coalfields is of a different order. I acknowledge that other areas—such as Ynys Môn, which has five mainly rural wards— feature prominently in the top 10 worst areas of deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable progress has been made since 1997 in tackling poverty both in my constituency and throughout Wales. On the four key measures of deprivation—joblessness, low incomes, health and education—significant progress has occurred in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
Aberavon. Mainly as a result of the new deal, it has seen a reduction in youth unemployment of more than 60 per cent. Many people on low incomes have benefited from the national minimum wage. After a delay of nearly 18 years, local people now have the new Baglan hospital to serve them. Perhaps the most striking impact of investment in education has been the progress of two comprehensive schools, Cymer Afan and Sandfields. Last year, they were the two most improved comprehensive schools in the whole of Wales. If ever there were testimony to the value of public investment in education, it would be such progress in the most deprived areas of my constituency.

We have also benefited from the Labour-led National Assembly's wonderful Community First initiative and objective 1 status. More, however, needs to be done for the valley communities, particularly in advocacy, capacity building and the sort of partnership that we have already witnessed between Westminster and Cardiff. The Coalfield Communities Campaign has called for a coalfields taskforce for Wales. To build on that we need a manifesto for the valleys which emphasises quality of life and social justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Gracious Speech provides a platform for a socialist advance for the valleys and similar communities throughout Wales. I therefore wholeheartedly welcome and endorse it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Meironnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) forgot to welcome you formally, but he had a word with me during our break for lunch to ensure that I acknowledge the change in the chairmanship of our Committee. I do not pretend, even after a year in the House, to know how such things are done, but I am sure that the position is well deserved. You bring much experience to the post, and I look forward to many more meetings of the Welsh Grand Committee—a few of them even in Wales. I make an immediate pitch, of course, for Aberyron as the best possible setting. I think that hon. Members secretly enjoy going to west Wales because it does not give them time to get back. The day has to be dedicated to the tourist delights of Aberyron.

This is a good time to debate some of the issues that arose at the general election. The Secretary of State talked about the message that the Labour party took to the doorsteps of Wales. My party took a strong message to the people, as I am sure did all the parties— although the message of the Conservative party was somewhat mixed in that it was delivered by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), whose qualities in the House are evident but who does not immediately appeal to the people of Wales, or indeed to those on the Conservative Benches, as a Welsh Member of Parliament. That is a difficulty for him, but there we are.

We must all acknowledge that we met disillusionment on the doorsteps. The media like to call it apathy, but it was not. I found people who were not apathetic but angry, concerned and disillusioned. They wanted to change things but simply did not know how to do so. My job is to try to persuade such disillusioned people to vote for me in order to do that on their behalf, and I am glad that I had a certain amount of success in doing so. However, the overall vote in Wales went down once again, this time by about 12 per cent. That is a shocking decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Secretary of State's opening remarks about the need for a wider debate, across all the parties, on how we can again involve people in politics. The forum of the Welsh Grand Committee could be used to demonstrate that, although the major financial and tax decisions are made in Westminster, it is still relevant for Welsh Members to act as a body for the interests of Wales. I commend to the Secretary of State a report of the previous Public Administration Committee, which talked about public participation, in the wider sense, in social life throughout the United Kingdom. There is much in that report that hon. Members should advocate. I declare a small interest because in the job that I had before I was elected as a Member of Parliament we engaged communities in rural areas in decision making. That is a key issue.

One receives many items through the post. As they go on the way to the big recycling sacks, one occasionally catches a glimpse of them; a headline, for example, will catch one's eye. A headline about Quebec caught my eye today. We all know the fascinating discussion in Quebec on the constitution from time to time. The headline stated that voter turnout in Quebec is consistently among the highest in the world and has always been above 75 per cent. In referendums, it often reaches between 82 and 93 per cent. That raises the question of how we engage the Welsh public in a debate on the future of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is why I found disillusionment over the state of public services on the doorsteps. The hon. Gentleman's party has failed the voters of Wales, and failed to be honest with them about its intentions. That is a lesson that he and his party will have to learn. I did

not find any disillusionment in Wales about my party. In the context of a declining voter turnout, the only party in Wales to increase its vote by 40,000 and to get its best ever general election result was my party—the party of Wales. So I do not think that there is any confusion among voters about where we stand or where we want to take Wales in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Griffiths, for steering us back to the path. I would be delighted to debate the matter much further. However, there should have been something in the Queen's Speech about how to get more people involved in politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mindful of your strictures, Mr. Griffiths, let us examine what was not in the Queen's Speech. I must echo the remarks of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, following the trend that I began with his predecessor, which I am sure I will continue. It was disappointing that there was not more help for agriculture, particularly tourism, which is feeling the effects of the foot and mouth crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is especially difficult to understand why a full public inquiry into foot and mouth has not been announced. We need that; no one will lose by it. It is ignominious to have this debate, like that over BSE, with one side blaming the other. The fact is that the outbreak was a crisis in agriculture. We do not know where it came from, and we are not convinced about how it was handled. There were reports in yesterday's press that its impact could have been halved by a different approach from the chief veterinary officer. We need a public inquiry to be able to be sure about where that approach was taking us, and I hope that we get it. I am disappointed that we have to bang on about it all the time; we should not need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech indicated a significant change with regard to public services, and a significant enhancement of the role of the private sector in delivering public services in Wales. It is worthwhile for us to debate that, because the Secretary of State said that there was nothing fundamentally wrong about involving the private sector in that way. I do not disagree with him; I have never advocated using direct labour organisations to build hospitals, for example. There is nothing wrong with the private sector in that context. The question is how we use the private sector, how we pay for its services and how we ensure that the efficiency of the public sector does not become a sort of Railtrack, changing the parameters of the services themselves? Privatisation has taught us the lesson that we should ask such questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
The right hon. Member for Newport, East (Mr. Howarth) made the point that the private sector is not necessarily more efficient or better at running services than the public sector. I agree with him. If we look at the United States, we find that privately managed hospitals spend 34 per cent, of their costs on administration, compared with 12 per cent, in the national health service. In Australia—whose experience is more like ours—the private sector, which has been brought into public sector hospitals, throws up its hands and leaves certain operations or treatments as soon as it sees that it cannot make Money from them. It has all sorts of ways of retreating. It can turn into another company, it can go bankrupt, it can do all sorts of things to get out of its contract. The public sector never does that. It is always there to deliver public services free at the point of need. That is a clear principle that we should bear in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must think about what the private sector will get out of this relationship with the public sector. The answer is profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but the question is whether excessive profit can be made from investment in the public sector. How much public sector Money is going into a particular project, and how much does that create by way of profit motive for the private sector? We must ask every time whether it would not be cheaper and better in the public sector. We have already had a debate on the private finance initiative. Such a mechanism could take us forward, but the reason for its use is more to do with public sector borrowing and debt requirements and the way that the Government want to run the economy as a whole than with any real benefits to the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary mentioned Penweddig school in my constituency, and very welcome it is too. However, at local level, we face an invidious choice: a new school or hospital via PFI or nothing at all. That means that we shall say, "Yes, thank you. We will have that", but what will happen in 20, 25 or 30 years' time? I am concerned to ensure that if contracts are let, they are flexible enough to allow the public sector to dictate what happens in the buildings that result. Given what has happened in the health service in the past 30 years—how treatment that formerly took weeks or Months now takes only a day or two—it would be remiss of us to draw up binding contracts that do not allow the public services to be flexible in responding to new needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also bear in mind that private sector health care is under-regulated and under-controlled; we do not have the facts and figures on it as we do for public sector health care. One of the few figures that I have been able to obtain concerns admissions. Last year, there were 142,000 admissions to NHS hospitals from private sector hospitals. Treatment that started as private had to end up, in 142,000 cases, in the NHS, being paid for by the taxpayer. Everyone has a right to free care, but these people started off in private care and, presumably because of some sort of deficiency, had to be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some operations now take place in private hospitals, and that there is a greater need for certain operations that the private sector is able to carry out? Therefore, there is a dual use for private hospitals. We have moved a long way since the 1960s. I remember growing up in Swansea when private hospitals and medicine were mercilessly attacked. Cannot we simply accept that private medical care has a role—one that this Government actually use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept the hon. Gentleman's first point, which is that private hospitals are now used to plug a gap in public health care provision. For as long as private sector hospitals need to be used in that way, I support that. My party's key principle on the issue is not necessarily one of ideology, but of honest cost-benefit analysis. We must not go for the cheap option today knowing that it will be expensive over 20 or 30 years. We need to have that principle in mind in our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another issue that was brought up in the general election, the long-term care of the elderly. It was not totally reflected in the Queen's Speech, although perhaps it should have been. It affects my constituency greatly, as my constituency vies with that of the hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) as having the highest number of long-term elderly in need of care, mainly because of people who retire to an attractive coastal area. That obviously puts certain pressure on local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth bearing in mind that we did not have a proper debate in the gneral election about taxation, including, as my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, the use of a higher rate of taxation to plug some funding gaps. We have not had that discussion in the debate on the Queen's Speech either, and it is strange that it appears to be emerging in the election for the leadership of the party that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley represents. At the general election we advocated use of a higher rate of taxation to pay for long-term care of the elderly. In Wales, the cost of personal and nursing care is about £50 million a year. That is a lot of Money, but it is a reasonable sum if it allows our elderly to have a reasonable quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it happens, that figure is the same as the health underspend in Wales this year. The underspend will not necessarily be long-term underspent, and could be used for other purposes, but there is something to be said for changing the Assembly's ability to meet the cost of long-term care of the elderly, as the Scottish Parliament has been able to. Of course, the powers are not all there now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some education issues will pass us in Wales by. As hon. Members have said, we have no clear need for different sorts of specialist schools. We have Welsh language schools and Church schools, so we already have a diverse educational system in Wales, all predicated on the comprehensive system. My party and I want that kept in future, and we want it to be preserved by the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
I hope that the Bill mentioned by the Secretary of State will be as permissive as possible in Wales, because I share some of the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy regarding sponsorship in schools. I would not like to see school meals sponsored by Mars, as that would not be educationally or nutritionally advisable. I do not want to see educational packs sponsored by commercial companies that have something to gain by targeting a market of young people and children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider taking action on television advertising aimed at children, bearing in mind the fact that Scandinavian countries do not allow advertising to be targeted at children during some hours of the day. Certainly, we should not enhance the way in which our children are exposed to such strong commercial pressures. We must remember that they then put pressure back on parents in turn. I declare an interest here, as one who sometimes has to resist those pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to make a broader comment on the increasing emphasis on faith schools. Although the point may not have so much importance for Wales, we must wait and see what happens. I have some concerns about the functions of such schools generally, because I believe that unfortunately, both for Christian and for Muslim students, they are being used as a method of segregation in large conurbations. Parental choice there means de facto segregation, which is a route that we do not want to take in this country. I do not know how we can preserve genuine choices of faith schools and at the same time preserve genuine mixed communities, which the Government—and I—see as central to strong local communities. A difficult task faces us, but one thing is certain: we should have a debate before the Government goes headlong into encouraging the development of such schools. I do not think that there would be much of a case for such development in Wales, but I am talking about the United Kingdom as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a few words about higher and further education in Wales, which has been heavily affected in recent years. Many Members attended a lobby by the University and College Lecturers' Union—NATFHE—in which that sector made clear its difficulty in keeping up with the education sector as a whole. The pay of some of those people has fallen behind that of sixth-form teachers, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of the Committee and of the Secretary of State to the question that I asked him earlier today about the Rees report. I accept that he has considered the recommendations, and I genuinely hope that he will read parts of the report, because it contains a real message. It is an independent report commissioned by the National Assembly. It recognises that tuition fees are a barrier to obtaining education for some, but says that the real barrier is related to maintenance grants, and attracting students from poorer backgrounds to university and sustaining them there. That is an issue for the United Kingdom Government, not the National Assembly. The Assembly may ignore my advice, but if it does it will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
taking Money from Paul to pay Rhodri, as it were. How higher education for students will be funded is a decision for the United Kingdom Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will use the Rees report in debates in Cabinet and in his own party to advocate at least some return to means-tested maintenance grants. Access funds are supposed to be a safeguard against maintenance grant failure, but they are actually a misnomer, because they do not give anyone access to education. They kick in only when a student is fully indebted with a full student loan, so we do not have the safeguard that the Government and others would like to tell us that we have. There are two universities in my constituency, and I have seen a detrimental effect on the local economy from declining student numbers and from the decline in the student economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the issues that I would have liked to see addressed in the Queen's Speech, on which there is a continuing debate. However, I take the opportunity to welcome what the Secretary of State said in the middle of his speech about a better understanding or relationship with the National Assembly, and about permitting it do as much as possible within the ambit of Bills. That is a key interim phase before a proper Parliament for Wales is established, and it is what I and many other Members would like to come about— a proper Parliament that can deal with the things that I have criticised the Queen's Speech for leaving out, such as long-term care, tuition fees, student fees and health reform in Wales. We need a Parliament with the full ability to legislate in all the areas currently devolved, and others, such as police authorities, which should perhaps have been devolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, all we have had from the Government is "all gong and no dinner"—to use a phase that a constituent of mine used in a public meeting. In other words, the sound and the fury have been there but the delivery has been missing. The Government have been elected to deliver, and I hope that they will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Queen's Speech and the measures therein, particularly the priorities given to education, health, crime and welfare reform. I also welcome the maintained commitment of the Government to devolution in Wales, and I do that as somebody who has supported devolution for over two decades. I want to see that work, and it is the duty of all members of the Committee to ensure that devolution works for Wales. That is why I was encouraged when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State talked about the importance of a working partnership between the Grand Committee, the Westminster Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. At the general election, the people of Wales gave the Government a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
mandate to deliver on public services, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) said. That is the task ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In giving that mandate, the electorate also rejected the policies of the Opposition, particularly their economic and fiscal policies. To deliver the investment that is needed in public services, it is essential to have economic stability, and that is what the people of Wales want. Macro-economic policies are fundamental to reform, which leads to a more prosperous society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased by the mention of education reform in the Queen's Speech because diversity is important— hon. Members have discussed the diversity in each of our constituencies, and that should be maintained. While education is a devolved matter, we, as Members of the first full Parliament since the National Assembly for Wales was set up, have a positive role to play in our constituencies to ensure that standards are maintained and, indeed, improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education, education, education was the mantra of the Prime Minister before we were elected to our first term and that must be followed by jobs, jobs, jobs. Areas such as my own need real remedies, not just rhetoric. During the past two decades, there has been under-investment and a period of so-called boom and bust. On Ynys Môn we had a lot of bust, but not much boom. It is time that that changed, and that is why I welcome the Secretary of State's comments that objective 1 and initiatives such as Community First are vital, and we must work with the National Assembly to ensure that there is economic growth across Wales: from Caerdydd to Caergybi, from Cardiff to Holyhead and from Penmon to Pembroke. We need even development to do that and we must have a fully integrated transport system. We must use all modes of transport—road, rail, sea and air—to spread wealth across Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency of Ynys Môn is predominantly rural, but I get fed up when people say that there was nothing for rural communities in the Budgets since 1997 and the Queen's Speech. It is also nonsense to say that recent measures have been just for middle England. I do not speak about rural and urban communities, but about a united community that is both rural and urban. People in the rural parts of my united community benefit from greater involvement in the running of their health service, from legislation to help the police to fight crime, from welfare reforms, and from measures to help people back to work. We must not forget that that helps rural and urban communities. We can move forward to a more prosperous, equal and inclusive Welsh society only with a radical outlook to reform our public services that is combined with sound public finances. I know that that is a society to which we all aspire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a concern about low turnout, although that was not in the Queen's Speech. We must start to engage with young people especially, and get them interested in the democratic process. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that people whom he met on the stump were not interested, and were not doing cartwheels about our record on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
schools and health. That may be the case. However, the people were also rejecting uncosted and unreal policies put forward by the Opposition. What is for sure is that they were not interested in more powers for the National Assembly for Wales. The people whom I encountered were not interested in national status, which I believe is just code for independence. The new pact may underpin their views on the matter. The hon. Member for Ceredigion refused to mention the word independence. However, it is a word that the Scottish National party happily used in its manifesto before the general election, and the pact may recover that in good time. However, I tell the hon. Member for Ribble Valley that my constituents also rejected the "just save the pound" Tory mantra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because Labour Members engaged with the people of Wales over the election period and the past four years, with the result that the Queen's Speech includes the real issues of health, education, crime and welfare, that we have 34 out of 40 Members on the Government Benches. That is why I am part of that winning team. That is why Mon Mam Cymru, the mother of Wales, is back in the political mainstream.

I am delighted to be here at the Welsh Grand Committee after our little hiccup last week. We are now back to full strength, but I am sad that no Conservative represents a Welsh seat. Our vote increased as a percentage at the election to 21 per cent. It would have been right if at least some of those votes could have translated into representation at Westminster but we accept the verdict of the electorate. We are still the second party of Wales, clearly beating Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
that his constituents do not wish to save the pound, but I suspect that they do, but think that they will have an opportunity at a referendum to do just that and so were able to put that issue to one side. Those issues of education, health, crime and welfare are important to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first measures mentioned is a Bill to reform education and
	<br><q><p>"to promote diversity and higher standards, particularly in secondary schools."</p></q>
Perhaps the Minister can tell us exactly what impact that will have on Welsh education. It is a devolved area but I assume that whole chunks of this legislation will have Welsh content. It will be interesting, in the light of what Her Majesty said later about the Government continuing to further the cause of devolution, to learn exactly what that Bill will do and what consultation will take place on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend to introduce legislation to reform the health services. There is a separate Bill for Wales; as the Speech states:
	<br><q><p>"Legislation will be drafted to reform the provision of health services in Wales."</p></q>
However, I assume that the other Bill will have Welsh import too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First among the matters that I should like to talk about is the campaign by the 	<i>South Wales Argus</i> to protect hospital staff. Yesterday's edition talked about the abuse that national health service workers have to put up with almost daily. Under the headline "Nurses Suffer Abuse", it said:
	<br><q><p>"Gwent frontline hospital staff had to deal with a load of abuse in the last few days. The incidents occurred at Nevill Hall Hospital, Abergavenny"</p></q>
The article gives weight to its campaign for a system, similar to the one already announced in other areas, of giving a red card to people who abuse NHS staff. We all appreciate the dedication of those who work in the NHS. They do not do it for the Money and must have a greater calling, but they should not have to put up with abuse from those who receive care from them. I hope that, in at least one piece of legislation, we can introduce measures that ensure that staff in NHS hospitals throughout Wales will be properly protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also respond to the announcement made today by Dr. John Chisholm at the British Medical Association conference? He is chairman of the committee that deals with general practitioners, who say that they have had enough. That follows a recent call from GPs, which said that, unless they see some changes, a number will simply leave the NHS. We cannot allow that. GPs are asking for more resources so that they can spend more quality time with their patients and provide better services. Better care was mentioned directly in the Queen's Speech, so how will the Government put into action the words that they have come up with? They can hear what those in the frontline services are saying, but it is pointless saying that the Government will deliver when they have not done so after four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not in Committee to hear what was probably an excellent speech by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), but he was right to say that the Government have failed to deliver
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
in the past four years. The Labour party share of the vote was down by 6 per cent, at the election, and it was the only major party in Wales to reduce its percentage share of vote. My sadness is that we were not able to attract those non-voters in sufficient numbers to our party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about a crisis of democracy and the drop in turnout, and some of the decline in the number of people who feel it worth while to get out and vote has a direct correlation with those who feel that we have nothing to offer. They believe that we talk about aspiration but do not turn that into direct action. This is the Government's second chance to deliver on those frontline services. I hope that, with the full knowledge that the waiting list for the waiting list in Wales is increasing, the Government will listen carefully to the people of Wales and those in the NHS, and deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak about other issues briefly. One is foot and mouth and, as has been said, it was sad to hear about the recent outbreak in Brecon. Tourism and farming have both been hit hard. Although the matter is devolved, the Government, with their new Department, are examining it and how to deliver. We must work together at all levels of government to ensure that those involved in farming and tourism get the support that they desperately need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the Dun and Bradstreet report, which the Secretary of State mentioned. It said that five Welsh businesses were collapsing each day and referred to foot and mouth. We should not dismiss it by saying that there are other areas in which we are doing rather well; we must instead pay due regard to businesses, particularly the one-man or two-men bands that have been working over many years. We should work out how we can provide recovery packages to such businesses so that, having survived, they can grow and create the fresh jobs that we need in Wales, especially in rural areas. Rural Wales needs jobs desperately. We cannot ignore the plight of those involved in tourism and agriculture who have been blighted by foot and mouth, and simply believe that the situation will be picked up by other industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crime is mentioned in the Gracious Speech, but we will examine again the Government's proposals for delivery. Figures show that violent crime is on the increase. In Wales between March 1998 and September 2000, violent crimes against the person went up from 17,589 to 38,185—an amazing increase—while robbery went up from 786 to 885. Obviously, the police must be given better support. Perhaps we should consider the specials, who play a valuable role by assisting the police in key areas and releasing them to perform other duties. We should encourage young people to join the specials. Indeed, that would contribute to active citizenship, something that the Government wish to promote. If more youngsters throughout the whole of Wales were involved in the specials, they would be performing a doubly valuable service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
We were told that there would be something in the Queen's Speech about victims' rights, but I fail to see it. Perhaps the Government would reconsider victims' rights—and also sentencing, which is important, too. A lot of emphasis has been placed on the early release of prisoners. How about giving some support to the police who have tracked down those people by ensuring that persistent offenders are detained in prison for longer periods of time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education has been mentioned, and we want to ensure that our schools receive proper support. There is a problem with attracting people to teaching. 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> found that there were 10,000 vacancies in secondary schools throughout the whole of the country, and a survey carried out by the National Association of Head Teachers found that there were 4,000 vacancies. Secondary class sizes have actually increased. The Government said that they would reduce class sizes in certain areas. If they believe that it is important to reduce class sizes, it is time that they looked at the whole of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On encouraging enterprise, we have heard that many small businesses are unhappy about bank charges. The excellent report by the Federation of Small Businesses entitled "Barriers to Growth and Survival", which came out last year, has been referred to. The percentage of businesses in Wales that are dissatisfied with the interest rate for borrowers— I speak with some authority—is 58 per cent., and a higher percentage, 73 per cent., are unhappy with bank charges. That is an accurate reflection. However, when we flip the page—perhaps this will be of interest to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams), who referred to it earlier—we discover that the percentage of businesses that are unhappy with fuel costs is 95 per cent. I want to know what the other 5 per cent, are doing; I suspect that they have bicycles. The percentage of businesses that are unhappy with road tax is 77 per cent. The percentages unhappy about legislation issues are: for volume of legislation, 81 per cent.; for complexity of legislation, 83 per cent.; for rate of change of legislation, 79 per cent.; for interpretation of legislation, 79 per cent.; for cost of compliance, 65 per cent. Those are things that we can do something about. We ought to listen more carefully to businesses, particularly small businesses—I referred to tourism, but there are other small businesses throughout Wales, particularly in rural areas—and introduce measures that will be of assistance to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The line in the Gracious Speech that I enjoy and fear more than any other is that on page 4:
	<br><q><p>"Other measures will be laid before you."</p></q>
That covers everything. People in Wales will be looking to that sentence more than anything else in the Queen's Speech and wondering what the Government will introduce to improve the quality of life for all the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, as has been said, many of the issues that will be dealt with on the ground will be the responsibility of the National Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's continued commitment to devolution and constitutional reform. I am interested in the next stage of House of Lords reform and am committed to a Chamber that has as many elected Members as possible. I am interested in how the elected element of that Chamber will translate into representation from Wales. We await that interesting development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am committed to the continuation of devolution and interested to see how it works out. We have just celebrated the second anniversary of the National Assembly, and many people have talked about what has been achieved and what remains to be achieved. A key issue is how devolution continues to develop and how Welsh solutions to Welsh problems are developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what has been achieved. Many of us were happy to be involved with the Children's Commissioner for Wales Bill. We all agree that our working with the National Assembly to ensure that it was a high priority was a great success. I think that similar Bills are planned for Scotland and Northern Ireland and I have no doubt that England will follow, but Wales has led the way. Devolution has enabled us to develop solutions at particular times. That does not mean that they will always be different, but we may sometimes take the lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many other examples, such as free admission to national galleries, which was achieved much earlier in Wales than in England. I am well aware of that because I live near the museum in St. Fagans, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan). People who have tried to get there on a bank holiday will know that the queue now extends right up the slip road to the motorway. I believe that attendances have quadrupled. Having access to national museums and galleries again—as I did when I was a child—has liberated people in Wales, but we had to suffer during the years when that was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We mentioned greater investment in primary health care, with free dental checks and prescriptions for the under-25s. Such measures may be small in themselves, but together they shift the emphasis of the heath agenda in Wales towards primary health care and dealing with illness before it develops and hospital treatment is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no written constitution in the UK, which means that each part can develop in different ways, and it is interesting to see how each aspect of the devolution settlement differs in Wales and Scotland. I always feel fed up when people say, "Oh, I wish we did this like they do it in Scotland," because they are not considering the history of devolution and the opportunities for us to develop in ways that suit us. It will be very interesting to see how devolution develops over the period covered by the Queen's Speech and beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
I shall say a little about the health service and the issues that people raised on the doorstep. We must be honest about the problems with provision in certain parts of the health service in Wales and elsewhere. I am particularly concerned about orthopaedic waiting lists in Cardiff, North, because it is part of the Bro Taf health authority, which has a major concern about orthopaedic waiting times and lists. I therefore very much welcome the allocation of £12 million, which I hope will start to shorten those lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who raise such issues on the doorstep say that we have had four years to set things up and we can now deliver. That is their hope, and on the whole they are not looking to any other party. In my constituency, the nationalist Plaid Cymru party was hardly mentioned on the doorsteps, and nor were the other parties. Instead, questions were asked about how we had performed, and how we were going to perform. An element of trust is involved here: we are expected to deliver, and, in particular, to improve the public services. However, we should not get caught up in an agenda that always highlights the misery caused by the problems of the health service. We should state that the National Assembly for Wales is trying to shift the agenda towards a more radical approach to health, in terms of its primary services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address the questions of how devolution will develop and fit together, and also how the constitution will develop—and it is already evolving. I also want to refer—briefly, because I know that many other hon. Members want to have their say and time is short—to the Bill in the Question's Speech that will allow for greater representation of women, and to how that will affect Wales. It is an important measure that has not yet received enough publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great achievements of the National Assembly is that it has a good gender balance. Of the nine members of the Assembly's Cabinet, five are women and four are men. There are also 16 women and 12 men in the Labour group, to refer only to my own party. That good gender balance is due to the Labour party's commitment to positive action with regard to gender equality. That is right and just, and it will also produce better policies that are more representative of the interests of the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, Gro Harlem Brundtland, the then Norwegian Prime Minister, said that
	<br><q><p>"It is in the interests of society as a whole that women's values and women's sense of justice be integrated into political life"</p></q>
She made that comment when she formed a Government, nearly half of whose members were women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the run up to devolution, the Labour party in Wales and Scotland adopted a twinning policy. That was controversial—it produced headlines almost every day in 	<i>The Western Mail</i>— but it also produced the goods. I am therefore delighted that the Gracious Speech contains a commitment to introduce a Bill to enable political parties lawfully to use mechanisms to ensure that there are more women candidates. I hope that that will enable the composition of the House and of this Committee to change significantly. I also hope that it will be used to change dramatically the situation

in local government, because I think that the legislation will apply to all levels of government, and certainly to local government, where many people serve before entering the National Assembly or the Westminster Parliament.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that should be considered because ethnic minority candidates are under-represented in the National Assembly and local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great shame that the number of women elected to Parliament has fallen slightly since the election of 1997, from 18.2 to 17.9 per cent. When I arrived in Parliament four years ago, there was a record number of new Labour women, and many of them had been selected from all-women shortlists. Labour is the only party that is represented by women from Wales, and three of my four colleagues who are present now were selected from all-women shortlists, and they had to be selected from all-women shortlists. We thought that, the next time around, at the election of 2001, no such mechanism would be necessary, but, sadly, that expectation has been proved wrong—although Labour has far exceeded the other parties in all the measures that it has taken, often in the face of considerable controversy, to promote women and women's equality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the strong support for the Bill from the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) and the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), and I hope that we will therefore see a great change with regard to the candidates for the Tory party in Wales. I hope that the Bill will be speedily introduced because it would be good if it could be in place in time for the National Assembly elections to ensure that Labour keep its high percentage of women candidates, and to enable the other parties to follow our example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation is important for Wales, and it will make the politics very different in the male-dominated Committee and the Chamber of the House. I commend the Government for grasping the issue, and I believe that it shows that they are progressive, in touch with public opinion and moving in a way that will suit the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
and semicolon of my words in her speech made me wonder who had written the other parts of her most interesting and entertaining remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social security and welfare reform are important for the people of Wales. A disproportionate percentage of our people depend on benefits. We support several measures in the Government's programme, including the emphasis on work as a way out of poverty, the rise in maternity pay and extension of the period to 26 weeks, and the new pension credit, which will relieve some of the penalty on those who have been thrifty in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas, jobs are simply unavailable, and travelling long distances daily for work is not a realistic option. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn said that employment prospects have altered tremendously in his constituency. It is interesting that large numbers of his electors travel to Ireland to take up much more lucrative offers of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public transport in Wales does not allow people to travel long distances. Jobs must be available locally. Quality child care is not available either. In my constituency, many people have child care responsibilities and would like to return to work. Child care is not available, despite incentives in the working families tax credit system. I know from personal experience that Welsh-medium child care is not available at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pension credit will be welcomed, but there is a danger of further complication given the variety of benefits that older people might claim. The retirement pension, the state earnings-related pension scheme, occupational pensions, private pensions, the minimum income guarantee and the stakeholder pension are all involved, before we even begin to mention disability living allowance and other benefits or income from savings. Deciding what to claim and how to do so and coping with all the forms involved could be a nightmare for older people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of our response to the Queen's Speech, we have called for the reform of the social fund. The functioning, or, rather, malfunctioning, of the social fund will be all too familiar to members of the Committee. I discussed the fund with two of my constituents last week. The first case involved a man who had spent part of his benefit on a training course to improve his employment chances. He had organised the place himself and had paid for it out of his benefit. Perhaps he should not have done so. Perhaps he should have waited for someone else to organise it for him and to pay for it. However, he did so, and was short of Money at the end of the fortnight because he had spent the Money. He asked for help but was refused and was subject to a review. He was still short of Money when I saw him last Friday, and I suggested a crisis loan, but he had no interest in helping himself in that way. He had no interest in applying for a crisis loan because of a previous experience of the social fund, which had been quite enough for him. He went away almost penniless, with no help from me or the social fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
The second case involved a woman who had had her benefit withdrawn—unjustifiably; I hope that the error has now been corrected. She had very little Money, and I suggested that she apply for a crisis loan. To use the phrase coined by my predecessor in Caernarfon in referring to the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), she looked as if I had offered her a rat sandwich. She would not apply to the social fund either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, the Labour party set up the Commission on Social Justice, whose report is a useful and instructive document. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The most soul destroying aspect of Income Support is the Social Fund"</p></q>
Many applicants are too poor to repay a loan, so they either go without or are driven into the arms of a rapacious private sector. Others realise too late that the payments are deducted at source and that their capacity to manage the small amounts of Money that they have to live on is even more constrained. Having to make repayments to the social fund means that people are living below the income support line for Months and sometimes years. That affects the majority of claimants, as more than half have such payments deducted from benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the social fund is a fleabite in terms of the social security budget, yet accounts for much of the misery that the system inflicts. It is high time that the system was reformed. The Social Security Committee made many constructive suggestions in its recent reports. The simplest way to reform the fund would be to change the wretched loans scheme into a system of grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall endeavour to keep my comments brief. I want to focus on an issue that was important to my constituents when I spoke to them during the election—crime, particularly drug-related crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the advantages of being a candidate was being able to take part in meetings with representative groups working in the community to deal with drug-related crime. Real progress has been made. When I worked as a solicitor in Wrexham in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I spoke regularly to the police and the probation service about the way in which my clients with drug-related problems were disposed of. It seemed to me then that the police and the probation service not only failed to agree on solutions, but seldom spoke the same language. Over the past 10 years, considerable progress has been made, with teams working together and agreeing on a way forward for our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay special tribute to the team that works with young offenders in north Wales, which has helped to reduce the time taken to get young offenders to court, and worked hard with them to ensure that their options are laid out clearly before them when they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
come before the courts. It is now recognised across the penal sector that sentencing requires both a punitive and a rehabilitative element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In private conversations with police officers, I have been struck by how much they recognised the pointlessness of placing young people in custody and seeing the same people return three, six or nine Months later. They recognised that the short-term addiction to sentencing as a means of dealing with young offenders is not the way forward. We all accept that offenders must be viewed individually when they enter the system. All the different committees recognised that when a young person decides to take drugs, that is an intensely personal decision. No matter what treatment is adopted, it is also an intensely personal decision to refuse to take drugs in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an immensely serious issue, and we can all help with it; it should be addressed on a largely cross-party basis. In a debate on home affairs in the House last week, I was struck by the fact that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the right hon. Member for Maidstone and the Weald (Miss Widdecombe) appeared, surprisingly, to agree about the social element to offending as well as the punitive element of sentencing. The introduction of a social element in the speech of the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) was interesting and welcome. Drug-related crime is a huge cancer at the heart of Welsh society, and we must treat it extremely seriously. People working hard in such areas agree that it is necessary for individuals to make hard choices about drug taking. They also agree that we must educate our young people about drug abuse and its horrific consequences for them and their families. We must make it clear that there are serious health implications. We also need to emphasise that we as a society will not tolerate the crime that results from drug abuse. People in our communities are terrified to leave their homes because of the threat that it poses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who work with young offenders have a common agenda, and we must support it. It requires resources, and when we are examining such problems, we must be conscious that those who are working with young offenders need our support. Their services must be properly funded. Their work must be valued. Much positive work is being done in our communities and I am glad to have reported on some of it today. It is incumbent on all of us to support those groups and make sure that we make a real direct attack on the dreadful drug problem in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I want to talk about is the proposed communications Bill outlined in the Queen's Speech, to which no one has yet referred. It will be of great importance both to industry and to individuals in Wales. Initially it will set up Ofcom, and later it will deal with the communications industry throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. I realise that such a Bill may not be important to many people in the Committee, but broadcasting and new media will be one of the most significant drivers of the new economy for Wales in the future. We may need to pay swift and immediate attention to it. Furthermore, broadcasting and new media are absolutely essential to people's lives as citizens, as employees, and as consumers. We must ensure that Wales does not receive a second-rate deal. Unfortunately, it has received a poor deal in relation to all such issues until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the communications Bill, I hope that Wales will have more television choice in the future. One of the issues that was raised at every third doorstep I visited in the Rhondda during the general election campaign was that many people want to be able to watch both Channel 4 and SC4, and I hope that movements will be made in that direction. Whatever new system there may be for imposing quotas on the independent broadcasters, we must ensure that we have strong quality Welsh programming on Welsh television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also have in place the information technology structure throughout Wales that makes it possible for new businesses to proceed with their work. That is essential, unless we are to perpetrate further the digital divide that is already afflicting many parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to ensure that cross-media ownership is dealt with robustly in the legislation that is presented to the House. In the Rhonda, Sky already has a virtual Monopoly over digital television for anyone who wants to take a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I should like to see in the communications Bill some resolution of the long-running debate between the BBC governors and other regulatory bodies. I note that the chairman of the BBC, who is at this very moment presenting the annual report, is also still the chairman of BT. That is no longer a viable position while BT in Wales is making significant investment decisions. I hope that there will be movement on that in the near future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The opportunity for Wales is great. Wales is big enough to shine as a jewel in the UK, and it is small enough for us to unite to work together to achieve that. We have not fully utilised the opportunity to create a truly diverse tiger economy in Wales, but I am sure that we can create a society with diversity in business that progressively reduces its dependence on the social security system. However, we still want a society that enjoys a reliable, modern and fast social security system that is available to those who need it. We can create a system that the public can trust, and feel is something exceptional in the UK. We also want an exceptional education system to go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said many times before, Wales lacks confidence. The objective in the coming term, for a truly visionary Government, should be to begin to instil that confidence and strength of purpose. In that context, the Queen's Speech is something of an unopened box. It is an unknown because, as other hon. Members have said, there is precious little in it that specifically refers to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley pointed out, the Welsh content comes down to one sentence:
	<br><q><p>"My Government maintains its commitment to devolution in Scotland and Wales."</p></q>
That could go either way. [HON. MEMBERS: "What is wrong with that?"] There is nothing wrong with that, as I am sure that we all agree, but the jury is out on the extent to which the Government will deliver the services that we all wish to see. There are hints about devolution with regard to the NHS. In fairness, there is a specific reference to it. We end up in the slightly ironic position that Wales seems to be given a dispensation to save its community health councils while England seems destined to lose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech is also potentially good in terms of the development of a single regulator for the media, for the reasons that have been mentioned, particularly in the creation of a strategic approach to bilingual broadcasting. At this point, we simply cannot say for sure that there is a guarantee of delivery. We can only assess the situation in 12 Months' time when we see the extent to which the delivery follows the promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about what Plaid Cymru Members have said. I obviously agree with much of what they said because they went for what might be called the early-day motion 40 gambit, which is to steal Liberal Democrat policies and present them as their own. I applaud them for that, and I offer them the solace that far from being annoyed, we are flattered that they see the merits of our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, it is curious that Plaid Cymru have entered a mysterious pact with the Scottish nationalists. While the Scottish nationalists virtually base themselves on the sole premise of independence for Scotland, Plaid Cymru have repeatedly told us that they have never called for independence. That is rather

like a vegetarian and a carnivore saying that they share a common interest in food, and there are not sufficient grounds to be sure where Plaid Cymru is going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way to me, because I know that time is short, but did he notice that when I intervened on the hon. Member for Ceredigion he absolutely refused to answer the question about the constitutional aims of Plaid Cymru? Does he agree that it is not good enough to offer people a magical mystery tour in constitutional affairs with a short stop in Edinburgh on the way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would defend Plaid Cymru by saying that it does not have to be specific or clear on the subject; that is its choice. However, the public will draw its own conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rich for the hon. Gentleman to allege that we have swallowed all the SNP's policies. We are two distinct parties. How close is he to the Labour party in Cardiff and Edinburgh? In his own constituency he raises hell about the Labour party, but when he is in the House he sucks up to the Labour party like nobody's business. I say to him, "Get off your knees."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have; it is a miracle; I have stood again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Slightly regrettably, the hon. Gentleman described the Liberal Democrats as the whores of British politics. There is all the difference in the world between a whore and a co-operative politician who puts the interests of the people of Wales above party political interest when that is the right thing to do. I counsel him to watch and observe the fact that despite the heinous crime that he alleges I committed in the eyes of my constituents, my percentage of the vote went up by 3 per cent. That suggests that there are people in Wales who are willing to give a new kind of politics the benefit of the doubt. I reassure the representatives of Plaid Cymru that I do not condemn them for their position. I simply respectfully highlight the fact that there are those who are confused by the apparent allegiance between two parties that, according to their public statements, have radically different starting points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Conservative policy, the hon. Member for North Dorset made some interesting points about increased expenditure, which would presumably be paid for in some clever way by means of cuts. He mentioned £100 million extra capital spending for hospitals, an extra £25 million for a children's hospital, three extra surgical units and 750 more nurses, but did not explain clearly where the Money would come from to pay for them. Perhaps the Conservatives can make a cornucopia of savings but I respectfully suggest that they could make savings in administration only by removing the very administrative burdens that they themselves introduced in their time in government. Their claim does not strike me as logical, or indeed defensible. I hope that the Conservatives can find those savings, and will make them public, because we could then get on with it, implement them and thank the Conservative party, without having to raise taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
Liberal Democrats take a different view. We took a risk in the election and spoke to the public as adults: we said to people, "You get what you pay for. If you want to spend more on services, we'll have to ask you to pay a bit more in tax." Our policy of 1p extra on income tax would deliver smaller class sizes, 240 extra teachers, more books and equipment and the abolition of university tuition fees. We are the only party that has clearly costed those policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman promises to make an intervention lasting no more than 10 seconds, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 10 seconds: on subject of the honesty of the hon. Gentleman's party's commitment, why did the Liberal Democrats never mention to the public— at least in my constituency, and, I am sure, in others— that they intended to bring in an endowment tax to pay for the abolition of student tuition fees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I generously gave way to him, and the hon. Gentleman will know that we have gone as far with that in Wales as we could get his Labour colleagues to go in Scotland. That is an honest approach to dealing with a pernicious tax on learning in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats were also clear about putting 10p on the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £100,000 a year, to provide 630 extra nurses, 475 extra doctors, 295 other health professionals, including 60 dentists—my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made clear why that was so important—590 extra hospital beds and the abolition of fees for eye and dental checks. We also said that we would close some capital gains tax loopholes and significantly increase pensions, by £5 a year for single pensioners over 65 and £10 and £!5 for proportionately older pensioners. Those were real promises, with a real price tag—and for the first time in almost two decades, the Liberal Democrats' share of the poll went up, I am glad to say. Add to that our alternative Queen's Speech promise to abolish the Child Support Agency and replace it with family courts, to give young people back the benefits that they have lost, to introduce the same minimum wage for everyone over 16, and a host of other matters, including introducing the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs—another Liberal Democrat policy generously donated to the Labour Government. That agenda is true, radical and costed, and it won an increase in the percentage of the vote for the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not always easy to be a Liberal Democrat in Wales, but I promise that we shall continue to come up with the sort of radical and positive solutions that I have just outlined. This time the public really did have an alternative to the Government and their Queen's Speech. We are pleased that we made significant inroads in terms of the number of seats, and held our core seats in Powys. We have a vision for a successful Wales that becomes real when one knows how one can pay for it.

I hope that in the coming year we will be the given the chance to go ahead and implement the ideas that the people in this Room agree with, and that party politics will not always get in the way. We hope that organisations with no party affiliation and individuals from other parties, where they agree with our proposals, will help us to implement those ideas. Perhaps for the next 12 Months we can do what we all promise, which is to deliver a new brand of politics in Wales that puts the people first. That is the way to increase turnout at elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide-ranging debate, to which new Members have contributed. Some 16 Members have contributed to the debate altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend made it clear this morning, in his opening remarks, that this legislative programme focuses on delivering what the electors of Wales wanted most. We have got our priorities right and we will deliver that in this Parliament. The people of Wales want a health service that they can depend on. They want an education service that is life-long and gives every child a real start. They want to be safe and to know that their families are safe. That is why we are taking action to ensure that criminals, particularly drug pushers, will not benefit from their crimes. That is why the flagship Bills in this first Session will deal with education, health and crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service was founded by a Welshman in the face of fierce opposition from the Tories, and I am proud that the top priority of Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, for primary legislation is the reform of the NHS in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our communities have been blighted by petty crime, antisocial behaviour and drugs. Like many hon. Members in the Room, I believe that drug dealers are parasites and the blight of our community. They should be punished, and they should not benefit from the proceeds of their crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education Bill will promote excellence and diversity, allowing children to develop their talents, and the Bill for the reform and decentralisation of the NHS will give those responsible for providing public services the freedom to tailor them to their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we have had 16 contributions. I may not be able to get through all of them, but I will try to respond to as many as I possibly can. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy was quite wide-ranging in his contribution and dwelt, in part, on the experience in rural areas. He was right to do that, but I would remind him that between 1997 and 2001 the Government have made available £71 million in agrimonetary compensation and approximately £1 million to help rural businesses. There has also been the small firms loan scheme and the tax deferment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
The hon. Gentleman went on to claim that Welsh GDP was appalling. That is not the case. The latest provisional Office for National Statistics figures show that Welsh GDP increased by 3.5 per cent, in 1996–97, by 5.2 per cent, in 1997–98, and by 3.8 per cent, in the last year for which we have figures, 1998–99.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that health budgets would be raided in order to obtain match funding for objective 1. Let me remind him what the National Assembly Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communities, Edwina Hart, said at the time of the spending review, when she confirmed that the settlement that the Assembly would receive was good, and would not require the health and education budgets to be raided to provide match funding. Indeed, the July 2000 spending review settlement represented a 5.4 per cent, real terms increase in spending in Wales over the next four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complained that there had been a lack of investment in public transport. I would remind him that in the comprehensive spending review 2000, roads and public transport received very significant increases. Roads will get an extra £40 million in 2001–02, £94 million in 2002–03 and £163 million in 2003–04.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams)—I am very pleased to see her back here with a much increased majority—spoke about the fact that across Wales, particularly in the north, the voters have rejected the narrow nationalism offered by Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales. That is absolutely true. The party came third in my constituency, and just after its leader—he was still its leader last time I saw him—visited my constituency, there was a 34 per cent, swing to Labour. I wish that he would come more often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can certainly endorse the points made by the hon. Lady about the university of Wales, Bangor, and the fact that it is a beacon university in terms of encouraging an entrepreneurial approach to the economy. I met some of the staff of the university in north Wales last week, and I was greatly impressed by what I learned from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend went on to refer to the dispute at Friction Dynamics in Caernarfon. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has met representatives of the Transport and General Workers Union, which represents the work force there. It is certainly with regret that I hear that 87 strikers have received redundancy notices. I urge all sides to maintain dialogue and involve the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service as necessary, as that is the one way to end that awful dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset, representing the Tory party in exile, certainly made a speech. It was a little over-long, and sought to create a litany of what he believed were the Government's failings. He simply ignored the fact that, whatever the shortcomings of our party, his was roundly rejected in the general election campaign when it proposed £20 billion of cuts. He referred to problems with NHS waiting lists in Wales, but in the past year there has been a significant reduction of almost 10,000 in the number of people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
waiting for in-patient and day care in Wales. That is an improvement, and represents movement in the right direction. He also talked about problems with NHS funding in Wales—but since May 1997 the NHS in Wales has received £590 million more, which is far more than the Government whom he supported ever gave to the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Alan Howarth), making, I think, his maiden speech to the Welsh Grand Committee, talked about the need to make the voice of Wales clear in this place. I endorse that. He certainly made clear the voices of his constituents who miss their jobs at Corus and Llanwern, and he has dedicated his efforts to ensure that their voice is not ignored. I share his view that the resource package put together by the Government and the Assembly should be put into use without delay. He also stressed the need for accountability and transparency on public-private initiatives, and I endorse that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire was worried about the loss of country schools. He highlighted the problems experienced by youngsters at secondary schools who have to travel long distances, and also mentioned the plans to close the GP-led fertility service in his constituency. Of course, those are matters for the National Assembly, but the NHS Bill for Wales will be the chance to highlight how we might tackle such problems in the NHS. I am pleased that he welcomed our success in reducing class sizes. He also mentioned meat imports, which are governed by longstanding European legislation. European instruments are regularly revised and, if anything, strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Dr. Francis) talked about the social and economic deprivation in his constituency, which he was right to emphasise. I welcome the Community First scheme, which was announced in the Assembly a week or so ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) referred to what he described as disillusion rather than apathy at the general election. Whatever it was, we need to tackle it, because we must re-engage as many of our electors as we can, to protect and defend the democratic process. I agree that the Welsh Grand Committee is relevant to the future of Wales. Despite the rhetoric of Plaid Cymru, there is no doubt that the hon. Gentleman's party was roundly rejected across Wales in the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the need for a public inquiry into the foot and mouth outbreak. I refer him to a statement made by my right hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last week. She said that the Government had made it clear that there would be a full inquiry into the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn to the Committee. He made a good speech, with important points about the need to create jobs in his constituency. The creation of more jobs and more investment is the No. 1 priority that we have to keep our eye on in Wales, so that we can achieve our goal of full employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley referred to the abuse of NHS staff. He is right to highlight that. When we discuss the draft Bill on the NHS for Wales, perhaps that will be taken into account. I hope that it will be. He also spoke about the problems of crime, which I certainly believe that we are tackling. I say to him what I said to the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) in the Chamber last week: the Conservative party lost the general election with its campaign for £20 million in cuts, so his conversion to public spending would make even St. Paul blush.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) made some important points about the children's commissioner. There has been a pilot scheme in Wales and in other parts of the country. That is important too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the comments of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams), who gave his support to the welfare reforms; I think that he will find a lot of cross-party support. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) expressed concern about crime, and I believe that the Bills that will help with that will come before the House quite shortly. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda made an important point about communication, which is important for Wales. I congratulate the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) on his elevation to shadow Secretary of State for Wales; he certainly does not lack confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
