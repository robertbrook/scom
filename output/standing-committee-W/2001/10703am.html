	<time>Tuesday 3 July 2001</time>
	<p>[MR. WIN GRIFFITHS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Oral Answers to Questions</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first question, it may be helpful for new Members if I explain that Question Time in the Welsh Grand Committee operates in the same way as Question Time in the Chamber. When called, Members will give the number of their question; once the Minister has replied, I will call the same Member to ask a supplementary question. Other Members may then be called to ask further supplementary questions. I want to call as many Members as possible, so I request that all Members ask brief supplementary questions and Ministers give concise answers. I must also tell the Committee that Questions 6 and 8 are to be grouped together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked—</i></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Objective One</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1.	<div class='member'>Mr. Dai Havard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with the First Secretary of the National Assembly about the progress of objective 1 programmes in Wales. [2227]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the First Secretary regularly and we discuss a range of issues. I was particularly pleased to see that the Assembly has approved more than £200 million worth of European grants and £200 million of match funding over the past two Months, giving the go-ahead to 289 projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Havard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that objective 1 and other European schemes are not a panacea but a catalyst for rebuilding our economic capacity? One key element is confidence, and will he condemn those who try to reopen settled issues concerning both the description of the scheme and the funding arrangements? Will he encourage such people to see the scheme in context, with other measures that have been adopted both by the Government and by private sector employers to rebuild that capacity in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that question, and I agree that objective 1 is only one of many ways in which the Welsh economy can be improved. It is enormously important, because £1.3 billion over seven years is a great deal of Money, which will ensure that we raise our gross domestic product in Wales, but it is also right for my hon. Friend to refer to the other measures that the Government have introduced to improve our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the fact that about £340 million of match funding must be found between 2001 and 2004 by the National Assembly, will the right hon. Gentleman assist as best he can and secure extra Money from the Treasury to help the process? As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Havard) said, objective 1 is not a panacea for all ills, but it is still an important scheme. I urge the Minister to do his best to secure additional funding along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his viewpoint. I agree with much of it in that we understand that parts of his area of Wales, as well as the valleys, all benefit from objective 1 funding. As he knows, we had more than £400 million over and above the Barnett formula in the previous financial settlement. That was welcome news for Wales, and we will continue to press for Money to come to Wales for objective 1 funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that it will be the private sector that will produce the extra jobs in Wales and create the wealth, and that we must do all we can to work closely with it and ensure that it has the tools to do the job? I held a joint meeting in my constituency last week at which my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen spoke. There is still a thirst for knowledge about objective 1 in the private sector, and we must co-operate closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend—but I must just remind him that I am the Member for Torfaen and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary represents Islwyn. We both agree that the private sector is enormously important in objective 1 projects. My experience from my previous job in the Northern Ireland Office is that the Government know that the private sector has a crucial role to play, and I hope that firms in Wales, both large and small, will take advantage of objective 1 funding. They have another six years to go, and it is important that meetings such as that held last week by my hon. Friend are held throughout Wales to encourage the private sector to take part in objective 1 schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Private Companies (Rural Employment)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What assessment he has made of the impact of announcements by private companies relating to employment opportunities in rural areas of Wales made in the last Month. [2228]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the recent announcement by Triplex Components Group Ltd. safeguarding the future of 120 jobs at Kings Triplex Holdings in Llanidloes, and, we hope, those of all 150 people who currently work there. I was also pleased to hear Laura Ashley confirm that it will create 120 jobs in Newtown and Carno over the next three years. Those are welcome developments at a time when much of the rural economy of Powys is struggling with the devastating effects of the foot and mouth outbreak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his answer. Does he agree that those developments are a tribute to teamwork by the town of Llanidloes, the Welsh Development Agency, the Assembly, local politicians, the work force and their unions? Does he also agree that that is an example of what can be achieved if we take a strategic approach towards investment in non-agricultural businesses in rural areas, which is important? Let us remember that a wide diversity of job opportunities helps any economic environment, making it less likely to collapse if there is a crisis in one sector, such as the foot and mouth outbreak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the work that he has done in connection with this week's good news that jobs will be safeguarded. The Government, the Assembly, local authorities and trade unions worked closely together. I repeat what the hon. Gentleman has said on several occasions: small as the companies may seem in terms of employee numbers, they are relatively very important to rural Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware of the recent announcement by Aberthaw power station in the rural vale of Glamorgan that if today's European Parliament announcement on control of emissions goes against it, that could result in its premature closure? That would have a devastating effect not only on my constituency and those of my hon. Friends—I am thinking, for example, of Tower collieries and the clearance of tips in Merthyr Tydfil—but on the whole of south Wales. Such a closure could undermine the secure supply of energy for new investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point about employment prospects in his constituency and at Tower in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), but this goes far further. We should take a great interest in what is happening in the European Parliament, and various Members of the European Parliament who represent Wales have taken different views on the matter. The Labour Members were concerned about the impact of emissions, and I have talked to Glenys Kinnock, among others. We remain very much involved with our colleagues there, because we understand that employment prospects could be affected if the directive goes through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State not accept that his answer is enormously complacent? A Dun and Bradstreet report says that five Welsh businesses are closing every day, mainly as a result of foot and mouth, and one agricultural supplier has lost 98 per cent, of his income; that is not just the icing on the cake, but the cake itself. Surely we need a vibrant farming industry, off which other industries can thrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State accept that people need to know where the buck stops? Is it not a fact that responsibility is being shuffled around from the Secretary of State to Ministers and Secretaries in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Welsh Assembly, and that they are fiddling while Wales and its businesses burn? Is it not about time that someone took responsibility and came up with an action plan that will assist Welsh businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, that is a little dramatic, even for the hon. Gentleman. On subject of the Dun and Bradstreet business failure survey, he knows that, despite a rise in business failures in 2001, business failures in Wales in the first six Months are well down on those in the corresponding period in 2000. What the hon. Gentleman says is not quite right. Relatively, Wales has done much better than other parts of the United Kingdom. I accept, of course, the hon. Gentleman's point about the impact of foot and mouth on rural areas, and particularly on tourism. He knows—I answered him in the House last week—that the Government and the Assembly are introducing measures that go a long way towards ensuring that we overcome those problems. It is not easy; the Money is not unlimited and it takes time. The hon. Gentleman must understand that the partnership between the Government and the Assembly is working. We are doing all that we can, jointly, to alleviate problems. No doubt the issue will crop up again later in today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I regularly meet ministerial colleagues, including the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, to discuss a wide range of issues, including the Government's new deal programme. The new deal programme has proved successful in Wales and we are keen to build on that success by extending the new deal to over-25s who have been on jobseeker's allowance for at least 18 Months.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that answer. When there is enough Money to recruit policemen, we need to ensure that they are of the right quality. We want the police back on the streets preventing crime.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements for funding higher and further education students in England and Wales are working well, with applications for places continuing to rise. Tuition for students from lower income families continues to be free, and those experiencing difficulty with living costs can apply to the Assembly for assistance from access and hardship funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his reply, the Secretary of State did not mention the Rees report. If he has not yet had an opportunity to read it, may I ask him to do so? It makes interesting reading. Of course, if he has not read the report, he cannot agree or disagree with it. However, when he reads it, he will agree with a fact underlined in the report: that despite all the furore about tuition fees—which the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) and I know all about— maintenance grants are in fact the most important issue facing the higher education sector in Wales at present. Does he agree that we cannot sacrifice higher education in Wales on the altar of the Barnett formula? What will he now do in Cabinet to restate, and to allow to be restated in Wales, the need for the further element of a means-tested maintenance grant? If we do not regain that, we will not be able to invest in the future of young people in Wales. That is central to our economic future, along with objective 1 and other things that have been mentioned this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the main recommendations of the Rees report. As the hon. Gentleman knows, some of those recommendations are matters for the Assembly, and some are matters for the Government. The Government will read the report with interest and reflect on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even when I went to university, a balance had to be found between contributions from parents, from the university, and from Government. There has been a huge increase in the number of people who go to university since I went all those years ago, when the rate was 5 per cent—and we want it to rise even further, to 50 per cent. I understand the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, and we will examine the different issues that the report highlights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend agree to speak to his colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills about the main recommendations in the Rees report—which I know that he has read? Does he agree that many of the recommendations are relevant to central Government? Does he also agree that despite the fact that 50 per cent, of students in Wales will not pay tuition fees, it appears that students from lower income households are being put off higher education
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
because of the complications of funding arrangements, or the fear of debt caused by taking on loans? Does the Minister agree that women, mature students and black and Asian students, in particular, are put off going into higher education for those reasons? Will he ask his ministerial colleagues to consider the recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has asked an awful lot of questions. First, I shall certainly discuss the matter, and its implications for Wales, with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rees report touched on the subject of loans, indicating that a much tighter regime was wanted to ensure that people from lower income backgrounds benefit and that the extremely high participation rates in higher education continue. There is no indication of a drop-off in participation; on the contrary, the numbers of people going into higher education have increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to point out that in Wales about half of students pay no fee; only about a third pay the full amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his talks with the Welsh Assembly, will my right hon. Friend warn against the possibility of the Assembly's walking down the path laid out by the Scottish Parliament? The abandonment of tuition fees and the introduction of graduate endowment in Scotland has resulted in the students from the poorest backgrounds inheriting a larger debt than they would under the present system. Some straight talking is needed, but unfortunately some politicians indulge in a great deal of crooked talking in order to gain political benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not up to me to warn the Assembly about anything, but I shall bring to its attention the points that my hon. Friend has rightly made. He referred to the claim that student fees in Scotland have been abolished; they have not. The coalition Government in Scotland considered the issue and decided that they wanted a different system, whereby fees have to be paid afterwards rather than up front. That is generally misunderstood in the rest of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr.Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To date in Wales there have been 16,041 compensation payments, totalling £75.5 million paid out; £38.7 million was paid to claimants for respiratory diseases and £36.8 million to those claiming compensation under vibration white finger schemes. Much remains to be done but I am encouraged by what has been achieved so far, especially by co-operation with the coal health claims Monitoring group, set up by my right hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Secretary of State, which met yesterday. It has made progress in speeding up claims for compensation in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone acknowledges that the Labour Government are delivering; the previous Tory Government and British Coal resisted miners' claims for years. Nevertheless, there is much frustration and annoyance in my constituency. Some of the angriest scenes I encountered during the election campaign involved ex-miners. One, a man of 92 asked, "Where is my Money?" I would not argue with a man of that age who asked such a question; one has to ask, "Where is his Money?"—and the answer is that his Money is caught up in a bureaucratic mess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the claims are enormous and that no one has had to deal with such large amounts before. I have a letter about a man with white finger, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is noted that in December 2000, the Minister said an offer would be made within two weeks. The process was set in motion that was unfortunately delayed when the DSS did not supply a Certificate of Recoverable Benefits."</p></blockquote>
Another case concerns a man who died; his widow is waiting for compensation, but I was told that the local health authority was being obstructive in allowing access to hospital scans and other records. That is bureaucracy. Surely there is some way of ensuring that Departments are joined up and bureaucratic bungling is eliminated, so that the miners who are waiting for their compensation get it as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend's steadfast support for the mining community, not just in the great battle to keep Tower, but over miners' compensation. She has worked extremely hard. She has been diligent and has given huge support to everyone who has campaigned throughout the coalfields. The unions in particular value that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are totally committed to meeting their responsibility to pay compensation under the lung function disease compensation scheme and the vibration white finger scheme. Indeed, one in three of all claimants in Wales has now received a payment of some sort: a bereavement payment for widows, full and final settlement or an interim payment. I share my hon. Friend's concern, particularly for the most elderly miners, who feel that the system is taking far too long. I have not met a miner yet who wants this for the Money; they simply want their suffering to be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priority as set down by the Monitoring group in Wales and supported by the Department of Trade and Industry is that compensation should be given first to the oldest miners, those who are most ill, and widows. We are pressing ahead with that as fast as we can. There are awful glitches in the scheme; we heard about some instances yesterday. However, the forum that my right hon. Friend has set up in Wales is making a difference. If my hon. Friend gives us the details of the particular cases that she mentioned, we will take them to the Monitoring group to see whether we can overcome the difficulties and move things forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[2236]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and Wales Office officials maintain regular contact with the Treasury, particularly concerning consequential funds for the National Assembly arising from UK Government initiatives to help deal with the impact of the foot and mouth crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that answer, but it brings little relief to small tourist businesses in Powys. I met two groups over the weekend, the Beacons Trust and the Powys Rural Business Campaign. They both made it clear that some small businesses will not survive the lean winter that lies ahead, and are taking advantage of the extra promotion being promised by the Welsh tourist board. They also noted that the Treasury has made extra funding available to regional development agencies in England to deal with the crisis in Cumbria and Devon. They would like similar allocations to be made for Powys. Powys is a special case. We have no coastline to compensate for the countryside. Our tourist attractions are very good, but they are few and far between. The countryside is all in Powys, and unless we have some help many businesses will not survive the winter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's concern about what has been happening to the tourist industry, in our rural areas in particular. Securing adequate funds for Wales is one of the top priorities of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and he has a proud record of delivery. In June this year the Wales Office claimed consequential funds of about £750,000 for the Assembly as a result of additional funding provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help rural businesses to recover from the impact of foot and mouth disease on tourism. In addition, the Assembly will receive a further £350,000 from a £6 million fund announced by the English Tourism Council and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spending of those funds is a matter for the Assembly, but the UK Government have taken a number of initiatives, including providing support under the small firms loan guarantee scheme. There have been arrangements for deferment of tax, VAT and national insurance payments, all without penalty, to help small rural businesses. I also remind the hon. Gentleman of the Assembly's own £12 million initiative to help local authorities to provide business rate relief in rural areas. The Wales tourist board has announced a further £1.1 million to help relaunch tourism in Wales.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Those initiatives are building blocks to try to rebuild confidence within the community in tourism in Wales, and they also recognise the particular difficulties that constituents such as those of the hon. Gentleman suffer as a result of the outbreak of foot and mouth. I came down through his constituency from north Wales this week, and I urge as many people as possible to visit our beautiful countryside wherever it is possible and safe to do so. The area has much to offer, and I hope that we can do much more to help the businesses to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
That the Committee has considered the matter of the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech as it relates to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by paying tribute to you, Mr. Griffiths, as the new Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee. You and I were elected to the House of Commons on the same day. You have had a distinguished career not just in the House, but in the European Parliament, where you were a vice-president, and as a Minister of the Crown in the old Welsh Office. You have enormous experience, which you will bring profitably to us all in the Committee. I am sure that every member of the Committee, irrespective of party, welcomes your appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome all new Members of the House to the Committee. It is unusual for a Welsh Grand Committee to sit so early in a new Session of Parliament, so it is good to see that all the new Welsh Members are present, particularly as there has been an unusually high turnover of MPs. The Committee will be enriched by their presence. I pay similar tribute to the oldies—people such as myself—who have been returned to the House. I wish them well in the new Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the Welsh Grand Committee needs to be examined occasionally and we need to reflect on why we meet in the House according to such a format. It is important that we meet in this way. Everyone knows that 40 Members of Parliament represent the people of Wales in the House, and our Committee gives us an opportunity, which has perhaps become more significant since devolution, to talk about various matters, some of which may be devolved, but which have a resonance for us all because we are public representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reserved matters for which the Government are responsible also have a particular significance in Wales. That is why it is especially appropriate that we discuss the Queen's Speech, which covers both devolved and non-devolved areas, in the Welsh Grand Committee. The Committee is a forum that enables us to hold such discussions and to ensure that we represent our constituents by raising issues that affect them. In the half hour during which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I took questions, most members of the Committee raised issues that affect their constituencies, and it is right that that should happen. Our Committee gives Members representing Welsh constituencies the opportunity to get together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that the Committee should occasionally meet in Wales. I do not suggest that we should always meet in Cwmbran, but it was helpful when we did. We should meet in every part of Wales— north, south and mid-Wales. Meeting in Wales would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
allow us to liaise with our colleagues in the National Assembly, who, like hon. Members, are elected to represent the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little disappointed at the actions last week of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). Although Wales has no Conservative Members of Parliament, a lot of people voted Conservative and it is important that their voice is heard in the Committee. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a Conservative Member of Parliament would not want to give members of his party an opportunity to attend the Committee. What happened was a bit of a farce. When asked about the matter, Conservative central office issued a press release, which was quoted in the Western Mail:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The party has more important things to worry about until we have a new leader."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) will convey to his hon. Friends the importance of their attending the Committee and making a contribution. On this occasion, we have rescued them and allowed them to attend the debate, but that message should get home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Member of Parliament who represents a Welsh constituency should have received the same message during the general election. It was encapsulated in the opening sentences of the Gracious Speech, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Government's central objectives are economic stability and investment and reform in public services leading to a more prosperous and inclusive society."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To this end my Government will continue to secure low inflation and sound public finances … My Government's main priorities for the forthcoming Session will be reform in education, health, crime and welfare."</p></blockquote>
Those messages came home to every one of us in the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Secretary of State to the next paragraph, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will provide new opportunities for school sponsorship."</p></blockquote>
What is meant by that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to consider how the legislation will apply to Wales, but, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall come to education later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our role in the devolution settlement is to fulfil two functions in respect of devolved matters: first, to ensure that we get the resources, which I shall come to in a moment, and, secondly, to provide the legislative tools to enable the Assembly to go about its business in delivering the services that it is charged to deliver. On non-devolved matters, we shall play our part in the House of Commons and as legislators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the doorsteps, people made little of who delivered the services, provided that they were delivered. After two years of devolution, they are aware that there are matters for the Assembly to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
deliver, but that did not prevent the people whom we represent from talking to us about hospitals, schools and public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's message in the House of Commons last week about delivery applies just as much to Wales as to England, but in a different form. The Assembly is conscious that it needs to deliver the services, because, in two years, its Members will also have to face the Welsh electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all understand why the Labour party was returned with a majority of 167 for a second, historic term, and the same number of Labour Members were elected in Wales in 2001 as in 1997. That is unprecedented in the political history of Wales, and we need to re-emphasise why the people of Wales decided to give Labour that second large majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that we were not disappointed with the turnout; we were. It dropped in every constituency, and in some more than others. All parties must address that fact in the next two years, because fewer and fewer people are turning out to vote. That is true of not only the previous election, but the 1997 election. We do not want it to happen again in the National Assembly elections, the local government elections or, for that matter, the next general election. Indeed, a subject for future debate in the Committee may be how we can best involve people in Wales in the political process and life of our nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the low turnout does not discount the vastness of our victory or the reasons behind it. It happened because people believed that the Government had introduced economic stability, which we sometimes take for granted. We were able to increase the resources for the National Assembly from £8 billion to £10 billion, because we established the backbone of economic stability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. It is crucial that interest rates have been kept down, that mortgages are as low as they have been for many years and that inflation is also low. I know that my hon. Friend is bound to agree with everything I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is correct; I agree with everything, but wish to add something. We delivered not only an increased budget, but Money to Wales over and above Barnett in order to take in objective 1, and it is on the delivery of objective 1 that I want to question him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delivery of objective 1 in Wales is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Economic Development, Mike German. Has my right hon. Friend had an opportunity to read either the independent report by the Welsh Joint Education Committee, which alleges fraud and is now properly a matter for the police, or the second report on the governance and financial management of the European unit of the WJEC, run by Mike German, which alleges incompetence? Such a cloud over the person primarily concerned with the delivery of objective 1 Money is clearly a matter of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. Is it in order for hon. Members to make a point alleging fraud when the police are investigating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, no court case is taking place and, because such comments are merely allegations, they can be raised in Committee in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in Question Time, the objective 1 programme will be hugely important for both rural and urban Wales. The fact that 289 projects have already been approved in the first year, which represents about £400 million altogether, is of tremendous significance to us all. It would not be right for me to comment here on my hon. Friend's point about the Deputy First Minister. I have received the report, although I have not had an opportunity to read it, and I believe that the position in the Assembly with regard to any investigation has been made perfectly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the economic stability that has been achieved by the Government, other measures have been introduced, which are important because they apply throughout the United Kingdom, not just in Wales. The fact that we introduced the minimum wage and the working families tax credit, that child benefit has increased and that we have helped pensioners in so many ways is important for Welsh people. I say to hon. Members who represent rural constituencies that those measures are just as important to someone who lives in the middle of rural Wales as to someone who lives in the middle of a valley, city or seaside resort. They have helped people throughout Wales, and it is important that we recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background, so what about the Gracious Speech and how it affects Wales? It is important to emphasise that all our proposals are backed by the general situation that I have just described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Secretary of State will accept that, in some senses, there is a fair degree of disillusionment with Government performance. Will he respond to continuing concerns about waiting lists and the lack of provision in education, where a huge opportunity and a huge majority have, to some extent, been squandered? Much more Money could have been put in and many people still feel that the Government have not been sufficiently radical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I do not agree with that. If one looks at past settlements, and my political memory goes back to the 1960s, it is clear that nothing like the present sum was put into public services in Wales. People told us on the doorsteps that they understood that we had improved the economy and put in the Money, but they stressed that the next stage is to ensure that it gets to the front line, which, in most cases in Wales, is the responsibility of the Assembly. Nevertheless, we hold joint responsibility for delivery in some examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must also consider this: if disillusionment means a majority of 167 in the House of Commons for a second-term Labour Government,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I do not know what would have happened if there had been no disillusionment. I shall do my best to answer points about education and health, but we have to be careful in the Committee, because those matters are now devolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree that resources have been excellent and we are pleased with the amount that has been allocated, but I should like to refer to a point that we raise repeatedly in the Committee. In England and Scotland, health resources are allocated on the basis of deprivation, but there is no such arrangement in Wales. Those of us who represent deprived areas want to know when the Welsh Assembly will make the decision about the reallocation of health resources so that those communities that are particularly deprived can benefit from that reallocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Few communities are as deprived as those represented by my hon. Friend. I understand that. As a valley MP, I sympathise with the point that she makes. A report that is before the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales considers those very issues and obviously we await its findings with interest. As usual, my hon. Friend makes her points tellingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go through the details of every Bill, because hon. Members will have read what lies behind them. I shall simply point out how they will operate in Wales. Labour Members will recall that one of our five pledges was to seize the assets of drug dealers. The criminal justice Bill and the proceeds of crime Bill were both in the Queen's Speech. The Bill to reform the welfare system and the pension credit Bill are of enormous importance to us in Wales. We have often discussed in Committee the plight of those pensioners who are not poor enough to receive as many benefits as they should. Those pensioners in the middle ground are to be helped by the new pension credit system. The ComMonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill is enormously important to us, particularly to hon. Members representing Llandudno and Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are Bills that relate to Assembly responsibilities, although in certain respects there is no need or wish for substantial difference between Wales and England. Three affect us in Wales, but there is general agreement that we can operate together. The first is the adoption and children Bill. It is particularly important for us in Wales for a number of reasons, not just because of the Kilshaws in north Wales, although we should ensure that international adoption is considered. The Prime Minister set up the working party on adoption the day after I presented the Waterhouse report to the House of Commons. Furthermore, we recognised that adoption was too slow and we wanted to ensure that family life helped children in a special way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend stress that the proposed register needs to cover the UK—Wales, Scotland and the whole of England—rather than be split into regions? That should ensure that the maximum number of children are found appropriate homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is an important point. I have discussed the issue with Jane Hutt, the Minister for Health and Social Services, who has responsibility for those matters in Wales. The Assembly and the Government have worked well together to ensure a common approach. As my hon. Friend knows, the administration of adoption in Wales is the responsibility of the Assembly and local authorities, but taking different approaches in that respect does not make sense, which is why we worked together so carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The communications Bill is to be published in draft form. It is important to Wales that Ofcom acts as a single regulator, and the Bill will also safeguard bilingual broadcasting. Its draft publication will provide Members of Parliament and the Assembly with the opportunity to examine it carefully. The Homelessness Bill, which also has an important resonance in Wales and which aims to deal with homeless people more effectively, received a Second Reading yesterday. Those Bills have been introduced and they show how the Government and the Assembly can work together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two Bills deal with education and health. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned education. I assume that he was referring to the education Bill, which will, in respect of Wales, be permissive. That means that the Assembly will be able to enact any framework established by the Bill, if it so desires. As I said to the Assembly last week, there is great merit in including as many permissive clauses in Bills as we can, because they will enable it to decide how best to implement various reforms through legislation. That applies to any Bill that affects the devolved functions of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the education Bill is to drive up standards in secondary schools, to promote diversity and, to deal with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, to increase the freedom of schools to innovate. Our aim is to make it possible to tailor educational provision from the age of 14 to the talents of each pupil. It is important to drive up standards so that children acquire the skills to make something of their lives. If that means looking for greater diversity in education, I agree with it. We already have diversity in Welsh secondary education. Of the eight comprehensives in my constituency, two are different: one is Catholic and the other is a Welsh language school. That offers diversity of comprehensive education and meets the needs of different people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is up to the Assembly to consult in Wales. It will do so and then decide how best to move the agenda forward. However, whether private funds should be used for education will be a matter for the Assembly to decide. I do not want to pre-empt the Assembly's debates, but we must all focus on improving standards in secondary education. We tackled primary education quite substantially over the past four years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the most important consideration for Welsh education is ensuring that schools such as Glan Ely high in my constituency, which was twice labelled a failing school by the inspectorate, have the freedom and opportunity to diversify and grow? That requires funding and we must properly reward the work of teachers and pupils in that school. Children from Ely should have the same opportunities as other children attending schools in wealthier parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend is right to point out that diversity already exists in Wales, and my constituency has a Welsh medium secondary school, a Church in Wales school and a Catholic school. Does he agree that the priority should be ensuring that kids who attend schools such as Glan Ely have the same opportunities as kids from wealthier backgrounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree with my hon. Friend. He comes from the same valley as myself, and will recall that areas such as Trevethin and Pen-y-Garn in the middle of it are similar to parts of Ely. The Assembly is considering a proposal for a similar community school to be built there, which would bring nothing but benefits to our young people. My hon. Friend and I share something else: we both taught for many years and understand the importance of ensuring that standards improve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State gives way to me, perhaps I should address him as "Paul"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one doubts that standards need to be raised. I am sure that that is accepted across the political spectrum. I am, however, concerned about sponsorship, because I have it in mind that some large companies in the UK will be keen to become involved with schools for their own benefit and nothing else. In any event, how many of those companies will want to be associated with schools that are currently failing? The problem is that the gap between schools could become even larger. I put exactly the same question to the Prime Minister last week, but did not receive an answer, so I shall try again with the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer the question as far as I can, but the delivery of education in Wales is for the National Assembly to consider. I hope that it will consider the involvement of a private company if it thinks that that is sensible and will help a particular school. Governors, local education authorities and the Assembly will consider any such scheme carefully, and proceed with it only if it can improve the way in which a school is run. I have to tread warily, because it is not for us to decide how that happens. In general, I see nothing wrong with private sector involvement in education so long as we Monitor it properly. The local education authorities and others who are responsible for education are aware of what is going on, and it improves education and drives up standards. That is what is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Lucas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can assist the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I regret that I have the misfortune to live in England— although only by about five miles, and I look forward to remedying that defect shortly. In the constituency of the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)—perhaps living there counts as an even greater defect than merely living in England—there is an education action zone, which was introduced shortly after the 1997 election. I believe that it attracted sponsorship from British Telecom among others. It was very much the brainchild of local head teachers, who did a lot of work to bring the benefits of private investment to local schools. It has been extremely successful. My own children have benefited, and the zone has recently been extended. That is an example of positive private investment. Nothing adverse has arisen from it, and it has linked industry and local schools in a positive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that useful intervention, which shows how we can work in partnership with the private sector in education where it is sensible to do so. There is a good example of a PFI scheme sponsored by the Assembly at Ysgol Gyfun Penweddig in Aberystwyth, and another successful one in Pembrokeshire was mentioned the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) is run not by Labour, but by Plaid Cymru. There are two school projects there, and Councillor Whittle, the leader of the council, said in a press release that he was delighted to see the schemes get off the ground. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority was impressed with the exciting plans drawn up by the Machrie Consortium and we are confident the scheme will be a shining example of a successful working partnership between the public and private sectors."</p></blockquote>
I understand the points that have been made. One is about construction and the other is about revenue and the way in which schools are run. I merely point out that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with a partnership between the public and private sectors to improve public services in Wales, so long as the people concerned understand what is happening and it is used sensibly. I have given examples of schools that have been built in Wales because of such a partnership, and hospitals have also been built. I repeat that how to go down that path is entirely a matter for the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS reform and decentralisation Bill will particularly affect public services in England, but also has some significance for Wales. It will enable us to place 75 per cent, of national health service spending power directly in the hands of front-line professionals. Professional self-regulation will be a matter both for England and for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will also be the national health service Bill for Wales, which is to be published in draft and which, as most hon. Members know, will provide a legislative framework for the development of health policy in Wales. It will put into operation the NHS Wales plan, and ensure that nursing, midwifery, health visiting, the setting up of local health groups and so on, are carefully considered. It will put into practice the NHS
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
plan to which the Assembly has agreed. As the Queen said in the Gracious Speech, the Bill is in draft form because that will enable the Committee of the National Assembly that deals with health, and the Welsh Grand Committee, to look at it in detail. Parts of the plan may need to be brought forward earlier rather than later; that possibility is being discussed with Jane Hutt. If it is, we will try to ensure that the Bill relating to the NHS in England is used as a vehicle to put through time-sensitive measures. The precedent by which the draft Bill will go before both the Assembly and the House is a good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for the last 10 minutes of his speech, which is the most serious analysis that we have ever heard, in this Committee or in the House, of the way in which devolution has worked in the Wales Office and the National Assembly. I particularly welcome what he said about permissive legislation, and his announcement to the Assembly that he wanted more permissive legislation in the House. He may have learned lessons from the past—the Local Government Act 2000, for example, imposed policies on local government in Wales that neither the Assembly nor councillors in Wales wanted. It would have been far better to give the National Assembly an enabling permissive clause. Now the Secretary of State has altered his position—the sinner has repented—and this morning he has given us a very different view of the relationship between his Office and the National Assembly. I welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has made some significant comments this morning. I hope that he will continue in the vein that he has outlined, and that we will all have an opportunity to consider where in primary legislation we can give the Assembly enabling powers to enact matters that are already devolved to it; it is crazy for the Assembly to come running back to the House every year to enact such matters. We should look ahead as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for those remarks. It is easier when there is a Labour Government and a Labour-led Assembly, because we agree on things. The real test would come if there were different parties in power—but I hope and assume that that will not be the case for a long time. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about permissive regulation. The Local Government Act 2000 contained much permissive legislation and made a difference—for example, in terms of the way in which local authorities govern themselves politically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to the consideration of the NHS Bill for Wales by the National Assembly and by, as he put it, "us" Did he mean by that the House of Commons or the Welsh Grand Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I meant the hon. Gentleman, me and everyone else here. The process by which that consideration happens is a matter for the business managers. It would not be for me to interfere in that rather Byzantine method of dealing with our business.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
It is important to give the Welsh Grand Committee the opportunity to look specifically at the clauses of a Bill—but we must not undermine the Standing Committee system. As the hon. Gentleman said, the rules of the House allow our Committee to become a Standing Committee if we so wish, but he must bear in mind the fact that in that case there would have to be a balance in the party representation. As he can see, the Committee is slightly unbalanced at present—I am delighted to say—as a consequence of the 7 June election. Whatever mechanism we use, we should be able to examine the Bill in detail before it enters the formal legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Gracious Speech included the following sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Government maintain their commitment to devolution in Scotland and Wales."</p></blockquote>
Sometimes we forget how quickly changes have come about in four years. One hundred years had passed since Keir Hardie sponsored the idea of devolution, but the Labour Government implemented it in four years. That is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dai Havard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may think that I was woken up by the reference to Keir Hardie, but in fact I wanted to say something earlier about the role of the various institutions of Government, which we have been discussing this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general election was very interesting. It was the first post-devolution general election and, as my right hon. Friend said, people were discussing the delivery of services, including the health service, and how those things that in detail might be seen to be devolved to the Assembly are inextricably linked with standards that are set, and Money that is provided, elsewhere. That was seminal; people began to understand that as much investment and Money conies into Wales from other government institutions of the UK as is controlled by and through the National Assembly. Therefore, the interrelationship between what the Assembly does and what Government do is crucial to their lives, and they know that the two must be joined up. How the institutions make that work is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering what has been said about devolution, perhaps the Welsh Grand Committee would like to meet in Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney again. Even the Tories would be welcome—although the last Tory of any note who came to Merthyr was the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), and she said that she did not understand why she was there in the rain, or what she had done to William to make him send her there. If anyone is going to fall off a donkey and have a conversion, perhaps it will be the Tories in Merthyr.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. Lady did not change her mind because of a visit to Merthyr Tydfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Welsh Grand Committee and as Members of the House of Commons, we are as much a part of the devolution settlement as our colleagues in Cardiff are. We work together, represent the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
people and, in partnership, can take forward the reforms and improvements in service delivery that will be the theme of the forthcoming debate. When people voted for us again, as they did in very large numbers on 7 June, they told us in no uncertain terms what their priorities were. They expect us to deliver resources to Wales for education and health and to pass laws to enable the Assembly to deliver those services, to reduce crime, tackle poverty, help our pensioners, and run a strong, stable and successful economy. This Government will not let the people of Wales down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, could I ask hon. Members to ensure that interventions are directly related to the point at issue and are not mini-speeches? That would help to keep the debate going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As an ex post facto point, I presume that we are permitted to take our jackets off, Mr. Griffiths. If not, it would be too late for me—but I can always put it back on. I am flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State did not comment on the problem of the gross domestic product of Wales having fallen yet further in the past three or four years. It is an indictment not only of this Government but of previous Governments that the relative position of Wales has deteriorated significantly over the past five to seven years. As we all know, large parts of Wales have objective 1 status. We are pleased about that. As we said earlier, it is not a panacea for all ills, but it is a useful tool which, if used properly, will make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have shown that they recognise that by allocating increases in the block grants to the Assembly over and above those indicated by the Barnett formula. The additional £486 million for 2001–04 is welcome; it will cover grants from the European Union for approved projects in Wales that form part of the objective 1, 2 and 3 programmes and other Community initiatives. This is the first time that Wales will have received from the Treasury the funds earmarked for it by the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a significant and welcome change, due in large part to pressure exerted across the political spectrum by the National Assembly. However, not a single penny has been added to the block grant as a United Kingdom contribution to the match funding that is required under Community rules. We estimate that about £340 million of match funding will be needed from 2001–04, all of which will have to be found by the National Assembly, presumably by raiding the health and education budgets highlighted at the election. There must be a change in emphasis, and I hope the Secretary of State will take note of what I said earlier. If our colleagues in the National Assembly, whatever their political persuasion, are to do their best they must have the appropriate finance to do so.

We are disappointed that there was no mention in the Queen's Speech of the regional imbalances in the UK economy. In an interesting speech, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry mentioned the difference between the north-east, the south-east,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Wales and other parts of the country. He said clearly that there are huge regional imbalances. It should not be beyond the ken of the Government to address those imbalances, which do exist; we in Wales have seen good examples of what happens because of regional imbalances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the right hon. Gentleman's reply to my earlier question and I hope that he will push the issue, because we are lagging behind when we should be moving forward, especially with the advent of objective 1 and other initiatives in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government rightly place great emphasis on improving productivity. The Chancellor recently declared:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From today our energies must be directed to productivity."</p></blockquote>
In Labour's first term, productivity growth fell back rather than improving. Britain has an even bigger productivity gap after Labour's first four years; output per worker in the United States is 40 per cent, higher, and in France it is 20 per cent, higher, than in this country. An important reason for the productivity gap is that Britain's workers have less capital equipment. During the late 1990s, capital spending by business was robust, but it was offset by low Government investment. During Labour's first four years in office, net investment by the public sector as a proportion of gross domestic product was the lowest since the war. The one clear result is a dramatic worsening in an already overstretched transport system. The rhetoric we have heard today is more impressive than the action taken; adequate public transport and other services would make a far greater contribution to economic performance than tinkering with taper relief on capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for competition policy, Plaid Cymru welcomes the Government's intention to strengthen competition policy and, when possible, to remove politicians from the decision-making process in determining individual cases. There is a recognition that if the workings of the market are left to business interests, there will be a tendency to Monopoly and abuse of competition. The United States has long recognised that a strong, competitive market requires equally strong anti-trust legislation. We hope to scrutinise the proposed measures when they are presented to ensure that they are both strong and transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has made bold claims that there will be no return to boom and bust while Labour remains in power. That ignores the fact that there has already been boom and bust. For the first three years of Labour's first term, there was bust in the public sector, the effects of which are increasingly apparent in the failure to deliver quality public services. The right hon. Gentleman made the point that the Government will deliver their promises. We will see over the coming years whether that is right. For the sake of all our constituents, I sincerely hope that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comprehensive spending review now seeks to reverse the trend by increasing public expenditure rapidly in real terms over the next three years. The apparent stop-go approach, however, is not conducive to the effective and efficient management of the public sector. At the end of the three-year period covered by
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the CSR, the Government will be faced with the choice of cutting back on public spending increases or increasing taxation. Plaid Cymru believes that people earning more than £50,000 should be taxed at a higher rate—a progressive view of the taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not realise that the huge increase in public spending in Wales could not have been made without good management of the economy? By not spending Money on unemployment benefit or to meet interest on debt, we have been able to invest in the public sector. Management of the economy was essential before increased public spending in Wales could be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely on message, as those words have been used at least seven times by the Prime Minister since Christmas [Hon. Members: "It is true."] I am coming on to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me share an experience with other members of the Committee. When I was on the stump during the general election campaign, people did not rush up to say how wonderful the local hospital was, how good it was to see extra buses on the roads or that their little Johnny was in a class of 12. On the contrary, I had complaints, complaints and more complaints. I understand that the budget is always finite and that substantial increases have been made, but those increases followed substantial decreases that resulted from following Tory spending plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish the point. Money may well have been invested, but there is precious little evidence of it so far on the ground. As the Secretary of State says, delivery is the key, so I hope that it happens, particularly in respect of health, education and transport—for the sake of all our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome Plaid Cymru's recognition that the budget is finite. Will the hon. Gentleman admit that the lack of a properly costed budget in the general election was a big mistake for Plaid Cymru? It made them look foolish and they suffered for that lack of seriousness by gaining a poor result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman, who is obviously still in election mode. After bashing away at the Liberal Democrats, he is now having a bash at Plaid. In Wales the Labour vote went down by 220,000; the Tories' vote by 20,000 and the Liberal Democrats' by 10,000. Our vote went up by 14,000—that is how bad the election was for us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Returning to the hon. Gentleman's previous point, is he saying that people are critical of the Government not because everything that they did was wrong, but because various strategies were adopted since 1997 and the fundamental problems that we all know exist in health and education could have been tackled more effectively if the Government had been a little braver with taxation and more radical with their solutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly right; I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Increases in spending should have been made earlier. It is all very well for the Government to say that they had to stick to Tory spending plans. They stuck to them in order to gain power, they rigidly adhered to them for more than two years, and now we are paying the price for it. I hope that we will see substantial change, which is in everybody's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the old mantra of boom and bust, let me quote from the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 21 June this year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary policy committee neatly summarises the difficulties. The MPC's is a tale of two economies. Consumers are feeling prosperous. House prices are rising and retail spending is robust. But boom in the personal sector sits alongside bust in the tradable goods sector. The strength of sterling against the euro is crippling. Manufacturing output fell by 0.9 per cent, in April and the sector is set to fall into recession. Reflecting this, the UK registered its largest ever deficit."</p></blockquote>
The Government have had a good run of economic management over their first term. Only a fool would deny that. Good luck to them, but the second term may well be more testing. The United States is experiencing a major economic slowdown. Germany is facing recession. The stock markets around the world are in retreat and here in the UK the outlook for growth is deteriorating. The Government's spending plans under the comprehensive spending review are predicated on growth of 2.25 per cent, a year, and even then the public finances move into deficit in 2002–03. In the past the Chancellor has relied on actual growth exceeding his projections to ensure that public finances have a healthier outcome than planned. I hope that his plans are correct and that we are not caught up in any problem caused by other economies, but it is likely that the trick will no longer work with actual growth at a lower rate than planned. The Government would then face the choice of raising taxes, borrowing more or cutting public spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Plaid Cymru spokesman, would the hon. Gentleman like to take this opportunity to explain to the Committee something that before the election, the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) promised would be made clear after the election? If Plaid Cymru's policies were followed, how would it make up for the black hole of spending in Wales, compared with taxes raised in Wales? It appears to me that its policies would result in either a 30 per cent, cut in services or a 50 per cent, increase in taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what my hon. Friend said. I hope that he will catch your eye, Mr. Griffiths. He will undoubtedly handle himself as well as anyone in this Committee, and probably better than I shall. I do not know about any black hole, although I know that the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Denzil Davies), who typically is not here today, bangs on about one. According to him, we all have to be on our knees and tied to the British establishment for ever and a day. That is a typical Unionist outlook and not very sustainable. It does not make a great deal of sense either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he did not recognise a black hole, but he talked about progressive taxation and a 50 per cent, increase for those earning above £100,000. How much would that raise per annum and what would it be spent on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would raise £5.7 billion, which would obviously be spent on public services. [Hon. Members: "In Wales alone?"] No, that would be half the budget of the National Assembly. Those are UK figures; Welsh figures cannot be separated from UK figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agricultural sector is vital to the economic development and the sustainability of our rural communities. It is in the grip of the worst crisis for generations. It has been hit by disasters such as BSE, and more recently foot and mouth. Agriculture, although on its knees, is still resilient, but it has to battle against an unfavourable exchange rate and is unable to export stock. Moreover, it has not received the full value of its subsidies because of the pound-euro exchange rate. We should not lose sight of the fact that even before the foot and mouth crisis, 73 farming jobs were being lost each week. That is the equivalent of a major factory closing each year. Average incomes from farming activity in the UK were recently assessed at £4,500. The average for upland farmers, who account for 80 per cent, of Welsh farmers, was even worse at £3,800. I dread to see the figures once the full impact of foot and mouth has been felt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must realise that agriculture is not an isolated industry, but one that encompasses the whole rural economy. Its problems affect other rural businesses and can trigger a downturn in the rural economy, which, I am afraid, we are seeing in many areas of Wales. I hope that Ministers will consider proper and consequential compensation for both farmers and others who operate rural businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agricultural sector is vital, and we must protect it at all costs. Plaid Cymru's view is that farming must be supported and succeed in the framework of an integrated rural development policy. Elements such as renewable energy, sustainable forestry, cultural heritage tourism and other forms of diversification should be central in such a policy. We need a real and non-political debate about the topic, because we are all concerned. We should get together, forget political differences and discuss the points. As we speak here in Westminster, the situation in rural Wales is desperate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru calls for alternative indicators in addition to gross domestic product, such as the index of sustainable economic welfare, as tools to measure the contribution of the sector to the Welsh economy. Such indicators would give a far better reflection of that contribution. The Agriculture and Rural Development Committee in the National Assembly recently recommended the implementation of a young entrants scheme. The Farmers Union of Wales wants to introduce an early retirement scheme for older farmers, linked to a new entrants scheme to encourage young people to become farmers. Such schemes exist in many European Union states but the Government have refused to implement one in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman point out to members of the fanning unions that the quota system makes it extremely difficult for young farmers to come in and, to the Farmers Union of Wales in particular, that adherence to the quota system is counterproductive to its aim of getting young farmers to enter the industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I hear the hon. Gentleman. His is a fair point, and last year I visited the EU official who dealt with the new sheep quota regime to make that point, because it impacts heavily on us in Wales, with 25 per cent, of the sheep flock affected. More importantly, the hon. Gentleman is right about the specific point that it makes life difficult, if not impossible, for young entrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to an early retirement scheme linked to young entrants. A recent fact-finding visit by the farming unions to Ireland discovered that 10,000 farmers had taken advantage of the scheme there, which reduced the average age of fanners from 57 to 50. We should do everything that we can to help young people stay in farming, and we were disappointed that there was no reference to that in the Queen's Speech. There should have been, because the problem is not simply in rural Wales; it is a UK-wide problem. We are disappointed that there was no mention of rural problems or answers for rural businesses, in particular the farming sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that I repeatedly raised that point in the Agriculture Committee in the previous Parliament. Is he aware that the Minister has consistently given all kinds of reasons why we could not implement the scheme? That seems to fly in the face of reason, given the fact that many of our European colleagues have done exactly what the hon. Gentleman and the Liberal Democrats have called for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reinforces the point. However, when we discuss the scheme—and, hopefully, implement it, we should not predicate it on linking farms, because that would make rural depopulation worse. The point has been made, and I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe affects every business, in particular the agriculture industry in Wales. In the coming Months and years, I hope that there will be a definite steer from Government on the subject, because the lack of that is having a detrimental effect. Companies such as Ford have made it clear that they are staying and continuing to invest only because they presume that the United Kingdom will adopt the euro within the next few years. I hope that when the time comes we have a mature and sensible debate, led not by politicians but by academics and economists who are knowledgeable about such matters. There should not simply be a political debate. [HON. MEMBERS: "That is worse."] Perhaps it is bad, but I do not see how it could be worse than a political debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to agriculture, the tourist industry is in a crisis because of the impact of foot and mouth and the problem of the euro. Tourism is the largest industry in Wales; about 100,000 are employed
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
directly and 25,000 indirectly in the tourist industry, which is far larger than any other industry in Wales. Spending by overnight and day visitors to Wales contributes about £2 billion directly to the Welsh economy, which is equivalent to about 7 per cent, of gross domestic project. Tourism is a major industry and I hope that once the impact of foot and mouth has passed we can concentrate our efforts on improving the tourism industry in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the visit to the United States by the Welsh Affairs Committee, many members of which are in the Committee. We saw that much work needs to be done in the United States to put Wales firmly on the map. We are well behind our partners in the rest of the United Kingdom in that respect, although there is some improvement in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, tourism in Wales is in a bad way. Rural tourism losses in February and March were about £5.6 million a week, rising to £15 million in April and to £18.7 million in May. The income of many tourist businesses is down by about 75 to 85 per cent. Some of those operators are farmers who diversified; they have gone from the frying pan into the fire. I hope that we can concentrate on that sector in the coming Months and years, for the good of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech was disappointing for Wales. During the election campaign, the Prime Minister said that new Labour would have to be far more radical this time. What is in the Queen's Speech is not a radical agenda for the future of Wales; despite a further pledge on the commitment to devolution, there are no developments apart from those referred to by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wayne David 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Gentleman has not yet concluded his speech, but he has not referred to education and public-private partnerships. We heard earlier that the leader of Caerphilly county borough council, Lindsey Whittle, a Plaid Cymru member, is a firm advocate of public-private partnerships in education. Does the hon. Gentleman support or condemn him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was at the launch of that PFI project, unlike the hon. Gentleman, who should have been there. The project involves only the building of two schools—that is the top and bottom of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Griffiths. The hon. Gentleman referred to an event in my constituency to which I was not invited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there we are! I found myself there. I must put the record straight: that project, a PFI initiative, involved the building of two new schools, one Welsh-medium school and one English-medium school. People said, "If we don't do it this way, we will never have a new school." The hon. Gentleman appears to be saying that I am at sea in some way, but my point is about sponsorship; it is the McDonald's idea that I am concerned about, and the Coca-Cola and Mars companies moving into schools. I cannot think of anyone else who would want to move in and have a say. That is undoubtedly what is at the back of the Cabinet's mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We won our historic victory a few weeks ago and Labour achieved a second full term for the first time because the electors of Wales understood our programme. The choice was clear. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister noted in debate on the Queen's Speech that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the British people decisively rejected the narrow nationalism and Monomania of the Conservative party on Europe."—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 20 June 2001; Vol. 370, c. 55.]</p></blockquote>
Indeed they did, and my constituents endorsed that view with a further swing of 3.66 per cent, away from the Conservatives to me and the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents and others throughout north Wales also rejected the narrow nationalism represented by the Welsh National party, Plaid Cymru. I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the achievement of my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen), who regained the island of Anglesey after 22 years in the clutches first of the Conservatives and then the nationalists. I am pleased that my hon. Friend is here today. We have been friends for years, and I know his strong feelings for and knowledge of his constituents. He follows in the footsteps of such eminent Labour Members as the late Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos and the late Lady Megan Lloyd George. I have no doubt that a Labour Member representing the interests of Ynys Môn again will greatly add to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The priorities in the Queen's Speech are clear. Reform of public services in health, education, crime, enterprise and welfare is the key priority. I shall concentrate today on entrepreneurship and draw to the Committee's attention the pioneering work of the university of Wales, Bangor and its partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members will know that Bangor gained its Coleg ar y Bryn in the 19th century thanks to pennies collected through the chapels and house to house. Now it is a constituent college of the university of Wales and enjoys worldwide fame for its academic excellence. The university's mission is not only to maintain and develop that role in the international academic community, but to create and nurture a strong partnership with its regional community. The international academic standing that attracts world-leading researchers to Bangor benefits our local community and the economy of Wales. It informs high-quality student teaching and feeds through to the region's benefit in widening access to higher education and economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two examples of the university's contribution to the widening-access agenda are particularly relevant. First, the talent identification programme starts with
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
pupils in year 9 in selected local schools. The university works with pupils identified by their teachers as having the ability to benefit from a university education but who, because of family background, are unlikely even to think of applying to go to university. The university works with them to boost their self-esteem and confidence, raise their ambitions and show them that university education could be for them. The programme has grown from a small start in 1998 and will next year involve more than 1,000 students from eight local schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second highly significant development is the community university of North Wales. It brings university at Bangor into a close partnership with the North East Wales institute of higher education in Wrexham and the nine colleges of further education in north Wales, including Coleg Menai, based in Bangor in my constituency. The aim is simply to provide new opportunities for flexible part-time study for those in the region who, for whatever reason—geography, family, finance—have not had the opportunity to develop their full educational potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Saturday, I attended the launch in Bangor of a new part-time bachelor of arts degree in internet learning and organisations. The course recognises the crucial place of internet technology in business and other organisations. It is a distance-learning course that is substantially delivered through the internet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The university at Bangor is already contributing to economic development, and I should like to mention two excellent examples. The first is the teaching company schemes. By now, it is generally accepted that one of the most effective ways of transferring research knowledge from a university to business and industry is through TCS partnerships, sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. In such a partnership, the university and the company work closely together on a development project that is of particular commercial interest to the company. I was present when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Margaret Beckett) visited the university for the recent signing of the 50th TCS partnership agreement. The network of partners now spreads over the whole of north Wales and beyond, and I believe that only two other universities in the United Kingdom have more partnerships than Bangor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the university is responding to the challenge of the European objective 1 initiative, which brings to the region many new opportunities for genuine and fundamental change to the economy. The university intends to provide all the support that it can and is involved in working up some 25 projects with various local partners. Early in the university's response was the establishment of the Centre for Enterprise and Regional Development under the leadership of Professor Dylan Jones-Evans. With objective 1 support, the centre is introducing e-MBAs to make management training available electronically to people working in small and medium enterprises so that it is not necessary for them to take time off work to attend courses. The training will include tourism, leisure, hospitality and heritage management, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
are important areas of employment in our local economy that are currently short of management skills. The centre will also concentrate on developing entrepreneurial skills in the region. In parallel, a new initiative in the university is designed to raise awareness of entrepreneurial career opportunities among students and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the support of the Welsh Development Agency, the university established new chairs in computer science and opto-electronic materials chemistry. The two new professors, Ken Hawick and Stuart Irvine, are now leading the development of two major bids for objective 1 funding to establish centres for advanced software technology and for optoelectronic materials. Both centres will have a huge impact on the regional economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have highlighted some of the work that is carried out at my local university in support of an entrepreneurial economy. The university is highly successful and recognised throughout the UK and beyond, and I am very proud of its achievements. Our ancestors who contributed their pennies more than 100 years ago invested wisely, and we should not forget that. The work in Bangor now goes hand in hand with Government plans for lifelong learning and entrepreneurship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, success in the region is marred by the occasional employer whose industrial relations practices have not changed since the start of the previous century. People in my constituency still talk about the tyranny experienced by their families at the hands of Lord Penrhyn. I am sorry to say that a company near Caernarfon today actively pursues similar practices. Friction Dynamics Ltd. is located in the Caernarfon constituency but affects many of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my hon. Friends to support early-day motion 40, which was tabled last week. The motion deplores the attitude and behaviour of the employer in the dispute at Friction Dynamics Ltd. in demanding, without negotiation, that the workers accept a change in their working conditions and take a cut of 15 per cent, in their pay, which has already been frozen for four years. It also rejects the employers' negative attitude to discussions with workers' representatives, held under the auspices of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, and their most recent move to dismiss the workers involved in the legitimate dispute. It applauds the workers' reasonable attitude and their determination to pursue a just settlement, and calls on the employers to withdraw the dismissal notices and enter into meaningful negotiations forthwith. Such attitudes and behaviour on the part of employers is not acceptable to any reasonable person in this day and age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The strike at Friction Dynamics Ltd. is about not a demand for increased pay but an enforced 15 per cent, reduction in pay and an enforced change in working conditions. The workers have been out on strike for nine weeks and have in the past two weeks received dismissal notices—sent out when the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
owner of the factory, Mr. Smith, had left for the United States to attend to other business interests. I ask members of the Committee to add their name to my early-day motion so that we can be sure that the employer returns to meaningful discussions, under the auspices of ACAS, rather than pursuing his current line of behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for repeating what I said. I reiterate that I urge my hon. Friends to consider signing the early-day motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's agenda is about maintaining progress towards full employment. We wish to help business and enterprise flourish. Companies such as Friction Dynamics Ltd. will do so only if it changes and recognises that employees are assets to be cherished and not chattels to be abused at will. I look forward to the vigorous pursuance of Government policies on both sides of the House so that we can all enjoy the benefit of long-term social development, harMony and prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Griffiths. It is right that the Committee should meet early in this Parliament and that we should discuss the Queen's Speech as it affects Wales. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) on his appointment as a Minister. We look forward to his winding-up speech. He and I have something in common: we have both stood in Neil Kinnock's former constituency, I in Bedwelty and he in Islwyn. He was marginally more successful, but he had the advantage that Neil Kinnock stood aside to enable him to secure election.

The Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) have referred to Conservative support in Wales at the general election which, at 21 per cent., was up by 1.5 per cent.—one and a half times greater than the increase in support for the Liberal Democrats or Plaid Cymru. I remind hon. Members that the 288,000 Conservative votes in Wales represent something like 43 per cent, of the vote secured by the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Unfortunately, Labour won 34 seats and we won none—that is representative democracy, and I do not advocate any change in the electoral system. It is also the same representative democracy under which my Liberal Democrat opponent had licence to question my ability, having been born in Wales, to represent my constituents. That is the kind of racist comment that we tend to associate with the other minor party in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I will look into the point that he made, although he has not asked me to, because it is not the sort of politics that we should pursue. In the interests of clarity, is he making the point about the percentage increase in his party's vote because he feels that the Conservatives were done an injustice in Wales in getting no seats? If not, can I have his assurance that henceforth the Conservative party will accept with good grace its absence from Welsh parliamentary politics on the basis that under the current system it is perfectly clear that the Welsh people do not want to allow Conservative Members to return to Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not accept the extension of the argument that the hon. Gentleman has made.

I want to speak about the Queen's Speech and most particularly the one Bill that relates specifically to Wales. The Minister told us that the Bill to reform the national health service in Wales would be presented in draft form initially. It nevertheless gives the people of Wales an opportunity to look at the failure of the NHS in Wales under both a Labour Government and a Labour Administration in Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Labour, the NHS in Wales is in crisis. The Minister for Health and Social Services in the National Assembly is guilty of gross incompetence in her handling of NHS funding. The NHS in Wales epitomises Labour's failure to deliver on its promise to the Welsh people. Labour promised to deliver a health service that was fit for the 21st century, but after four years in Government the number of Welsh patients waiting more than 12 Months for in-patient or day-case treatment has increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that it can take anything from 10 to 15 years to train a consultant, from five to seven years to train a GP and from four to five years to train a nurse? For those personnel to be in place now, the decisions would have to have been taken under a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the current Prime Minister who said that there were 24 hours to save the national health service, and that was four years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of Welsh patients waiting for their first out-patient appointment has increased. The number waiting more than three Months has increased by 232 per cent. The number waiting more than six Months has increased by 771 per cent. Despite Labour's promises, the only measure that has shown a fall since 1997 is the total number of people waiting for in-patient treatment. That has fallen by just 735 since March 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Month, the number of people waiting for either in-patient or out-patient appointments in Wales rose on every measure. The Minister for Health and Social Services, Jane Hutt, put the increase down to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
seasonal blip resulting from the Easter holidays and two bank holidays. She also revealed that she planned to send some orthopaedic patients across the border to have their operations in Cheltenham or Gloucester. Her failure to meet her annual target of reducing the numbers by 15,000—she was 4,000 adrift—while those waiting for the first out-patient appointment rose by 8,000 instead of being reduced by half, led to a Conservative censure motion in the National Assembly in April. Unfortunately, that failed after being opposed by Labour's Assembly allies, Rhodri's little helpers, the Liberal Democrats, and Labour has decided to drop its waiting list initiative in favour of concentrating on waiting times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour pledged to invest £12 million in orthopaedic care to ensure that no one should have to wait more than 18 Months in pain for orthopaedic treatment by July 2002. Let us remind ourselves that Labour promised to improve the operation of the NHS in Wales. In the 1997 general election, one of its early pledges was to cut waiting lists as a first step—it was on Labour's famous pledge card. Two years later, in February 1999, the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), who is now in Westminster Hall sorting out the English countryside, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We promised to bring down NHS waiting lists and to tackle underfunding. We have made a start, and we will fulfil our pledge"—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 25 February 1999; Vol. 344, c. 542.]</p></blockquote>
He also told the House that his aim was to re-establish the NHS as a dependable service that provides care when it is needed. He described the NHS in Wales as Labour's pride and joy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all that, Labour's record on the NHS in the past four years has been lamentable. The latest hospital waiting list figures for the period to the end of May 2001 were published on 27 June. They revealed that in May the number of people waiting for inpatient and day-case treatment rose by 500—an increase on the Month of 0.8 per cent. Of those, the number waiting more than 12 Months rose by 193, and the number waiting more than 18 Months by 170—an increase of 4.3 per cent. The situation for out-patients was even worse: the number waiting rose by 6,700, an increase of 3.7 per cent., and the number waiting more than six Months rose by 2,024, an increase of 6.2 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) asked the hon. Gentleman how long it takes to train a nurse, a doctor, a general practitioner and a consultant. The hon. Gentleman gave us a list of statistics. Will he remind the Committee of the situation in May 1997, when the Labour Government took office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to relate the current figures to the figures for May 1997. I shall also relate the performance of the national health service in Wales to the performance of the NHS in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I presume the hon. Lady was about to point out, Labour's record is even more shocking when the latest figures are compared with 1997. For in-patient and day-case treatments, the number waiting overall has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
fallen by 735 since March 1997, but the number waiting more than 12 Months has increased by 2,822. On the in-patient and day-case list, 13.6 per cent, of patients have been waiting longer than 12 Months for treatment, compared with less than 10 per cent, when Labour took office in 1997. Similarly, the number waiting more than 18 Months has risen by 2,761 to 4,163. Those are absolute increases over the four-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine out-patient figures, we can see how Labour's failed waiting list initiative has distorted clinical priorities and resulted in a huge increase in the number of people waiting to get on the official waiting list. There is now a waiting list to go on to the waiting list for the waiting list. Despite the fact that Labour has now dropped its commitment to the initiative, the effects of the policy remain all too evident. The number of Welsh patients waiting for a first out-patient appointment has increased since March 1997 by 87,118—an increase of 86 per cent, to a total of 188,426. Of those, 94,334 have been waiting more than three Months—an increase of 232 per cent, since 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the number waiting longer than six Months is truly staggering, as 51,887 people have been waiting more than six Months for their first out-patient appointment, as compared with just 5,956 in March 1997—an increase of 45,931, which is 771 per cent. That figure represents 29.5 per cent, of the entire waiting list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt such an interesting list of statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will all be in the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that they will. Will the hon. Gentleman add to the record by telling us how much longer the waiting list would have been if his party's £20 billion of cuts had been made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my party did not have a £20 billion list of cuts and as none of the £8 billion that appeared in our manifesto affected the national health service, it would have made no difference. If we were responsible for day-to-day management of the NHS, our proposals for its management would make a positive impact on the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman therefore claim that the problems to which he rightly draws our attention can be solved without a substantial increase in spending on the health service? If he believes that there should be such an increase, how would the Conservative party fund it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's presumption that simply throwing more taxpayers' Money at it can solve the problem—nor is that the Government's contention. During the general election the Conservative party's consistent position was to spend the Money more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing illustrates the failure in Wales more clearly than the fact that more than 4,000 people have been waiting more than 18 Months for their operation, whereas the Government's figure for England is just 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
The NHS in Wales also suffers from serious staff shortages. It suffers problems of morale and funding. According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are 750 vacant nursing posts in Wales and another 2,000 are needed for the NHS to cope. The NHS in Wales does not enjoy the same benefits as the NHS in England. The NHS plan in England set a target for recruiting 200,000 nurses, while the equivalent plan in Wales set no target at all. Similarly, the £4 million spent by the Government on advertising for recruitment in England has not been extended to Wales, despite the crisis in recruitment. NHS Cymru has started recruiting nurses from overseas to fill the gap in the service. That practice, although useful, does not provide a long-term solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he means by recruitment? The advertising programme was designed to recruit people into training whereas recruitment to hospitals is a post-training matter. There is no difficulty in recruiting people to training in Wales, but that is different from recruiting people who have already been trained. There is a shortage of trained people, largely as a result of the under-investment in training that occurred during the hon. Gentleman's party's period in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is retention, and I acknowledge that that dates back some time. However, the Government have had four years to address retention of nurses and have failed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of recruiting nurses from overseas, Mr. Richard Jones of the Royal College of Nursing recently said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The recruitment of staff from overseas on the current scale is only a short-term solution. The long-term answer is to ensure that we train and recruit enough nurses to cope with the demands and make the NHS a place where nurses want to work, rather than a place, as at present, that many want to leave."</p></blockquote>
I do not want to consider the alternative offered by the Conservatives at the general election because that was well rehearsed during the campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has discussed at length aspects of health policy in Wales but he has not mentioned primary health care. Is he aware that the drift of policy in the Assembly is to try to move resources to the primary level? That will prevent waiting lists from building up, and it is one of the great beauties of what is happening in the National Assembly. That will take time—it is like turning a tanker around—but the hon. Gentleman has not mentioned any of those issues in his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that; I want to talk about some of the proposals that the Conservative group has made in the National Assembly, some of which relate to primary health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative group in the National Assembly has pledged to restore spending on the NHS capital programme in Wales to £100 million a year—its level under the previous Conservative Government. One of the group's first priorities would be to construct Wales's first dedicated children's hospital at an estimated cost of £25 million—somewhat less than the cost of the new National Assembly building. Welsh
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Conservatives would offer local health groups the option of taking on trust status, and would encourage them to do so. That would improve the way in which the NHS is organised and operates at a primary level in local Welsh areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would also favour the establishment of an Assembly-supported exceptional medicines fund to ensure that the necessary treatments, such as beta interferon, are always available to Welsh patients who require them. We would also seek the establishment of at least three special surgical units to deal with waiting-list backlogs in north, west and south Wales. In order to reduce waiting times, those units would be dedicated to providing planned operations, rather than being used for emergency treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to my conclusion, and the hon. Lady may have an opportunity to address my remarks in her own speech. To reduce the problems of bed blocking, we would make greater use of the independent sector for patients who require care but have nowhere to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Wales deserve better. In deliberations on the forthcoming Bill, we will seek to ensure that the national health service in Wales delivers better for all the people of Wales. Labour's record over the past four years has been disastrous and appalling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I fall into the category of "oldies" to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State alluded, but for the past four years, I have found myself in an anomalous and frustrating situation. I was elected as Member of Parliament for Newport, East for the first time in 1997, and I was privileged to receive a Government appointment. As it was, however, in a capacity that confined my responsibilities to England, I could not take part in proceedings on Welsh matters as much as I—as a representative of a Welsh constituency—would have wished. I am grateful to you, Mr. Griffiths, for calling me, and am glad to take part for the first time in the Welsh Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State stressed that devolution has not made any less important the role of hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies in this Parliament. We all agree with that. It is excellent that the office of Secretary of State for Wales still exists. Parliament passes primary legislation and creates the fiscal framework, which allows those who are elected to the Assembly, or to local government, to pursue their duties. It is important that the voice of Wales should be heard in debates held in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support devolution because I believe in extending and renewing our democracy through constitutional reform. The recent general election underscored the point that we have some way to go to achieve that. I am pleased that the Gracious Speech shows that the Government have maintained their commitment to
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Welsh devolution. It states that the Government will provide a regionally elected element in the House of Lords. That raises questions about the dynamics of devolution and the emergent constitutional settlement. Under what electoral system will such regional peers emerge? If the second Chamber is to be at the apex of our elected system of government, what will be its role and its working relationship with other elected bodies? We must analyse and debate such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should achieve a stable constitutional settlement as soon as we can. It is important that our constituents should understand the respective roles of Parliament, the Government, the Assembly and local authorities. That would assist those bodies to do their jobs. We need a more comprehensible division of labour, although the division will never be absolute as the different elected bodies will always compete for power and will always have a legitimate need to interact. The democratic institutions that serve Wales should learn an appropriate degree of co-operation, forbearance and mutual respect for each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fragile position of local government concerns me, and may be illustrated by Newport's predicament, which arises from the contemptuous and destructive decision taken by Corus to end the proud tradition of steelmaking in Llanwern and south-east Wales. I appreciate the support package that has been negotiated. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State played a crucial role in its achievement. Issues arise over the allocation of resources and whether the package is sufficient. In Newport, we in no way begrudge the lion's share, to use the words of the First Minister, of the resources available for regeneration in Gwent going to Ebbw Vale. The troubles in Ebbw Vale must deeply concern all of us. However, I must question whether the funding that may be available for my constituents will be sufficient once the vouchsafed amounts go to Ebbw Vale. I am immensely impatient for progress to occur so that we can start to use those resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if there has been insufficient time to prepare to address the calamity that has been created. Corus announced large-scale redundancies last summer. Many people expected that it would make further drastic decisions following the turn of the year. Therefore, there has been plenty of time to consider what all that may mean, and what the appropriate response of Government at different levels should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultants' activities are proliferating, but have not proceeded tremendously far. Of course, it is important that any decisions taken about the use of the resources to assist our constituents should be based on complete information and a clear analysis of the needs and options for constructive response. We must ensure that that does not take undue time. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Ministers will do their best to ensure that decisions are taken so that we can begin to use the resources quickly. Demoralisation is liable to deepen, and economic opportunity may be lost every week and Month that we have to wait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman talked about the use of resources. Does he agree that the key question is which resources are available for use? Does he share my concern at the National Assembly underspend of, for example, £50 million on health last year? An Assembly spokesman acknowledged that some of that was set aside to compensate for job losses in Wales, such as those at Corus. It undermines the general and financial relationship between Westminster and the National Assembly if, once again, the Assembly must set aside part of its core spending to meet what the right hon. Gentleman now says should have been foreseen, but which certainly was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the right hon. Gentleman also agree that central Government are providing insufficient funding to enable the Assembly to distribute resources to the communities that he wants to protect, and that we need to look again at the relationship between Westminster and the Welsh Cabinet on how extra spending is made available for Wales when crises arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All in all, substantial additional resources have been made available. The reform that the Government introduced in the previous Parliament was sensible, as it allowed budgeting on a longer cycle than had traditionally been so when handling public expenditure. We should not be slavishly concerned about spending everything before 31 March. However, I do agree that there should be no undue delay in finding appropriate ways to use the additional resources that the Government have provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that a large proportion of people who are not directly involved in politics in Wales genuinely feel that underinvestment in health and education is continuing in spite of the increases that he rightly says his party has, to some extent, introduced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for the Vale of Clwyd made the powerful point earlier that the lead times for effective use of public investment, especially in the health service, are lengthy. There is impatience, but significant additional resources are already in the system and they will work through to yield beneficial results. During the election campaign, my experience was that most people understood and accepted that. Although, of course, they asked what had happened to delivery, they realised and acknowledged that the direction that had been set was right, and they knew that further resources would be coming through. For that reason, among many others, they chose to return a Labour Government with a large majority of parliamentary seats in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech tells us that the Government's central objectives are economic stability, and investment and reform in the public services, which will lead to a more prosperous and inclusive society. I imagine that Conservative Members, along with the rest of us, would say amen to that. I want to talk about both economic policy and policy for public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has achieved financial stability and a prospect of sustained economic growth that had eluded all Chancellors and Governments for as long as any of us can remember. He deserves praise, as does the Governor of the Bank of England. Neither of them will forfeit precious stability and the prospect of sustainable growth. However, the specific decisions that they must take are by no means easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom, we have at least a two-speed economy—a variable speed economy. This morning, we noted the news that engineering businesses are desperate for interest rate reductions and a weaker pound. Simultaneously, we heard that house prices are rising and are expected to continue to rise faster than previously projected. That conjunction alone vividly illustrates the enormous technical difficulty of taking the decisions necessary for the management of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents call on the Government to engineer a reduction in the value of the pound. They are less clear, as are hon. Members who have echoed that call, about how the Chancellor can achieve that responsibly in the near future or even the medium term. Corus complained that it had had no option but to dismantle the steel industry in Wales on account of the level of the pound, particularly against the euro. That is something of an alibi, as manufacturing exports in the UK rose last year. Corus was magnificently served by its own employees, who achieved remarkable productivity and competitiveness. There was no reason why a company with Corus's depth of resources and strength should not have been able to weather those difficult financial conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Calls for lower interest rates and a drastic devaluation of the pound to enable us to move quickly into membership of the single currency are dangerously seductive, but inflationary consequences would result from trying to go down that path, at least at any speed. That could put in peril everything that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor and the Government have achieved so far in their stewardship of the economy, and it would jeopardise in particular the progress that we want to make in public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is difficult to judge the appropriate interest rate for the United Kingdom, how much more difficult is it for the European Central Bank to judge the appropriate rate for the continent of Europe, given that the European Union bids fair to embrace enlargement? On behalf of my constituents in southeast Wales, I would be fearful if new arrangements meant that there had to be a single interest rate for the enormously diverse economies of Europe. We should perhaps pursue that debate another day, but let us have a snippet of it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only a snippet, but it affects the whole of Wales.

	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
Public services, even those that are more or less devolved, operate in a context created by the policies of the United Kingdom Government and are bound to take account of the precedents and models created elsewhere in the UK. I sometimes experience frustration and impatience because, under devolution, my constituents must often wait longer than I would wish for the benefits of Government policy to reach them. Our friends and colleagues in the Assembly need to move with maximum alacrity—a point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik)— to use the resources and pick up, should they wish to, the initiatives offered by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech offered the prospect of a national health service Bill for Wales. As it will be a draft Bill, we will have an opportunity—either here or in the Assembly in Cardiff—to think carefully about how public services, and especially health services, should be delivered in modern circumstances. During the general election campaign, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made an interesting and important speech in Gravesend in which he said, with regard to public services, that it would be the policy of a Labour Government in their second term to "Devolve. Diversify. Deregulate." The Prime Minister also spoke of the need for partnership and for investment to be matched by reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who believes in the importance of public services must welcome the prospect of reform. All of us who believe that the health service is precious and that education is of fundamental importance know that we have a duty not to be hidebound, simply sticking to antique formulas and methods, but to ensure that services are delivered to the highest possible standard.
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
If that should lead to an alteration in the means of delivery, we must be prepared to contemplate it and we must certainly be prepared to examine it positively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There need be no immediate panic at the suggestion that the private sector could have greater involvement in the delivery of public services; nor should that proposition be condemned. There has been a bit of a kerfuffle in the three weeks or so since the election on that general topic, and there is understandable anxiety on the part of those who work in the public services and a need to know where they stand. We need more clarification about what precisely my right hon. Friends and other Ministers have in mind. Our debate on the draft NHS (Wales) Bill will provide us with an opportunity to think about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is surely beyond reasonable contention— although the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) differed on the point—is that the additional investment needed for the public services is huge, partly because we have experienced decades of institutional Treasury hostility to the public services, which at times seemed like Treasury nihilism. That damage has been compounded by periodic Treasury mismanagement. How many of us can recall the Treasury actually getting it right at any of the important economic turning points between the end of the war and 1997? In the past four years, we have seen a remarkable improvement in the management of the economy. However, whether we consider the mid-1970s, the second half of the 1980s or the early 1990s, we can see that the Treasury took catastrophically ill-judged decisions on the overall conduct of the economy, with famous boom and bust consequences and too little investment in public services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>19.	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What his latest assessment is of the number of job losses in Gwent caused by reductions in activity announced by Corus in 2001. [2246]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Corus announced its job cuts on I February 2001, it estimated that 3,000 steel workers at its plants in Wales would be made redundant. From these figures 1,540 of those were to be made redundant at Llanwern, which finally closed
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
on 28 June, and 780 at Ebbw Vale phased over a period until its final closure in summer 2002. My thoughts are with those steel workers who have recently lost their jobs and are with those who are to lose their jobs in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no specific estimate yet produced of the number of indirect jobs lost as a result of Corus's decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, in partnership with the National Assembly for Wales, has already taken swift action to help support those made jobless by investing in training and skills; with a revised ISERBS scheme worth £2,500 for each worker made redundant; and by funding regeneration measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
