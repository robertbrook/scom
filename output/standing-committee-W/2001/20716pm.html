<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill</h1></div>
<p><i>Motion made and Question proposed [this day]</i>,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill.—[<i>Mr. Paul Murphy</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with many members of the Committee that this is an historic day. We are considering provisions before they come in the form of a Bill before Parliament. I welcome such a departure, especially given that, when Bills reach the Floor of the House, they are either timetabled or guillotined. The opportunity to debate measures is not as extensive as it used to be. It is important that the balance is redressed and that we are allowed to comment on a draft Bill. It has been scrutinised by the Welsh Affairs Committee, which has taken evidence on it, and its report is before us today. The process has been very useful. It is a pilot exercise and has the Prime Minister's support. In future, if measures deal exclusively with Wales, or if large chunks of proposals that relate to the United Kingdom as a whole would have an impact on Wales, perhaps the other place could be involved at an early stage. Several peers have expressed great interest in this Bill.<br><br>
I accept that the Bill is narrow, but it is important to consider it in a proper context. On page 11, the Select Committee report refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"<i>Wales</i> is retaining CHCs, with extended powers and responsibilities: <i>Scotland</i> has Health Councils, similar to CHCs but different: <i>England</i> will have Patients Forums, local authority scrutiny and separate advocacy services: Northern Ireland retains its network of regional Health and Social Services Councils … Such diversity offers ideal opportunities for discovering what works best where and why."</p></blockquote>
Well, I feel sorry for the poor patient who is perhaps trying to understand the structure of the health service and how it is organised, particularly when many Welsh patients are treated in England under a different system. When considering what works best and why, perhaps we could consider achieving best practice throughout the United Kingdom as opposed to only part of it. I do not think that any organisation in the country has gone through as many changes as the national health service. It has had more facelifts than Michael Jackson and, I suspect, to the same sad effect.<br><br>
The draft Bill will establish three new bodies, so we will have to get used to new acronyms, too. There will be 22 local health boards and other bodies that will be in position above them. We were told originally that such changes would be cost neutral, but the Welsh Assembly now says that they will cost between £12 million and £15 million. We must be cautious
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
when changes in bureaucracy cost that amount of money, because they must deliver results. We all want that to happen.<br><br>
The Bill will be judged by whether people receive better health service treatment. I have many press cuttings with me, but I shall not detain the Committee with details of them because we all know that there is a crisis within the national health service, not only in Wales, but throughout the entire United Kingdom. When headlines in <i>The Western Mail</i> say, "Why are they treating us this way?", "Medical schools running out of teachers", "Mid Wales villagers wait three years for a GP", "£30m worth of NHS buildings unsold" and "Shortages as dentists desert NHS over pay", we have a real problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman bandies about words such as "crisis", but will he also recognise the excellent work carried out in the NHS and the investment put in by the Government. Three or four years ago, one could not get a job as a radiographer in Morriston hospital for love nor money. In the past two years, five extra have been taken on—the hospital is crying out for them, and their recruitment continues. There may be demand in some areas, but does the hon. Gentleman recognise the great amount of good work that is going on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. Tribute has already been paid to the enormous commitment and dedication of our nurses, doctors and ancillary staff— everyone who helps our national health service to perform miracles on a daily basis. Of course I recognise that. At the same time, we would not be doing a service to the NHS and the people who work in it if we turned a blind eye to the real problems. Health service professionals tell me—as they probably also tell the hon. Gentleman—about the low morale that exists when they want to deliver a first-class service, but, for all sorts of reasons, they are unable to do so. A senior surgeon at the Royal Gwent hospital says that the problem with the NHS
<br><blockquote><p>"is the lack of everything—there are no surgeons, insufficient staff in training—there aren't the facilities for them to work in, there aren't the operating theatres, there aren't beds, there aren't enough anaesthetists, the whole of the Heath Service is in such a poor state."</p></blockquote>
Those comments are from somebody who works daily in the NHS, not me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ian Lucas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that substantial public investment is required to pay for each and every item of expenditure to which he referred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there must be substantial investment in the NHS, but I also recognise that more per head of the population is spent in the NHS in Scotland and Wales than in England, yet we have an inferior service. We must therefore find ways whereby the money is most efficiently and effectively spent. I am sure that the Secretary of State and the Minister would agree that we could announce billions of pounds of extra money, but we will have real problems if it is not spent efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how long he thinks that it takes to train a consultant in the NHS and when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
the consultants that we need today should have started their training?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt there is an ongoing process during which people come into and leave the profession. However, the hon. Gentleman's party has been in power for more than five years. He must recognise that they are scouring the world for nurses and doctors simply because they have not been able to get them in the United Kingdom. There is a problem with the retention of doctors in the NHS because morale is low. Let us begin to look for solutions whereby the substantial investment that is being made—which I recognise—will be effectively spent. If it were only a matter of money, there would be no problem with the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an interesting and wide-ranging discussion, but I should like the hon. Gentleman to relate it to the propositions in the Bill or those that he thinks are not there and should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you Mr. Griffiths. I knew that you would find what I had to say interesting. I wanted to describe the context of the problems, and the Bill that the Government believe is part of the solution.<br><br>
Like the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), I also wish to concentrate on the community health councils. I am rather sad that England has not retained them, because they are well respected in the main. I was interested to hear about the experiences of the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton) as a former member of a CHC. Several areas must be examined, primarily the independence of the CHCs. It is difficult to get people to serve on the CHCs. It is bad enough now, but what will it be like when the powers and responsibilities of CFCs are extended? Much more must be done to attract people to serve on those bodies. Their funding must also be examined. With current funding, they will simply not be able to take on wider responsibilities and do the job that they are doing at the moment.<br><br>
The training of CHC members will also be important. I do not know what training the hon. Member for Gower had before taking his position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Caton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not surprise me. I am not critical of him for having no training, but with the extra responsibility that is now involved, training must be considered to show members what to look for when they exercise their responsibility to scrutinise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unsure whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that when we held discussions in Cardiff bay with the professionals involved and the CHCs, they estimated that what the Welsh Assembly had put aside was just about right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I also read in the report that they wanted there to be more, so that it would be possible for them to perform fully all of their extra responsibilities. They say that what has been put aside is tight to the limit.<br><br>
This is a new role, and it will be necessary to suck it and see, so to speak, and to listen carefully to what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
those who are appointed to the position have to say when they start rolling out their new responsibilities. As has been mentioned, we would like them to get more involved in the prisons. Some people who are in prison have mental health problems; they are being detained, but they are not getting the proper psychiatric treatment that they deserve within the Prison Service, for all sorts of reasons, such as shortages. We must look carefully at the service that is being given in that area. If the CHCs are to be given these wider responsibilities, they should take on the responsibility of going into the prisons—and anywhere else where health care is being provided. I hope that the Government will listen to the suggestions that have come from their party and mine about the role of the CHCs.<br><br>
I come now to the CHCs' powers with regard to cross-border areas. Welsh people often have to travel to Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester for specialist treatment. If Welsh CHCs are to have a remit to investigate them, there must be clear lines so that everyone knows what their responsibilities are. In addition, there should not be too much duplication— or, possibly, more than duplication, particularly if Welsh patients are coming in from several different areas of Wales. We might give a CHCs' association some responsibility to go to other parts of the UK to check that standards are up to a particular level, but if we go down that route, I suspect that there will be a huge work load. In the initial period, the CHCs may only want to get involved if there are complaints, and I suspect that they would have to liaise with their English equivalents to try to ascertain information, because it would be worrying if Welsh CHCs and their English equivalents came out with contrary reports about the same hospitals. Therefore, they must form a relationship at an early stage.<br><br>
There is a recommendation that CHC members should be given time off work. I fully understand what the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) said this morning about the way that they would be compensated for the loss of pay. I also recognise that there is a problem in getting people on to such bodies in the first place, and that if people are in a profession where employers are not particularly interested in giving their employees time off, there will be a problem. On that point, I declare an interest, as I employee several people in Swansea. Again, I ask the Government to consult widely on this with the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors' small business sections, and other employer organisations, to find out what impact that would have.<br><br>
If this were to come about, exemptions for small businesses might be put in place, because this does not involve giving someone time off in a way that will always impose no cost on the employer: many firms employ only two or three people, and the person who is given time off might be critical to the well-being of that firm. That could cause real problems. In the future, the work load on CHC members will be high, so I ask the Government to consult widely before making a decision about that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0396">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
When we talked about the CHCs this morning, I intervened on the hon. Member for Cardiff, North to ask whether she would give them more power—more teeth—when they inspect some of these premises. She said that she would not, but that the publicity may be enough in itself. We will see about that, and I hope that she is right. However, many hospital buildings in the country are currently deficient—47 per cent, of them is the proportion that has been mentioned. If the CHCs say that that hospital is deficient, or that we need to see an improvement there, I hope that the structure for bringing up the level of service for the people in those hospitals will be sufficiently flexible and responsive. The CHCs will play an invaluable role in pointing out the areas where improvements can be made. We would need to ensure that their morale is kept as high as possible, and that they are doing a real job that we all value.<br><br>
CHCs had better get a move on if they are to go around care homes; there may not be any left by the time that they are given responsibility for them. They will be looking into care home provision for the most vulnerable people in the country. CHCs may well come forward with recommendations about the level of fees that local authorities are paying care homes. Although we are not giving CHCs the power to direct local authorities to increase the fees, I hope that they will consider the matter and decide whether there is a real crisis.<br><br>
Several homes in the private sector are closing simply because they cannot make a go of it, as there is a £30, £40 or £50 a head discrepancy between what the local authorities are giving them and what it costs to deliver that service. The service is expensive, but it is even more expensive not to provide it, as we know from what we said earlier about bed blocking. We need to release the beds in our hospitals. It is pointless to have elderly people who could be better looked after elsewhere clogging up beds in the NHS.<br><br>
The right to access to information has been mentioned, and is referred to time and again in the report. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. From what I can make out, it seems that the Government are fairly flexible on the matter, and that the current situation is an oversight that will be corrected. If we are to give extra powers to CHCs, which will champion the rights of patients, we must ensure that they have much publicity, so that the public know which is their CHC, who is involved in it and how to get in touch with them. That may have funding implications, but we must make sure that patients know their rights and how to communicate well with their CHCs. That is something that we desperately need to do.<br><br>
Morriston hospital has been mentioned. It is a wonderful hospital; there are no two ways about it. As the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) will know, the <i>South Wales Evening Post</i> is running a campaign to save the hospital's excellent paediatric neurology service, which has wonderful skilled staff. More than 74,500 people have signed a petition to prevent that service moving to Cardiff. All hon. Members present will know of the road problems in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
south Wales, and will know that Morriston hospital has a helipad, whereas Cardiff does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening closely to the argument. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that something should be added to the Bill to take account of that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the power of the CHCs. The front page of the <i>South Wales Evening Post</i> says that the consultation to save Morriston hospital was a sham because the consultation document was not even sent to the CHCs, which were supposed to get the consultation exercise under way across south Wales. If the CHCs are not being respected and are not taken seriously, we will have a real problem. The consultation exercise has been extended, but we must recognise the voice of people across Wales.<br><br>
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has said that no more than two hours should pass between something going wrong and service in that specialist field being provided. The Committee will know that it would take a lot longer for a patient from west Wales to get to a Cardiff hospital, whereas they could get to a Swansea hospital in that time. The CHCs must be taken more seriously in the extended consultation period. I had rather hoped that the voices of the 74,500 people who signed the petition would be considered, too. Let us also give due regard to the skilled staff working in that unit at Morriston hospital; we should ensure that they have the backing that they deserve.<br><br>
I want to say only one other thing about the Bill because I suspect that we will have plenty of time to comment as it goes through its legislative process. I have no views on how that will come about, but the Secretary of State's comments this morning suggest that the usual process will be used. In addition to examining carefully the Wales Centre for Health, I want to say something about Health Professions Wales. A body exists in Wales called the Health Professionals Council, and there is already much confusion about the responsibilities of the two bodies. I know that the Bill will give the National Assembly for Wales the power to change the name of the CHCs. I hope that that does not happen because they are widely recognised and respected. If a name works, why change it? It has cost the Royal Mail millions of pounds to work that out. Let us hope that the name of the CHCs is kept. The Assembly might need to reconsider the name of Health Professions Wales, which is the new body. I hope that Assembly is given the responsibility of examining the naming of the body. If there is confusion because one body is regulatory and one is not, I hope that that can be examined carefully.<br><br>
I hope that the changes will be streamlined as much as possible, that bureaucracy will be kept to a minimum and that costs will be carefully examined. Every pound that is spent on bureaucracy is a pound less spent on front-line health services.<br><br>
I have family and many friends who live in Wales, and I have experienced the health service in Wales at first hand. I, like every member of the Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0397">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
want a first-class health service for the people of Wales, and I will do anything and everything in my power to ensure that that comes about.</span></p>
<p>4.22 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee. I have shortly to attend another Committee to consider a statutory instrument, so I shall have to make only a brief point.<br><br>
The Bill calls on CHCs to have a greater scrutiny role, and I shall give an up-to-date example of why that is necessary. Almost exactly a year ago, I met a senior nurse who was working in Llandough hospital. She said that she and three or four of her colleagues were resigning because they were unhappy with the situation in that hospital's orthopaedic unit. She gave me a list of complaints, such as mismanagement, bullying, dirty wards and neglected patients. On 24 July 2001, I wrote to the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales asking her to examine the nurse's concerns. She replied to me shortly afterwards to say that there would be an investigation.<br><br>
My constituent—Pat Erickson—resigned, as she promised, with several of her colleagues and worked for agencies, as many nurses do. She has worked for five trusts in all ever since. She saw me on Monday and told me that she had bumped into one of her former managers during her work in the Cardiff and Vale NHS trust during recent weeks. A representative of the trust then wrote the agency a letter that said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It would be appreciated if you could confirm in writing to myself that Ms P. Erickson will not be offered for Agency employment to the NHS Trust."</p></blockquote>
Unison has taken up her case, but it seems that a person who is a clearly a whistleblower has been victimised. I hope that the CHCs' enhanced role will ensure that such victimisation is far less likely in the future.</span></p>
<p>4.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Kevin Brennan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is important because it will reform community health councils and set up the Wales Centre for Health and Health Professions Wales. They are important building blocks of the new health service in Wales that the National Assembly for Wales is constructing in conjunction with the Government in Westminster.<br><br>
As others said earlier, today's process is important. I believe in pre-legislative scrutiny. I count myself as incredibly fortunate in that the first Committee on which I was placed was that which considered the Adoption and Children Bill, which was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in that it was considered by a Special Standing Committee that took evidence from interested parties and key stakeholders in relation to the Bill before forming a Standing Committee for the usual knockabout and amendments in considering the Bill.<br><br>
This is an innovative and interesting procedure, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) on the work that the Welsh Affairs Committee has already done on the Bill. My hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) is not in his place, but I listened carefully to his observations on the constitutional position of how we approach the process of considering Bills that have a specific Welsh dimension or that go beyond the borders of Wales but contain elements that specifically relate to Wales.<br><br>
We should not be bound by the procedure but should innovate and experiment. One method that might be considered is that, instead of using simply the Welsh Affairs Committee, we have a Special Standing Committee that can take and consider evidence. It may not always be appropriate for the Select Committee to do so, as it has a scrutiny role as well as a pre-legislative role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ian Lucas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the advantage of setting up such a Special Standing Committee would be that Members with an interest in a particular area could be involved? The peculiar nature of the Welsh Affairs Committee is that it is spread across many different subject areas. Such a Standing Committee would have the advantage of being able to attract members who could bring their experience in particular fields to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kevin Brennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As always, my hon. Friend makes an extremely intelligent and cogent point that I should have thought of myself. It clearly would be an advantage from time to time to be able to draw on hon. Members' expertise in using the Special Standing Committee procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I give my hon. Friend something else to think about in relation to such a Committee? One of the features of the Select Committee system is that it is consensual. The matter needs a consensual Committee. Setting up a Standing Committee would duplicate what the House already does, which would be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kevin Brennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of respect for my hon. Friend, who has huge experience in the House compared with me. However, in my experience of the Special Standing Committee, at the evidence-taking stage, that was not true. There was cross-party working and understanding in the use of the procedure, just as I found in my work on a Select Committee.<br><br>
There is room to innovate. I do not have especially strong views on the matter, but I welcome pre-legislative scrutiny, which is important and which will contribute to improving the quality of legislation, especially that relating to Wales.<br><br>
As I said earlier, in setting up the three institutions, the Bill is a building block in the creation of the new Welsh NHS that is gradually evolving from the devolution settlement. I shall find something appropriate on which to hang the point, but earlier the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams) made several points about, and used various statistics to illustrate, the way in which he felt that the NHS in Wales was performing.<br><br>
I am sure that some figures that I have to give will be of great interest to the new Wales Centre for Health that the Bills sets up. There are features of the NHS in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
Wales, which have not been highlighted today, that are positive achievements and steps forwards. For example, we have heard nothing about the scrapping of NHS prescription charges for the under-25s. CHCs and the Wales Centre for Health will be interested in looking at such things. Another such matter is free dental checks for the over-60s and the under-25s. I do not think that there is powerful awareness of such developments across Wales. An all-Wales free mental health helpline has been set up, but I do not think that there is much awareness of it. We heard some talk earlier about staffing. Between 1997 and 2000 the number of NHS staff in Wales increased by 9 per cent. There are now 6,000 more NHS staff in Wales than in 1997. The number of nurses and health visiting staff increased by 440 between 2000 and 2001.<br><br>
I shall not try your patience for too much longer, Mr. Griffiths, but one or two more facts should be introduced into the debate. At least 1,385 medical students will have been enrolled in Wales by 2004, which answers some of the points made by Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans), and the annual intake of medical students increased between 1998 and 2001 from 190 to 290. We must recognise that progress is being made, not least in terms of the resources now being made available to the national health service in Wales to implement some of the changes in the draft Bill.<br><br>
The period 2003–04 will see an increase—not in real terms—of 10.41 per cent., 2004–05 an increase of 9.23 per cent, and the following years increases of 9.59 per cent., 9.3 per cent, and 9.59 per cent, in spending on the NHS in Wales. I would challenge any Opposition Member to say that the NHS could sustain any greater increase in terms of its capacity for the recruitment of staff and its physical capacity to expand services. This Bill is an important building block in the process of developing the new NHS in Wales that I am describing.<br><br>
I shall give one or two specific examples of matters that some of the new bodies in the Bill will want to monitor. Just last week I attended the opening of the new St. David's hospital in my constituency, Cardiff, West. It was closed under the Conservative Government by the late former Member for Cardiff, Central, Ian Grist, when he was a Minister with responsibility for health in the early 1990s. I remember a promise that it would be re-opened by the election. The problem was that we were not told which election. The 100-bed hospital has now been reopened and last week I attended its opening by the First Minister.<br><br>
Remarks were made earlier about the CHCs' power to inspect dental services. That hospital has an extremely exciting and innovative new community dental facility, which will also be a teaching facility for final-year students from University hospital, Cardiff. They will be being taught, and learning their trade, out in the community, which is where they should be, because 85 per cent, of those dental students end up practising in the community, unlike in other medical professions, where a higher proportion of students often end up working in hospitals. That is a fantastic, innovative, new, excellent facility. We want to see such facilities rolled out across Wales in years to come as a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
result of the commitment to putting extra resources into the NHS.<br><br>
I have another, smaller, example of something that might be of interest to the bodies that the draft Bill establishes. Last Saturday, I attended the Ely festival in my constituency and was pleased to be able to participate in Heart Ely, a project funded by the health inequalities fund, set up by the National Assembly to promote public health. If we are to improve health in Wales, we have to concentrate not just on waiting times and waiting lists, but on improving public health in the first place. I was happy to participate at the stall at the Ely festival. I was weighed, and I am glad to report that I am not overweight—much to my surprise, having spent a year in this House. The project was exciting, innovative and out in the community, where it should be. It was another example of the sort of changes that we need to deliver a better health service after many years of neglect and lack of investment in the NHS, and a lack of the necessary reforms—the sort of reforms that are in the Bill.<br><br>
We know that there are still huge problems to overcome in the national health service in Wales. We are dealing with a legacy of neglect, and an attempt to undermine the fundamental principles of the NHS through slow death by cuts. I welcome the Bill. It is designed to keep the NHS in Wales close to the community and to improve its structure. I welcome today's discussion of the draft Bill.</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, believe that the pre-legislative scrutiny is a beneficial part of the legislative process. One of the Committees that I first sat on when I came to the House scrutinised the Animal Health Bill, which had certainly not benefited from pre-legislative scrutiny. If some of its worst excesses had been identified at an early stage and modified, or eliminated altogether, parts of that Bill that could prove very beneficial to the agricultural industry—and Wales—would now be in force, and would be able to ensure that outbreaks such as foot and mouth would be less likely to threaten rural industries. An element of that Bill referred specifically to Wales, and I am sure that the Welsh Affairs Committee could have beneficially considered that as well.<br><br>
Although pre-legislative scrutiny is a good process, scrutiny of a Bill that refers to a devolved Assembly is tricky in many ways. It involves talking about matters that the Assembly holds very dear. I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), for so expertly manoeuvring through the maze of tricky decisions, at the end of which the devolved process had been strengthened. The process that we have gone through will help in future cases when pre-legislative scrutiny takes place.<br><br>
I, too, agree with the setting up of the three bodies proposed in the Bill. I do not think that anyone here has spoken against them. The only reservation that I would have is that the Assembly has to be careful not to produce a duplication of effort or responsibility, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
that is more to do with the management ability of the Assembly than the legislation that is put in place.<br><br>
Key to it all are the proposals to retain the CHCs in Wales. I was interested that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) was supportive of that as well. They have undertaken hugely important work in Wales, and in England for that matter. The Bill will build upon that important work, and give them added responsibilities and tasks that will help to ensure that the health of the Welsh nation is improved substantially. It is all part of a process of making the health service in Wales more responsive to local need and more under the control of local people. It was interesting the Plaid Cymru seemed less coterminous about coterminosity than at first. It is important that local health boards and local authorities are conterminous because they are concerned with the delivery of service; it is not so important for CHCs because they are concerned with monitoring and acting as an advocate for patients or groups of patients in a community.<br><br>
If the Bill is introduced, CHCs will have the power and responsibility to inspect private facilities as well as national health facilities and, for that reason, it has been said that National Health Service (Wales) Bill is not the most appropriate title. That should be considered as the draft Bill proceeds, because it is important and right that the title should incorporate reference to the powers that will be given to CHCs. I welcome the fact that CHCs will be involved in primary health care and dentistry, but it is difficult to know how dentistry will be inspected in areas that I represent where no NHS dentist has practised for several years. That is of great concern. Perhaps the CHCs can do something to highlight that problem and ensure that such facilities be made available in future.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley made an important point about the role of CHCs in consultation. When the maternity facility of Brecon War Memorial hospital in my constituency was changed from being GP-led to midwife-led, the CHC was allowed to oppose the change only if it could come up with an alternative system for delivering maternity care in the area. I am sure that CHC members and their staff have all sorts of skills, but it should not fall to them to suggest an alternative system for delivering maternity, or any other, health care. They have a right to object to the implications that a decision might have for those living in an area, and to draw them to the attention of those taking the decision.<br><br>
I am sure that there will be a huge amount of work for those serving on CHCs which will take up a great deal of their time. Some of their time will necessarily be taken up by training. Without the necessary skills to observe, report and reach conclusions, there is little point in staff undertaking work and inspections. Some skills will be present already, and some will need improving and developing.<br><br>
I, too, should like CHCs to be responsible for health care in prisons and young offender units. However, I should like them also to consider the health care delivered in schools. School dentists,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
doctors and nurses provide an enormous amount of advice and treatment in schools, and unless those are of top quality, children will not have the advantages that they could have, and they may suffer disadvantages.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) asked whether the Liberal Democrats could support all the recommendations in the Welsh Affairs Committee report. As far as I can ascertain, only one—on page 18—gave the party any difficulty. That recommendation reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the power which it is proposed to give to NAW"—</p></blockquote>
the National Assembly for Wales—
<br><blockquote><p>"to allocate any functions to AWCHC"—</p></blockquote>
the association of Welsh community health councils—
<br><blockquote><p>"be constrained by providing that they should be related to its core statutory functions of advice, assistance and support to CHCs."</p></blockquote>
A number of people thought that that was rather prescriptive, but the problem lies more in nuance than anything else. If the Assembly were to be restricted to using its core functions, that concern might have substance, but the recommendation is that functions be constrained around the core, so it could easily be sorted out.<br><br>
It is important that we put in place some of the bricks that will give Wales a responsive health service that is locally controlled and delivered. These are building blocks and there is much more to put in place, but we welcome the draft Bill.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Chris Ruane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by apologising for my absence at the start of the sitting this morning. I had to take a delegation of 16 young people from the Foyer project in Rhyl around the House. I apologise to you, Mr. Griffiths, and the Committee.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Select Committee, my right hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones)—[<i>Interruption</i>.] Have I let it slip that he feels right and honourable? I pay tribute to his interpersonal skills, especially on the draft Bill. We are on new ground in dealing with the National Assembly for Wales and during the past two or three years he has handled Committee work very well and professionally. He has had to deal with National Assembly civil servants, the First Minister, Kirsty Williams, Chairperson of the Health and Social Services Committee, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and the junior Minister. He has handled that very well to a tight time scale. Tribute should also be paid to the officers supporting the Committee: Tom Healey and David Natzler, the Clerks, and Paul Derrett and Amanda Waller, the officials who look after our visits to Wales. We had some excellent visits to the Assembly. This could be a blueprint for a joint approach to draft Bills affecting Wales, whether they are stand-alone Bills applying specifically to Wales, or clauses that apply to Wales in Bills covering England and Wales.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to unannounced visits. They are the key to effective CHCs. In Cardiff, we heard evidence from someone involved with CHCs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
about a matter that had been referred to her: a private care home had had no rubber gloves available for two weeks, which posed a danger to those who worked in that care home and to patients. Had a visit been announced, those rubber gloves would have been in place and everything would have been spick and span. That is an excellent example of the necessity for unannounced visits. We should encourage whistleblowers in the private and public sectors. The previous Conservative Government had a down on whistleblowers and saw them as troublemakers. I believe that they should be encouraged and that the information that they provide should be acted on immediately for better health in Wales.<br><br>
The powers should be extended to prisons, perhaps at a later date. The Select Committee held a short inquiry into young Welsh people in prison and was told that 600 young Welsh people were in prison—300 in Wales and 300 outside Wales—150 of whom were at Ashfield prison in Bristol. Of those in prison, 84 per cent, tested positive for drugs when they went to prison. They have massive health problems and perhaps social problems also. How they are treated outside Wales needs to be monitored carefully to ensure that when they re-integrate into society— hopefully back in Wales—they do so as better people.<br><br>
In the Select Committee, I asked whether £1.8 million is sufficient to fund the CHCs. The health budget in Wales is currently £3.2 billion and by 2005–06 it will have risen to £5.8 billion. I know that there are other methods of scrutiny and monitoring, but CHCs are important. Is £1.8 million enough to spend on monitoring £5.8 billion? I am aware that the Chairman of the Committee rapped my knuckles and said that the matter did not fall within the Committee's area of responsibility, but it is important to raise it at this stage.<br><br>
On funding, many members of the Committee felt that the people who sat on the CHCs should come from wider and more varied backgrounds, and that people who were in full-time employment could be debarred from daytime involvement because they would lose out financially. With extra funding we may obtain a wider variety of recruits for the CHCs.<br><br>
Advocacy is a key role for CHCs, certainly in my constituency. The Clwyd community health council is one of the best CHCs in Wales and has helped me on many occasions during the five years since I was elected in dealing with health issues brought to me as constituency MP. It has helped with both individual and group cases. For example, a number of people from north Wales were receiving treatment at an orthopaedic centre in Rochdale that they felt was effective and from which they were benefiting. The North Wales health authority, however, decided to end that treatment. I contacted the CHCs in Wales and convened a meeting. They gave me their full support in marshalling all the arguments, and those patients were allowed to continue their health care at the orthopaedic centre in Rochdale.<br><br>
With regard to diversity, it is great that there are health and social services boards in Northern Ireland, patients forums in England, CHCs in Wales and health councils in Scotland. It is a case of vive la
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
difference, because those health councils pursue their own agendas for their regions, but it is also important that best practice is swapped between those areas not only on the issue of community health councils but on the issue of health generally in the UK. We often hear the cry of "Welsh solutions to Welsh problems." That is all well and good, but at some point in time there may be an Irish solution to a Welsh problem, a Welsh solution to an Irish problem, or a Scottish solution to a Welsh problem. There is a danger that we may become too insular, too blinkered and too chauvinistic in saying that the only answers that we can find are in Wales. There may be excellent practice outside Wales and there should be a formal mechanism by which best practice from those four countries—and from Europe and around the world—is taken from wherever it occurs and brought home to Wales.<br><br>
The Wales Centre for Health is an excellent initiative and the dissemination of information should be encouraged. Research is undertaken around the world and we need to make sure that we are on top of it in order to bring home best practice to Wales.<br><br>
The other issue is the collection of data within Wales. There are areas in Wales in which data used to be collected, but where the practice is now falling by the wayside. All the institutions that deal with health in Wales need to collect data to a very fine degree. Perhaps we could use the example of how North Wales police collect data on crime and disorder. Data is collected on a ward-by-ward basis in 19 brackets under disorder and 10 under crime. I encourage the Wales Centre for Health to operate on similar lines. In fact, data must be broken down not just by wards but by streets and postcodes so that we can plot the patterns of bad and good health in Wales and marshal our resources to best effect in the communities.<br><br>
All in all, the draft Bill is excellent. I enjoyed serving on the Committee and working with the National Assembly. I hope that the blueprint that we have set out will continue to be followed in future.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wayne David <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like other hon. Members, I warmly welcome the draft Bill and the process in which we are currently engaged. I echo the comments of several hon. Members who said that we were making a small part of history in our deliberations today. During the past few weeks, the Welsh Affairs Committee considered the draft Bill in some detail and prepared an excellent report, which is extremely readable and reaches succinct and apposite conclusions. The deliberations of the Welsh Affairs Committee are part of a pre-legislative scrutiny process, which is of constitutional significance.<br><br>
I am pleased that there has been good co-operation with the National Assembly for Wales. I was interested in the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North on the participation of Members from this House and from the National Assembly's Health and Social Services Committee. I am also pleased to read in the report that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales and Jane Hutt, a Minister from the National Assembly, gave evidence in a joint session. All those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0401">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
activities are most commendable and show that devolution is working.<br><br>
Today we have this very important debate in the Welsh Grand Committee. I say that it is very important because I want to underline the fact that primary legislative powers remain with Westminster under the devolution settlement. However, devolution is essentially a partnership between the Administrations in London and Cardiff. Therefore, as Members of this House, we must ensure that we play a proactive role. We are just as important in the legislative process as are the Members of the National Assembly, and we can only demonstrate that by our participation in deliberations such as these.<br><br>
As we have heard, the draft Bill essentially consists of three parts: the first is about maintaining and enhancing community health councils in Wales, the second creates the Wales Centre for Health and the third establishes Health Professions Wales. In my brief contribution, I want to concentrate on the first element—community health councils. I am a keen advocate of CHCs as a result of my practical experience as the Member for Caerphilly for the past 12 months. All my contact with the Gwent CHC has been very positive. I am delighted with the support that I get as an elected Member but, more important, I am very pleased with the support that the CHC gives to my constituents.<br><br>
Gwent CHC consists of some 60 members, who are drawn from a wide range of backgrounds and experience. I believe that, by and large, there is a high degree of commitment to the work of the CHC. However, I am glad that the draft legislation is not just about maintaining CHCs and developing a model that is different from England's but about improving the work of CHCs. I am especially pleased that there will be an elaboration of two aspects of the work of CHCs. The first concerns the extension of their remit into primary care and nursing homes—at least, that is what I believe the draft Bill advocates. I say that because I read the text of the draft Bill not once but twice and three times. To a layperson such as myself it is not entirely clear. There is no better way to demonstrate that than by quoting the draft Bill. It states that the Assembly may make regulations requiring
<br><blockquote><p>(g) persons providing services under Part 2 of this Act or under arrangements under section 28C of this Act; or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(h) persons providing piloted services under pilot schemes established under section 28 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 (c.15), or providing 1p services under an LPS scheme established under Schedule 8A to this Act,<br><br> to allow members of a Council authorised by or under the regulations to enter and inspect, for the purposes of any of the Council's functions, premises owned or controlled by those referred to in paragraphs (a) to (h).</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very clear. Well read.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that hon. Members are able to comprehend the linguistic idiosyncrasies of the text to a greater extent than me. I am reliably informed by several sources that, basically, there will be an extension of the work of the CHCs into the two sectors to which I referred: the community sector and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
private sector. I welcome that, because my experience of private nursing homes has not been entirely good.<br><br>
Without naming names, I am strongly of the view that standards could be much higher in some private nursing homes. That is not to say that CHCs can replace the work of professional services. Nevertheless, they can play an important role in ensuring that higher standards are maintained and that there is greater external vigilance. The extension of CHCs into that area is a positive step forward, and I am glad that the CHCs themselves welcome and recognise the important development.<br><br>
It is also important to state that the draft Bill provides recognition of the advocacy services provided by CHCs. Much work already goes on. I can once again cite my own work with regard to my constituency efforts in which I have learned that CHCs provide a valuable service. However, we must recognise that that type of advocacy support is not uniform throughout Wales. We need a higher standard and a degree of consistency. I am therefore pleased that the National Assembly has indicated that—as recorded in the regulatory impact assessment—extra resources of some £481,000 per year will be provided to develop the work of some of the services that already exist. The services that I hope will be developed, and from which lessons can be learned, include the pathfinder advocacy schemes in Cardiff and Gwent.<br><br>
I am sure that with their new powers and additional resources, CHCs throughout Wales will develop a coherent and comprehensive system of advocacy services. However, we should also recognise that they will not be operating in isolation. Of necessity, they will have to work with others in the field and I hope that there will be close co-operation with the Children's Commissioner for Wales and other bodies.<br><br>
In conclusion, although modest in size, the draft Bill is a significant step forward in terms of the development of the national health service in Wales. It is also a step forward in constitutional terms. I hope that in his winding-up speech, the Under-Secretary will not only respond and give clarification to some of the points in the draft Bill, but will tell us whether he believes that the excellent deliberations that have taken place so far have set a precedent for future legislation. I hope that that will be the case. The lessons to be learned from such an experience are positive and they will ensure that devolution works not only in theory but in practice.</span></p>
<p>5.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone who wishes devolution to prosper and succeed in Wales, I welcome our historic proceedings and the modest but important Bill for the future of the health service in Wales, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) described it. The Bill is a landmark in the process of devolution; it will strengthen communication between the National Assembly for Wales and Westminster during the pre-legislative process. I am quietly confident that it will be successful and I am sure that it highlights an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
appropriate way forward for improved legislation for our constituents.<br><br>
It has been useful to examine the process with a fresh pair of eyes. The Bill and I have travelled down varying, strange paths to arrive here together in Committee Room 16.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Committee Room 14.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for correcting me. I hope that it is the only correction that I shall face today.<br><br>
The Bill began as an announcement in the Queen's Speech in June 2001, when I was a prospective parliamentary candidate for Brecon and Radnorshire. In November it was given further wings and a boost, when I was still recovering from contesting that by-election in the largest seat geographically in Wales. The Select Committee pointed out that the pre-legislative scrutiny period fell two months short of the usual consultation period. However, after the excellent scrutiny, the Bill and I have arrived here together in Committee Room 14.<br><br>
I shall now discuss the meat of the Bill. The retention and enhancement of the CHCs and the creation of a Wales Centre for Health and a new statutory body, Health Professions Wales, have sparked little controversy. In fact, to date, they have attracted great agreement. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North complimented members of the Committee on their willingness to concentrate, rightly, on the detail of the legislation rather than on political differences. However, I do not rule out the fact that political differences have yet to emerge and that Opposition Members may just be keeping their powder dry and stored away tightly.<br><br>
The CHCs have a crucial role to play in giving a local voice to people and influencing health outcomes in Wales. The great challenges in respect of health improvement and delivering a good health service have been mentioned today. The picture is not all bleak, but neither is it uniformly good. Great challenges are ahead. The Association of Welsh Community Health Councils—unfortunately, if I say the acronym quickly, it sounds like "Ouch"—can provide a national, strategic voice in the NHS in Wales.<br><br>
Historical variations in the role and performance of CHCs were dealt with in the report and at the evidence-taking stage. Enhanced CHCs with a new, extended role will need to have consistently high standards. In short, the Bill provides CHCs and the AWCHC with greater potential to effect positive change in the lives and health of people in Wales. The Welsh public in constituencies in Ogmore, Wrexham and Powys, although not necessarily in the Ribble Valley, will expect them to perform.<br><br>
The CHCs and the AWCHC will fulfil specific duties. In line with the practice of other organisations from which people absent themselves to carry out duties for the public good, employees should be allowed limited time off work with appropriate remuneration, too. That is particularly important in order to encourage a different and wide variety of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
people to take part in such duties. If we want the CHCs to be truly representative, let us give people the time off work and give them the remuneration to go with it. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley; ways have to be explored to achieve that and difficulties for small businesses must be examined.<br><br>
In addition, I can reiterate the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower and others this morning. They identified the need to allow the possibility of extending the remit of inspection visits to prisons and other establishments in which people are detained for physical and psychological health reasons. Although that will not be a substitute for the regular lay visits that are carried out by other organisations, the concentration on health needs and well-being will usefully complement their focus.<br><br>
In any area and region of Wales it is often too easy to point the finger at deficiencies within the health service—to say, frequently on the basis of anecdotal evidence, that this proves that the NHS is in crisis, or that that proves that it is on the verge of meltdown. During the Ogmore by-election, the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend—which is my local district general hospital—was pilloried by the Opposition parties for poor standards of cleanliness and catering. That is when the CHCs came in. However, the Opposition parties neglected to point out that the problems that they had newly discovered in the by-election had been flagged up by the joint staff and management board—an innovation in employee relations that was brought forward by a Labour Government—or that the hospital was working to put them right. They also neglected to point out that the staff deficiencies that were identified were the result of chronic underfunding over two decades. I pay tribute to the staff of that hospital. I also state that one of the important things about CHCs is the fact that they, as well as the boards of the hospitals, can flag up such issues and thereby identify the challenges that lie ahead and show the way forward.<br><br>
A picture has been painted today of the poor standard of some parts of the NHS, which is relevant to the Bill. However, that is in sharp contrast to what has happened at the Maesteg community hospital, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) would say the same about Ystradgynlais community hospital, where the standards are very good, the morale is very high, and the staff are well received—even treasured—by the community.<br><br>
I briefly turn to the cross-boundary working of the CHCs. There has been much discussion about the need to avoid overlapping enclaves of CHCs, which could lead to omission by default or duplication of effort. It must also be recognised that CHCs that represent contiguous areas will often need to work together, because they will find common causes or concerns. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire will remember an instance that is relevant to that point; two years ago, on a blustery evening in a packed hall in Ystradgynlais, more than 500 people gathered to protest against potential bed closures in the community hospital. I should declare an interest in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
this matter, because my wife works part-time at the hospital—to escape the clutches of my children, I think. The closure of those beds would have affected the hon. Gentleman's constituents in Powys, and those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Peter Hain). Two trusts, two constituencies and two boundaries were involved; that highlights why CHCs will increasingly need to work effectively together, particularly as they will have these enhanced roles and responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman therefore see a role for associations of CHCs in supervising such matters? For instance, there are very few specialists in Wales who deal with myalgic encephalomyelitis, and associations might take evidence from all of the CHCs and say, "Something needs to be done to provide more specialists in this area."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. There is a significant strategic role to be performed in identifying such particular needs across regions throughout Wales. However, I am currently addressing cross-boundary working, which is very much a local issue. It is easy to set down arbitrary boundaries that are based on good practice and the existing formation of local health groups and so on, but it will not necessarily always be the case that that is the best way to work over particular problems and challenges. However, I take on board the hon. Gentleman's point that there is a strategic role to be performed.<br><br>
In conclusion, I turn to the process of devolution that we are currently engaged in. It was not easy for Wales to win devolution, but it was won, and I understand that even the Conservatives in Wales—an elusive breed—have recently become convinced that it is here, and that it must be made to work. That is a triumph indeed. [<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Gentleman has disappeared; that cannot be the result of anything that I said. The process of devolution is also not easy. A new institution is finding its feet and determining its role. That process is not easy for Members of Parliament either. We slave over matters such as policing, defence, foreign affairs, international aid, pensions and welfare—not forgetting the Barnett-plus plus settlement that we have received today with over £15 billion of devolved and non-devolved funding for Wales. Labour leads that with a little help and encouragement from its friends—the Liberal Democrats in Wales. However, like a parent who has seen his teenage son cut off and leave home for the first time to make his own way in the world, we look on with a little bit of jealousy and longing.<br><br>
This meeting of the Committee and the historic humble draft Bill are innovative ways of strengthening the bond between the mother of Parliaments and the potential-filled offspring in Wales. Through dialogue on primary and secondary legislation, we have begun to communicate more effectively for the benefit of Wales and its people. In legislative and other terms, we must keep that dialogue going. I commend the draft Bill and the historic process of which it is part.</span></p>

<p>5.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you and other members of the Committee for missing the start of this afternoon's sitting, Mr. Griffiths. I was in a meeting with a Minister about the United Kingdom Passport Agency and an issue that I raised on the Floor of the House a few weeks ago.<br><br>
I welcome this Committee's examination of the draft Bill following the publication of the report of the investigation by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. Before last year, I was a member of that Committee, which was a great privilege, and I am pleased that a new hon. Member has taken my place. It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), who speaks so fluently on behalf of his constituency and on issues that affect the Ogmore valley.<br><br>
The subject demonstrates the continuing relevance of our Welsh parliamentary forums with regard to examining contemporary issues that relate to Wales. It is a prime example of the House of Commons undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny and shows the value of the Welsh Affairs Committee examining primary legislation that relates to Wales. As hon. Members have said, the draft Bill aims to retain and enhance the role of community health councils, to establish the Wales Centre for Health as a multidisciplinary body to monitor public health and influence decision making, and to create Health Professions Wales as a statutory body that is accountable to the National Assembly for Wales.<br><br>
As hon. Members have said, it is unlikely that we would have the Bill if we did not have the National Assembly for Wales, and I greatly welcome that development. The Bill is a testimony to the fact that democratic devolution and the National Assembly are addressing the people of Wales in a manner that recognises Wales' distinct problems and characteristics.<br><br>
I have had an interest in the subject for some time. I have served on a community health council in Coventry, and before my election I was a university lecturer specialising in social policy and involved with the education and training of many people who later worked in the health care field and related social services.<br><br>
With respect to devolution and health, I believe that there is scope for a distinctly Welsh approach to Wales' health needs. For example, the National Assembly is committed to addressing health inequalities as part of its strategy to combat social exclusion. In addition, the Welsh population, especially in valley communities, have a poorer health status than the population of England—for example, the people of Blaenau Gwent are served by Nevill Hall hospital, which is the general hospital in my constituency. Of course, there are specific health problems in rural areas. My constituency of Monmouthshire is one of Wales' rural areas. It is a great credit to Jane Hutt, the National Assembly's Minister for Health and Social Services, that she was persuaded to retain community health councils in Wales with an enhanced role. The Bill is a testimony to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
the representations that were made to her and the wise decisions that she took.<br><br>
I was a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee when it conducted its short inquiry on women who are imprisoned in Wales—there are no prisons for women in Wales. My constituency contains Usk prison and Prescoed young offenders institution. The health needs of the prison population have been mentioned during my visits to the institutions, and I welcome moves to ensure that the prison health service comes within the remit of the national health service. I am sure that that will improve standards. Members of the Committee— including my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, North, and for Gower—and I visited the women in that prison in Gloucestershire. We were stunned by the concerns about mental health provision for the prison population.<br><br>
Like other members of the Committee, I should like to pay tribute to all those who serve on community health councils. I was in regular contact with the North Gwent and South Gwent CHCs, which have now been amalgamated into Gwent community health council. I pay tribute to Bob Hall, who was the chairman of the Gwent CHC and gave evidence to the Select Committee. Gwent CHC has a new structure and is now coterminous with the Gwent Healthcare NHS trust and a system of area committees that reflect the size of Gwent. The chairman of the Monmouthshire committee is Sylvia Gilbert, who has long campaigned on behalf of public sector workers, especially those who are on low pay. I am grateful for the correspondence that I have had with her about some of the issues that concern the CHC in Monmouthshire.<br><br>
The Gwent CHC recently investigated a problem concerning Monmouth's ambulance service that may concern other hon. Members representing the Gwent area. Ambulances are tied up at Royal Gwent hospital for hours, waiting to discharge patients to admission wards. Some hon. Members and I have made representations about that. The CHC has given support to the new health and social care facility proposed for Monmouth. That pioneering new establishment will recognise the essential interrelationship between health and social care. That important new development has recently been given full approval and will now go ahead.<br><br>
The community health council has also held investigations into cleanliness and hygiene standards in local hospitals, bed blocking, and hospital car parking provision. It has also considered the particularly controversial "patientline" service, whereby patients are required to pay for television and telephone access at what I consider to be extortionate rates, especially for those on low incomes and those who are in hospital for a long time.<br><br>
There has also been a particularly important investigation into dental services. I raised that matter in Committee this morning. In Monmouth and Abergavenny, no one could get access to an NHS dentist unless they were, for example, on benefits. People expect there to be dentists who will give them NHS treatment, because the cost of private treatment can be prohibitive for many people. I am pleased that,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
following representations, the National Assembly and the Gwent health authority addressed the problem, so there will be NHS dental provision in future.<br><br>
However, I reiterate what I said this morning: there is concern that dentists are attracted to an area by grants to establish or expand a practice, and they give the impression that they will provide NHS cover. Then, in due course, they write to most or all of their patients and say, "We're not going to do this any more. We invite you to join Denplan, a private insurance dental service." Many of my constituents have taken exception to that. They believed that they were signing up to be treated by a dentist on NHS terms and not to a private health insurance system. I hope that the relevant bodies will investigate that issue.<br><br>
I support the Select Committee's recommendations that CHC members should be given time off for their public duties, and that CHCs should have access to information that covers areas of their remit, and should have the power to commission other bodies to undertake independent advocacy services. I hope that the other bodies that will be established as a result of the Bill—the Wales Centre for Health and Health Professions Wales—can consider some of the other issues that affect Wales, and particularly my constituency. One of them has been the scarcity of consultant neurologists in Wales, which has been drawn to my attention by representatives of the Parkinson's Disease Society and those who represent patients with epilepsy. A new consultant has been appointed at Nevill Hall, but I believe that she works only part-time, in conjunction with her work in Cardiff.<br><br>
As other Members said, we need to consider ME and its recognition by the health care field. There is great variation in how ME is dealt with. I speak as a patron, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Llew Smith), of the Gwent ME Society.<br><br>
I hope that the bodies involved will be able to consider the issue of new consultants' contracts. That has been a welcome development on the part of the Minister, Jane Hutt, and Ministers in England. It is important that consultants trained by the national health service work exclusively for the national health service, and they deserve to be rewarded for their dedication.<br><br>
Finally, I welcome the Select Committee's inquiry. I pay tribute to all those who work in the national health service and related social services. It has been a great pleasure for me to make representations on behalf of my constituents about problems that affect the health service. I hope that the Bill is passed without difficulty and that health provision in Wales will improve as a result of it.</span></p>
<p>5.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Adam Price <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Historic" has been the most overused word in today's debate. I add to the historic nature of the proceedings by resisting my usual tendency to launch into a 12 or 15-minute tirade castigating the Government for all their inadequacies. That may be

evidence of the civilising effect of being a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Character building.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Adam Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.<br><br>
As has been said, the Bill is short and uncontentious, but that has not prevented hon. Members from finding something to disagree about, sometimes on the thinnest of premises. It is fair to say that, in terms of the Bill's contents, only a few cigarette papers separate Opposition and Labour Members. Our complaint relates to what is not in the Bill: my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon raised several issues. We should have liked a reference to a separate health audit body, which may come in due course with the audit Bill that may feature in the Queen's Speech following our return.<br><br>
On the process, I pay tribute to the skill of the Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee and the staff in navigating us through a tight time scale. It has been a good-humoured and assiduous process—Parliament at its best. Unfortunately, much of it took place behind closed doors, but the Committee added a lot of value to the pre-legislative process.<br><br>
There was confusion, a lack of clarity and frustration among some stakeholders. For instance, the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists said that it was disappointed that the draft Bill did not explicitly mention the professional bodies covered by the legislation. It felt that there had been a disappointing lack of consultation with some professional bodies, and it felt slightly marginalised. The Welsh board of the British Psychological Society said that it was unclear about the role of Health Professions Wales in relation to itself.<br><br>
There are lessons to be learned. The Wales Office could learn from the Welsh Affairs Committee, whose consultation involved a wide range of bodies.<br><br>
The Secretary of State was right to say that the Welsh Affairs Committee made some interesting proposals. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Clwyd, South, the Plaid Cymru parliamentary group is happy to endorse the recommendations, with the one qualifying statement made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. Clearly it is a matter for our Assembly colleagues to respond to in their own time and in due course in the plenary debate in the National Assembly. However, some positive proposals have been made, and I shall touch on one or two of them.<br><br>
The issue of the membership of community health councils was first raised by the hon. Member for Gower and was subsequently mentioned by several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane). The issue of the extent to which community health councils are representative has been raised consistently in the past. It was mentioned in the evidence to the Committee given by the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association, who hoped that as a result of the Bill CHCs would become more representative of the communities that they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
represent, and would put mechanisms in place to ensure that currently excluded groups were included in the membership. I consider that the Committee is right to stress maximum discretion for the National Assembly in implementing the legislation. The recommendation of allowing statutory time off for members almost had cross-party support—perhaps we can tempt the hon. Member for Ribble Valley in due course. I would be interested if the Minister gave some indication of the Government's view at this early stage.<br><br>
The issue of coterminosity was mentioned by several hon. Members. It has been Plaid Cymru policy since 1994 that CHCs should be coterminous with local health boards. Clearly, we have always operated a policy of subsidiarity. Where there are pressing local concerns, hon. Members may take their own view. Under current arrangements, most CHCs are coterminous, but there are several exceptions, and that has the potential to cause confusion and a lack of clarity, particularly in parts of the Glamorgan valleys, and in my constituency. We are entering into an era of greater coterminosity, but some hon. Members were right to stress the need for flexibility, particularly with a view to counties with large land masses such as Powys and Gwynedd. In the case of Carmarthenshire, I feel that the benefits of transparency and coterminosity outweigh any disbenefits. The Committee has got the balance right in seeking to ensure that the Administration and the Assembly give proper regard to the advantages of coterminosity without unduly constraining them from taking into account particular local circumstances.<br><br>
The Committee referred to the need to give the National Assembly for Wales the power to extend the scope of community health councils' powers to inspect premises. Other hon. Members also focused on the issue of prisons where the NHS is providing services locally. Unfortunately, as the Bill is currently drafted, the power to scrutinise will not be extended. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the power to extend that to prisons could not be included in the legislation.<br><br>
The accountability of community health councils was raised by several hon. Members. It is a fine line to tread to ensure the independence of CHCs while ensuring some sort of framework for performance management across the whole of Wales. In his evidence, Professor Warner expressed concern that the designation of the Association of Welsh Community Health Councils as an advisory body could frustrate ambitions to create a more seamless level of service throughout Wales.<br><br>
We had several interesting contributions from Members from Cardiff constituencies. It is widely accepted that the community health council in Cardiff is something of a beacon and an exemplar of best practice in Wales. Why do we then see this variation in the level of engagement between CHCs in Wales, and how can we ensure some kind of accountability mechanism to spread best practice throughout Wales? The Committee has made some tentative recommendations as to how that could be achieved.<br><br>
The ability of the National Assembly to commission specialist service providers in terms of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
advocacy is raised in the report, and was also raised by several hon. Members. The other issue in terms of independence of CHCs is their independence not from the Assembly, but from the very bodies that they are intended to scrutinise. Some concern has been expressed in the past at the collocation—not coterminosity—with health authorities in some cases, where for technical reasons the staff are actually employed by the health authority. Because of that, there has been some public perception that CHCs are part and parcel of the local health authority structure. Obviously, that must be examined and could possibly be addressed during the passage of the Bill.<br><br>
Securing and ensuring the independence of the Wales Centre for Health was very much at the forefront of the Committee's deliberations. Much evidence that we received from witnesses stressed that element, in the light of concern in Wales about landfill. In that regard the Secretary of State mentioned Nantygwyddon, where we are bringing over experts from outside Wales at the moment. In future, it would be very positive to have a rigorously independent source of specialist advice in Wales, which the public and communities could approach themselves. We should be grateful for further reassurance and perhaps some guidance on how such independence could be written into the Bill.<br><br>
On diversity, a positive aspect of the Wales Centre for Health is the fact that written into its objectives will be the aim of looking not only at best practice across the whole United Kingdom, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley and others stressed, but at best practice globally, and at international multi-professional bodies. The Welsh Food Alliance mentioned the interesting experiments in northern Karelia into the relationship between food and health outcomes. Certainly, we know that diet is an important factor in Wales and there are a wide range of lessons to be drawn on internationally. We look forward in due course to the Wales Centre for Health embarking on such matters.<br><br>
The Committee expressed some unease about the powers of direction conferred on the National Assembly for Wales in relation to Health Professions Wales. Similarly, the Committee wants, as does my party, to ensure that Health Professions Wales has sufficient independence as a statutory body. My hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon mentioned Welsh language. I should be grateful if the Minister would reply on that point in due course.<br><br>
I have resisted raising the dreaded issue of resources. I was almost going to complete an entire speech without mentioning the Barnett formula but, unfortunately, I was provoked by the hon. Member for Ogmore. I say to him that the comprehensive spending review may have been Barnett plus, but it was Wanless double minus in terms of the health settlement for Wales. Once again, we shall see a lower rate of increase in health spending for Wales than for England.<br><br>
We absolutely support the objectives of the Bill and we look forward to the positive changes that will be wrought.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might be interested to know that I challenged the Secretary of State for Education and Skills this afternoon on the spending allocated to the devolved areas—compared with the increase of 28.5 per cent, during the next three years, there will be only 21.6 per cent, for Wales. Those are Library figures. The right hon. Lady answered:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member knows as well as I know that it is due to the application of the historic process called the Barnett formula",</p></blockquote>
which means that we are being—[<i>Interruption</i>.]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Adam Price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Adam Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to test your patience further, Mr. Griffiths. It has already been severely tested by hon. Members during this debate. The issue of resources for the Wales Centre for Health and Health Professions Wales has been raised by some of the unions of the health professions, which have asked, for example, whether there will be additional resources to fund the new bodies. That is an important issue. Putting aside the usual, rumbustious debates that we have in the Committee, the Barnett squeeze is as much an issue for Opposition Members as for Labour Members and I hope that we shall be able to have a mature and serious debate about how the Barnett squeeze is impeding our ability to deliver the health outcomes that we all want.</span></p>
<p>5.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very good debate. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South, Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee, and his colleagues on the Committee for their work in producing the report that we are considering today. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said when he opened today's debate, this pre-legislative scrutiny is a new process, which we welcome. We have a green light from the Prime Minister and it will probably continue.<br><br>
The Government consulted widely on the draft Bill. Indeed, 89 organisations and individuals were consulted and we received responses from 12, including local authorities, health professions, community health councils and individuals. We also received an e-mail from Mr. Liu Lei who runs a company in China and offered to sell us an excellent forging hammer.<br><br>
The draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill originates from our ambition to improve health in Wales. Much of it goes back to the "Better Health Better Wales" document that was produced by the Welsh Office. Following that, my right hon. Friend the First Minister and Jane Hutt, the Minister for Health and Social Services, launched a document entitled "Improving Health in Wales" in February, which followed in the path of our building blocks.<br><br>
At the outset, we had an ambitious list of things that we wanted to include in legislation and we were able to accommodate two items in the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002 and particularly two sections that allow us to create local health boards and require local health and well-being strategies to be put in place. They were time
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
sensitive and it was important that the Assembly had decided to abolish health authorities and we were able to do that on time. That is an important tool in working towards the reform agenda that we want for the health service in Wales, with the Government and the Assembly working in partnership. In addition, we had a list of things that we wanted to include in earlier legislation, particularly reform of community health councils and the establishment of the Wales Centre for Health and Health Professions Wales. The draft Bill includes those three remaining elements, so we shall continue the reform process.<br><br>
The need to reform and strengthen community health councils has been on the agenda in Wales for some time. Hon. Members referred to that earlier today and particularly to work carried out by the patient advisory and support working group, which suggested that there was strong support for community health councils in Wales and for strengthening their role and remit. The Welsh Affairs Committee has been helpful in following that through and giving us its comments and advice.<br><br>
We propose to make community health councils in Wales an essential element in our wider strategy for involving the public in health service planning and delivery and, as hon. Members have said, of listening to their views and concerns. Many community health councils are close to their local communities and already do much good work in representing them. We want to build on that by giving them new powers and making them even more visible and able to act on behalf of their communities.<br><br>
The independence that community health councils rightly cherish will be maintained, but we shall also put in place mechanisms to ensure that they deliver the same standards to their communities, wherever they are in Wales. The establishment of the Wales Centre for Health originated from the document "Better Health Better Wales", which was produced by the Welsh Office in 1998. The centre forms part of the new structures that will take forward the aims of the Government and the Assembly for improving health and well-being and reducing health inequalities in Wales. It will strengthen public health capability and capacity in Wales.<br><br>
As the Welsh Affairs Committee recognised, its independence is crucial and its role in advising the Assembly, as well as agencies, voluntary organisations and the public, will be greatly valued. It will work with academics and public sector expertise, support training and encourage collaboration between different sectors and professional disciplines.<br><br>
The creation of a body to replace the former Welsh National Board for Nursing and Midwifery was a commitment given my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) when he was Secretary of State for Health in the days of the first Labour Government in 1997. Health Professions Wales will perform the functions of the WNB that have not been transferred to the new UK-wide body. That will assist in the ongoing development of a work force that will have the appropriate skills and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
knowledge to deliver a safe and effective service in all parts of Wales. It will also work in partnership with the Care Council for Wales to ensure that there is cooperation and co-ordination on skill requirements where professional groups work across boundaries.<br><br>
The pre-legislative scrutiny process has been useful, and we are considering all the responses and comments that we have had from a range of organisations and individuals including, of course, the report by the Welsh Affairs Committee, and the debate has been very useful.<br><br>
If I may, I shall respond to comments made by Members in today's debate. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South because he has made an important contribution. His speech at the start of today's debate set the scene for our deliberations, and he took us through the list of individuals and organisations that gave evidence to the Committee. Having touched on a number of the Committee's recommendations, he said that the draft Bill would ensure that patients were in control, which is the objective of the Government and the Assembly for reforms to the health service. He also took the view that draft Bills should be produced like Green Papers with combined objectives and explanatory notes, which is obviously something that we can consider because I emphasise that the pre-legislative scrutiny of draft Bills is a new process. We are gaining experience all the time and the deliberations that we have had in recent weeks will inform our decisions on where we take the Bill in future.<br><br>
The Welsh Affairs Committee made 22 recommendations, some of which I shall touch on in a moment, including ones made by my hon. Friend on NHS staff taking time off to carry out duties on CHCs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caernarfon welcomed the opportunity to consider legislation in draft form. He expressed his hope that that would be the pattern for the future and spent most of the rest of his time talking about matters totally unrelated to the draft legislation. I do not want to suggest that the matters about which he spoke are unimportant—waiting lists are a very important issue and waiting list figures have been broadly disappointing. However, I have to tell him that the Government—we are working in partnership with our colleagues in the National Assembly—are seeking to put right 18 years of under-investment during which we saw massive cuts in doctors, nurses and hospital beds. I remind him that although he was not here his party was in the House of Commons at that time and sustained the then Tory Government and helped to keep them in office for longer than they should have been.<br><br>
However, I fully concur with the hon. Gentleman's remarks on NHS staff, whom he praised, because they do a marvellous job. I also share the welcome that he gave to extra spending on the NHS. He was worried about further structural changes that the health service will undergo as a result of the passage of the National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002.1 can tell him that the Act will create 22 local health boards, which will replace the 22 existing local health groups. The 15 health trusts that already exist
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
will continue to do so, and the proposed 12 partnerships covered in the arrangement in the Bill will employ no staff, have no offices and only affect existing relationships. I had better not stray too far or you will pull me back, Mr. Griffiths, to talk about matters relating to the draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill.<br><br>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman raised an issue concerning the use of the Welsh language. I share his concern and can tell him that I have asked lawyers to discuss with parliamentary counsel whether it would be appropriate to bring health professions in Wales in line with the other two provisions in the Bill by making express reference to the Welsh Language Act 1993. We shall reflect on his comments on that matter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gower said that he would have liked more time to consider the draft Bill, and I hope that that can be accommodated if we bring through future legislation. He and others, including my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central and the hon. Members for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price), for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)—he did not make a contribution on that—and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik) all referred to the coterminosity issue, which clearly divides leading Members of Plaid Cymru, as we have just witnessed. CHCs are largely coterminous and my colleague Jane Hutt, the Assembly Minister with responsibility for health, takes the view that she does not wish to make further changes on the coterminosity issue. I will consult with her when we prepare for the Bill and will ensure that the points that have been made in the debate will form part of our discussion when we consider whether we can do anything else.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gower spoke about extending the role of CHCs, which was also touched on by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr. Broadly speaking, I am satisfied with the proposals in the draft legislation, but I shall certainly take on board the points in the report and have further wide-ranging discussions before reaching any final conclusions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gower spoke about the role of the Association of Welsh Community Health Councils. I should make it clear that its role will be supportive and regulatory. It will move from being a support organisation for CHCs to one with a line management role for CHC chief officers. My colleague the Assembly Minister for Health and Social Services is already consulting on those proposals.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said that a great majority of the national health service performed well, but the Bill offered an opportunity to make improvements. I certainly agree with that. He welcomed the evolution of CHCs as proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North made a considered contribution. Her knowledge and experience of CHCs and children's issues in particular was much in evidence in her remarks. She said that the Bill was short. She is right, but elements of our overall reform package have already been dealt with in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley said that this was a historic day as far as pre-legislative scrutiny is concerned, and he was absolutely right. He also explained how Members in another place were more fully involved in pre-legislative scrutiny. We will take that insight on board. The Secretary of State is meeting Members in the other place later this evening, and I am sure that the matter will be discussed. We will consider how that can be improved in the future.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley and my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) mentioned the importance of sharing best practice throughout the United Kingdom. I agree that that is important. Any form of audit or inspection that we eventually carry out must take account of the differences across the UK so that best practice can be taken on board.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd also raised the issue of costs, particularly of local health boards, which were dealt with in a previous Bill. To help members of the Committee, I shall give some indication of the cost forecast for the changes. Currently, £1.8 million is spent on delivery of CHC services. It is estimated that a further £660,000 will be needed as a result of the changes and restructuring. Of that £660,000, about £480,000 will go on the new advocacy responsibilities, which we all welcome, bringing the total spend to about £2.46 million.<br><br>
Health Professions Wales will cost about £1.5 million, but that money will come from a budget that is already used by the WNB and that will be transferred to the Assembly, which is temporarily carrying out the responsibility. It will feed through to Health Professions Wales. We guesstimate that the cost of the Wales Centre for Health will be about £600,000, which will come from existing resources that the Assembly has already taken into account.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned a newspaper article in which a surgeon was quoted on problems in the health service. I entirely agree that there are difficulties, and it is right that we listen to those who work at the coal face. However, many surgeons would make a greater contribution to the health service if they spent more time working in it and less time in private practice. Members of all parties share that view.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central welcomed the greater scrutiny role for CHCs, and I believe that that is good. His very good example of why it is necessary was about a whistleblower in his constituency who has apparently suffered discrimination. I hope that the enhanced powers that CHCs will be given will help overcome such difficulties.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) spoke about the value of pre-legislative scrutiny and made an interesting proposal for a Special Standing Committee, which we might consider in future. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire spoke warmly about the pre-legislative

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
scrutiny process. I thank him for his comments. Indeed, I thank the leaders of all the Opposition parties. We had discussions with them about the process before we undertook it and have had great support from all parties. The hon. Gentleman also felt that we should allow the National Assembly and local people to have more of a say. The legislation will help with that. He referred to the need for CHC members to receive appropriate training, and I agree with him.<br><br>
I am conscious of the time, Mr. Griffiths. My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd paid tribute to the work of the Chairman and members of the Select Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly spoke of the constitutional significance of such pre-legislative scrutiny but reminded us that, in partnership with Assembly colleagues, this place has a very important role to play in respect of legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore referred to the pre-legislative process and recognised that such draft legislation was valuable.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) spoke about his professional background in the national health service and the particular insights that that had given him. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr said that he should have liked to see a proposal in the draft Bill for a separate Welsh audit body. Discussions are taking place between the Wales Office, the National Assembly and the Department of Health on how to establish an audit of the health service in Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I should like to touch on a few more points in the Bill and on comments from hon. Members. The eleventh recommendation requested
<br><blockquote><p>"publication in the Bill of provisions on the obligations of providers of health services to supply information to CHCs."</p></blockquote>
We recognise that not including those was an oversight, and they will be included in the Bill. In the tenth recommendation, the Committee requested a clear explanation of
<br><blockquote><p>"paragraph (3) of Schedule 7A, and in particular … sub-paragraphs (g) and (h)".</p></blockquote>
We will ensure that our position is explained more closely and clearly in the final explanatory notes accompanying the Bill.<br><br>
In its twentieth recommendation, the Committee suggested that a redrafting of clause 4(1) would ensure that functions were not conferred on Health Professions Wales by direction. We accept that. My colleague, Jane Hutt, the Assembly Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
responsible, made it clear that the Assembly would go through a process of full consultation and not direction.<br><br>
The seventh recommendation is to allow CHC members statutory time off to work for their public duties. We do not consider that the Bill would be the appropriate vehicle for that measure because it would create an offence with criminal connotations, in a health Bill. However, I support the Committee's view, and I shall write to my colleagues in Government to see what can be done to change legislation.<br><br>
The report makes no recommendations on smoking, but evidence on the subject came up in the Committee's findings. We do not consider that the Bill is appropriate for providing rules on smoking in public places, but we take such comments on board. Any rules will be a matter for wider legislation.<br><br>
It may help if I say that I shall respond more widely, with the Secretary of State, after we have considered all comments from various organisations and individuals. The majority of the comments from the Committee's evidence will receive considerable deliberation. It would not be appropriate for me to be over-specific in giving a response now because I do not want to pre-judge anyone else's comments; all remarks should be considered in the round.<br><br>
The Government have valued the experience that the draft Bill has provided. It is the first time that I have been involved as a Minister, or even as Member of the House, in pre-legislative scrutiny. The process will help to produce an effective Bill. When I was an Opposition Member, I introduced a whistleblowers Bill, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill, which was killed off by the Conservative party. I wonder whether that would have benefited from wider scrutiny if it had been available at the time. I hope to embrace the new process as a way of looking ahead to legislation, because when hon. Members from all parties have an opportunity to scrutinise legislation the Executive can produce better Bills.<br><br>
I am most grateful for the work done by the Welsh Affairs Committee and to colleagues who have taken part in today's discussion. We have made a major contribution to a good piece of legislation, which I hope will be introduced in the next Session. It will benefit Wales, its people and its health service.</span></p>
