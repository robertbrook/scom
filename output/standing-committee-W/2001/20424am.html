	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to call as many hon. Members who have tabled questions as possible. I therefore ask that all hon. Members ask brief supplementary questions and that Ministers give concise answers, as I am sure that they will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State was asked—</i></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Postal Services</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What discussions he has had with Whitehall colleagues and the First Secretary of the National Assembly concerning the effects of the Postcomm proposals for competition on postal services in Wales; and if he will make a statement. [49433]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Postcomm's document "Proposals for effective competition in UK postal services", which was issued on 31 January, has been subject to public consultation, and the Government have consistently encouraged stakeholders to make their views known to Postcomm. We would expect Postcomm to take due account of all the views expressed and to consider their implications. We will obviously follow those discussions closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his answer. In the past few months, the Pontypridd and Wrexham parcel depots have been closed. The rural postal network is under threat, and Postcomm's proposals have put the jobs of ordinary working people in the Post Office at risk. Yet I note from an answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) that the Secretary of State has received no correspondence from Consignia and held no meetings with it in the past 12 months. Given the threat to the Welsh postal service, should he not have taken a more active interest in the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, I have had lots of meetings, including with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. I have also discussed the matter with the Minister of State at that Department, the First Minister and the general and regional secretaries of the Communication Workers Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is, of course, aware that the present situation cannot continue, because Consignia is losing about £1.5 million a day. There must be a more efficient service, and I hope that Consignia's new chief executive—I shall try to ensure that we meet him, as the hon. Gentleman suggested—and the trade unions will work together to provide a decent postal service in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my right hon. Friend's attention to a letter that I received from Posten, the Swedish state postal service through my interest in the issue? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Competition in our case has acted as a spur for increased efficiency and innovation, and has led to considerable benefits for Swedish postal service users."</p></blockquote>
Will my right hon. Friend bear it in mind that, despite such assurances from other state-owned postal services, there are genuine concerns about jobs and the postal network? Will he continue to take those up with the DTI?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will. I understand that there are special circumstances in Wales, not least in rural areas. However, if the situation has become so bad that Consignia is losing huge amounts of money, the point is surely to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning Sweden, because there is no doubt that competition will improve the efficiency of services. At the same time, however, we must do our best to safeguard jobs. The postal service has been hugely important for many decades, but something has gone wrong if so much money is being lost. Of course we want a universal postal service and to safeguard our rural networks, but the present situation cannot continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Steel Industry</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Dr. Hywel Francis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on the safeguards introduced by the European Union to protect the Welsh steel industry following the recent introduction of tariffs by the United States of America. [49434]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will stand by our steel industry and communities in combating the unjustified and deeply regrettable action by the United States. We pressed for, and welcome, the introduction from 29 March of provisional safeguard measures to protect European Union industry against diversion of trade from the United States. We also fully support the European Commission in initiating World Trade Organisation action against the United States. May I add that I know that my hon. Friend has worked very hard on the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Francis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his reply. He will know that the all-party parliamentary group on steel has recently been established and has met with widespread support in both Houses. Many Welsh Members of all parties have been prominent in establishing that group. Will the Secretary of State meet members of the group to discuss ways of safeguarding the industry and its communities in Wales, to reaffirm the principles of free and fair trade and to ensure that we avoid sliding into a state of economic nationalism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I will give that commitment. I am a member of the all-party group on steel, so, in a sense, I will be meeting myself. Some weeks ago, the First Minister and I met Dr. Bodman, the United States Deputy Secretary for Commerce, when he visited Cardiff, and we impressed on him the

	<div class='title'>Tourism</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When he last met the First Secretary to discuss proposals to assist the Welsh tourism industry.[49435]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with the First Minister and other Assembly Ministers on a range of issues including the tourism industry in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The year 2001 was very difficult, to say the least, for Welsh tourism, with both foot and mouth and the tragic events of 11 September. I therefore welcome the new £10 million advertising campaign of the Wales Tourist Board, its biggest ever campaign, which will boost the number of visitors to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply, but I have to say that many people who operate in the industry do not believe that the Government give them sufficient assistance. I know that the budget is constrained, but tourism is a very important industry in Wales, so I ask the Minister again to redouble his efforts to ensure that, in partnership with the National Assembly for Wales, we can develop further the great potential for tourism. Tourism is now probably the biggest employer in Wales, and it offers not poor seasonal jobs, but good jobs when it is done properly and sustainably. I urge the Minister to do what he can to strengthen the economy by assisting the tourism industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance because as I have travelled around Wales, including the hon. Gentleman's beautiful constituency, in the past few months, I have been impressed by the efforts of the tourism industry to combat the problems that it has faced. I was especially impressed by the number of people in his constituency who offer not seasonal jobs, but employment throughout the year. That is the sort of investment we want. The Wales Tourist Board, the objective 1 projects and the Assembly have put about £30 million into projects to develop tourism, but the Government will continue to give as much support as possible to the Assembly, because tourism is a vital industry in Wales. We have a good story to tell about visiting Wales and we will do all that we can, working with everyone possible, to say, "Come to Wales. It's a great place for a holiday."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the actions of members of Cymuned over the Easter bank holiday, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) and bordering on the constituency of the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams), were disgraceful? Whatever the Government and the National Assembly do to promote tourism in Wales, such actions do not help. Last weekend, we saw graffiti in the constituency of the hon. Member for Caernarfon, saying, "Cymru i'r Cymry. English go home." What does that do for the tourist industry in Wales, which was on its knees last year as a result of foot-and-mouth disease?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every decent Welshman and woman would condemn the actions of Cymuned. People in Wales are not inward looking. Wales has a great story to tell about its industry, including tourism, and it is important that all of us show the good face of Wales. Anyone who says, for any sort of political advantage, that there is anything wrong in bringing English people into Wales is totally wrong. We reject that. We in the Labour party are internationalists and socialists, and we believe that Wales should be opened up to everyone. It is important that all of us who are elected to public office stand as one in condemning actions and statements such as those that my hon. Friend described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[49436]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I have regular meetings with the First Secretary to discuss a range of issues including the provision of housing. Affordable housing has been, and continues to be, a high priority for the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that house prices in my constituency have rocketed over the past 12 months? They have gone up even faster than the Labour party's spending on the national health service. Families find it increasingly difficult to afford houses and the council and housing associations to provide affordable housing for rent in Cardiff. Will he agree to liaise with Government colleagues and the First Secretary to examine ways of ensuring that the affordability of housing in urban areas is given greater policy priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Affordable housing is an issue in both urban and rural areas. My colleagues in the Assembly have made available £51 million of social housing grant to help local authorities to increase the availability of housing stock. It is important to continue to do that, because for many people a house is their biggest purchase. We must ensure that affordable housing is available. It is difficult even in conurbations such as Cardiff, which attract huge inward investment, to make sure that we can deliver what my hon. Friend is asking for. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I will work with our colleagues in the Assembly to do everything possible to make affordable housing available in cities such as Cardiff, as well as in the rural parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that the one thing that is rising faster than house prices in Cardiff, West is the council tax on those houses? Does he appreciate that when the Labour party came to power, the council tax in Cardiff was £486, whereas today it is £691? What discussions is he having with the Secretaries of the Welsh Assembly to find out what is going wrong? Will he now take some of the responsibility for the fact that people are paying council taxes that have risen by more than one third during the past four years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Council tax rises are a matter for local authorities. I served on a local authority for 20 years

and took that responsibility very seriously. However, if the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that councils are doing something wrong by raising council taxes, will he tell us which services should be cut—education, social services, transport, meals on wheels? Let him tell us. We have heard many times in the Welsh Grand Committee and in debates in the Chamber that Conservative policy is to cut, cut and cut public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

[49437]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meet the First Secretary regularly to discuss a range of issues, including progress with the objective 1 programme. Responsibility for that programme lies with the National Assembly. I am advised by Assembly colleagues that, at 21 March, over 800 objective 1 projects had been approved, worth a total of over £340 million in European grants. More than £78 million of objective 1 grants has already been paid out by the Assembly. It is not for me or for Assembly Ministers to ensure the success of individual projects. Objective 1 funding is administered via a competitive bidding process, which ensures that all worthy projects have equal access to funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will know that approval for objective 1 projects is only the first step. Making them work requires a partnership approach. I am sure that he will be as disappointed as I am that the apprentice training project at Aberporth in my constituency has suffered a body blow due to the recent withdrawal of MOD funding. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity to progress that project if we can persuade the private company that is connected with it to become more involved and to work with Education and Learning Wales and the other agencies in order to keep apprentice training and an objective 1 project in Aberporth. Does the Secretary of State share my disappointment that ConnectIT is prepared to continue training in Boscombe down in England, due, according to its response to a union official, to the more central location? Does he share my concern that if private companies have that kind of attitude, we shall not be able to create any jobs through objective 1 in rural Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not necessarily agree with the pessimism expressed by the hon. Gentleman at the end of his question, but I entirely agree with him otherwise. I had fruitful meetings with the First Minister, and with ELWa and ConnectIT in Cardiff and London some time ago. We have been in correspondence and held meetings on the subject, and I am glad that the Assembly is looking to consider projects that will plug the gap left by the decision to withdraw apprentice training. As to Boscombe down, I was not aware of the details. I shall consider those matters and come back to the hon. Gentleman with more details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be aware that the strategic review of education in Monmouthshire has exposed the fact that a number of schools are being closed in the Abergavenny area. One of the reasons is the number of surplus places, but that is a function of class size. To the credit of the National Assembly, Jane Davidson has indicated that class sizes in primary schools will be reduced to 25 pupils per class. Will my hon. Friend urge the First Minister and the National Assembly to pursue the policy of 25 pupils per class in the primary sector in order to reduce concerns about surplus places, and thereby increase the level and provision of education for all our young children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the Monmouthshire local education authority is currently conducting a review of education provision in the area, especially in Abergavenny. The LEA is required by statute to consult widely on proposals for altering education provision. In the event of statutory objections being made when the LEA publishes its proposals, the Assembly's Minister for Education and Lifelong Learning will have the final decision. In my experience as a councillor, I have had difficulties and problems with closed schools, so I fully understand my hon. Friend's point.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise that this is a particularly tough time for manufacturers in the United Kingdom, due to the slowdown in the world economy and the weakness of the euro.

That is reflected in all constituencies in Wales. There have been job increases in my hon. Friend's constituency; National Britannia, Independent Community Living, B and Q, Creditsafe UK Ltd. and others have brought jobs to Caerphilly. I understand my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the whole Committee will want to welcome this enormous boost to the Welsh economy. It is one of the biggest investments in aerospace for some time and will make DARA one of the biggest aerospace employers in Wales. It will result in the building of one of the most modern hangars in the world, capable of servicing up to 47 fighter aircraft and other military aircraft, including Lynx and Chinook helicopters.

	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chancellor's Budget announcements last Wednesday contained a number of incentives for renewable energy. They include enhanced capital allowances for business investment in energy saving technologies; exemption from the climate change levy for combined heat and power and coal mine methane projects; the first economy-wide emissions trading scheme; a fuel duty differential for sulphur free petrol and diesel; a fuel duty exemption for hydrogen; lower duty for bio-diesel; and a commitment to review the potential use of economic instruments to tackle household energy efficiency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Lucas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list that my hon. Friend has outlined confirms the Chancellor's commitment to renewable energy. Wales's manufacturing industry, a tradition of which we are very proud, should treat the renewables obligation and the target of 10 per cent. of energy being produced from renewable sources by 2010 as a manufacturing opportunity. We should use it to ensure that we make products in Wales for industry and the domestic market, securing a firm manufacturing base for the future. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made the commitment. Is it not right that industry in Wales should see that as an opportunity and seize it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that industry will see it as an opportunity. Indeed, I would commend to my hon. Friend and to industry in Wales a very good company in my constituency that designs and manufactures solar heating systems, which are very efficient for both housing and industrial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, as we know from the performance and innovation unit report, to consider renewables as a major source of energy during the next 25 years. The debate on that report is now taking place and I hope that everybody will join in. We can make progress with that, particularly in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Within Britain, Wales is even more fortunate in being able to produce even larger amounts in proportion to its land mass. This is an opportunity for Wales.

However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Indeed, I have seen an exciting project off Rhyl Flats—an energy generating project that is well worth looking at. That will all form part of the debate that we are having following the PIU report.

I very much welcome the indications from the Wales Tourist Board that attractions, accommodation providers and tourist centres across Wales have received a great many visitors over the Easter bank holiday weekend and since.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have received encouraging messages from tourist operators that they had a good Easter, boosted by the good weather that we experienced. None the less, there is concern about the future in the tourist industry, especially in businesses operating outside objective 1 and 2 areas. People are particularly worried about the way in which state aid rules affect the operation of the rural recovery fund and objective 2, inasmuch as individuals and organisations cannot receive more than £60,000-worth of public support over a three-year period.

At the last Welsh Question Time, the Secretary of State said that he would receive a delegation from people operating objective 2. Before then, will he take the opportunity to talk to colleagues in the Assembly about the operation of state aid rules?

[49443]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend and I meet ministerial colleagues regularly to discuss a range of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have no plans to extend the UK coal operating aid scheme beyond July 2002. The scheme was established to assist certain parts of the coal industry to overcome short-term market problems such as the lifting of certain restrictions on building gas-fired power stations, the introduction of NET A—the New Electricity Trading Arrangement—and historically low international coal prices. These issues should no longer be placing direct pressure on production. A mid-2002 end to the scheme is therefore entirely consistent with scheme objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is aware that the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty expires on 23 July, but that a new treaty will unfortunately not be in place by that time. The Commission has allowed all coal-producing countries to extend the scheme until the end of the year while a new treaty is negotiated. The only member state that refuses to extend the scheme is the United Kingdom, despite the Government's previous statement that they wanted a level playing field.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No final decisions have been taken on coal state aids in the European Union. Negotiation on a new European framework is, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, still under way. Our Government's

position has been to continue to press for flexibility to pay suitable types of aid, investment aid in particular, should that be appropriate. I am aware of the hon.

	<div class='title'>Budget Statement</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Budget Statement and its implications for Wales.</p></blockquote>
Before I start the debate, Mr. Griffiths, it would be entirely wrong at this meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee not to mention Sir Ray Powell. Since we last met, Sir Ray has died, and we have all, quite rightly, paid our tributes to him in various ways and in different places. He assiduously attended this Committee—those of us who recall years past will remember that he always started proceedings with a rigorous and robust point of order on some issue that, generally speaking, had no relationship to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, Sir Ray would have made specific reference to the fact that it is far too hot in this Committee Room. He raised exactly that matter on a point of order some years ago, after which he walked out, although I am not recommending that course of action to hon. Members here today. He was a great character and he will be missed by Members of Parliament and by his constituents. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) will take back to Sir Ray's family and friends the condolences of members of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is now nearly a week old, but it is still important that Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies are able to get together in a forum such as this Committee to talk about the Budget and its implications for the people whom we now represent jointly with the Members of the National Assembly for Wales. I begin by referring to the enormous change, which was mentioned during questions, in the economic fortunes of Wales in the past few years. Everything that flows from the Budget, whether increases in public services or methods of helping families, has been possible only because of the strong economic policies that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government have introduced during the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the year that has elapsed between the last time the Welsh Grand Committee met to consider Budget implications for Wales and today's meeting, the events of 11 September have occurred. I do not think that any country in the world, let alone Europe, has sustained itself economically and financially as well as we have done. We have done so only because of the strength of economic policy. Because of the measures introduced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, we have one of the strongest and most robust economies in the western world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our economy is growing by some 2.25 per cent. a year—the fastest growth in any G7 economy. There is strong consumer demand, which I see when I go around Wales and talk to different companies. Perhaps the greatest success story, which was touched on earlier by hon. Members, is something that we in Wales might take too much for granted. Every single one of us can recall that in our constituencies in the mid-1990s, and indeed later
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
than that, unemployment was a disgrace. Thousands and thousands of people, particularly young people, had been cast on to the dole queues with no hope for the future. That has been turned around in the most dramatic way in modern political history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Look at the figures: there are 1.5 million more people in work in the United Kingdom than there were in spring 1997. Unemployment in Wales is at its lowest for 27 years. That is a remarkable achievement. Everything we do in terms of spending on public services or on the economy in general has to be measured against that backcloth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the new deal has been enormously successful in each of our constituencies. The reason why it has been so successful is that whereas once there were millions of people out of work to whom the Government had to pay unemployment benefit and from whom we did not get tax revenues, we have been able to put people into work, with the result that we have not had to spend money on unemployment benefits and we have retained tax revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is coupled with the way in which the Chancellor has coped with the problem of national debt. We are paying only 31 per cent. of gross domestic product towards national debt, compared with 44 per cent. in 1997. This year, we have paid £8 billion less in interest repayments than in 1997–98. The billions of pounds derived from savings on unemployment benefits and reductions in debt interest have gone into our public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why, before we consider the questions raised by last week's Budget statement, we should read today's headline in the 	<i>Western Mail's</i> "Business Wales" section: "Increase in optimism revealed by survey". The 	<i>Western Mail</i> and other newspapers have been saying for the past few weeks that in Wales optimism and public confidence in the economy in general, and manufacturing industry in particular, have, despite what happened on 11 September, risen to an all-time high over the past few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is reflected in our constituencies. We have, of course, had setbacks, not least in my constituency, which has traditionally been based on coal and steel. We have had problems with Corus, where 3,000 jobs disappeared. Other manufacturing jobs have also disappeared, but we have not been alone in Europe or the world in suffering a decline in certain manufacturing industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of setbacks, does my right hon. Friend agree that the decision made yesterday by AMP to close its offices in Cardiff with the loss of 300 jobs, which are to be relocated to Peterborough and Tunbridge Wells, is yet another example of companies closing down branches and relocating headquarters? Better value for money would be obtained by transferring workers from Tunbridge Wells to Cardiff rather than the other way around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that and very much regret what has occurred, especially given my hon. Friend's constituency interest. It is, as they say, highly regrettable. However, he would probably agree that many firms are doing that in reverse—coming from

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
England to my constituency and others—and when companies relocate to Wales, Members of Parliament for English constituencies would say the same thing as he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that individual case is, at the end of the day, a blow, when we consider the overall picture and the amazing fact that there are more people at work today in Wales than there were at this time last year, we see proof that our policies are working despite the loss of manufacturing jobs that has gone on in between. We are ensuring that people do not go on to the dole queues. Now, through the new deal and other schemes, young people are going on to real jobs in the business sector, the service sector and so on—not just in manufacturing, although I understand my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Wales have to look at the Budget against the backcloth of what has happened to unemployment and jobs in our constituencies. To that end, last week, the Chancellor talked about ensuring that enterprise in Wales prospers. We will give special help to small companies in Wales because of the staggering fact that 98 per cent. of Welsh companies are small and medium-sized enterprises, which between them employ more than 500,000 people in Wales. Of course, there are some big companies that will benefit from the research and development tax credit for large companies. That will benefit about 50 large companies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bulk of our constituents do not work in big companies. The corporation tax cuts in the Budget will benefit 19,000 small companies, 6,000 of which will pay no corporation tax at all. Every member of the Committee will welcome the simplification of the VAT rules, which will benefit about 40,000 Welsh companies in their dealings with VAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is right to say that the small and medium-sized companies sector is very important in Wales, but I do not know of many incorporated companies that trade on profit of less than £10,000 a year and employ people. Such firms are normally small partnerships. It may sound good, but in fact it is of little consequence to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To say that the measures are of little consequence to Wales is entirely wrong. The hon. Gentleman may well be right in saying that there are other companies that fall outside the definitions, but the figures that I just gave—almost 20,000 companies in a country of only 3 million people—mean that an enormous number of people will benefit from those packages. He must add to that the measures introduced in the pre-Budget report abolishing stamp duty in the majority of wards in Wales. The community investment tax credit scheme will give help to small companies in Wales to ensure that they prosper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that all the benefits that accrued to businesses during the Budget statement were completely undone by the increase in employers' national insurance rates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I do not accept that. Business is never going to be exempted from paying taxation or national insurance. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I that the companies to which I have just referred benefited in other ways. They have benefited even more during the past few years. I will address later remarks to the question of why national insurance has been increased. However, in terms of overall taxation of businesses and individuals, the hon. Gentleman is aware that of all the major economies in Europe, ours is the least taxed. However, there is another very important principle that we must observe, which is that businesses must play their part in ensuring that we have decent public services, including health services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has talked a great deal about companies and corporation tax. Does he accept that not only are 98 per cent. of companies small and medium-sized businesses, but the vast majority of those who run them are self-employed? It is the self-employed who drive the economy in a rural area such as mine. What does the Budget offer self-employed business people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has already answered that question. In the operation of a small business, it is important that the paperwork involved in VAT is reduced. Small business men and women talk to me about those issues, and I am sure that they will welcome the benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of being accused of not being very nice, does my right hon. Friend find the intervention of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)—who is a very nice chap—rather strange? I have just checked 	<i>Hansard</i> and noticed that last night he voted in favour of the increase in national insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no answer to that, but I agree that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire is a very nice chap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said earlier that the people of Wales were now the lowest taxed compared to other European Union countries. Is he including stealth taxes, which are indirect taxes, or just income tax? If both, please will he tell us on what survey or analysis he bases his assessment? I understand that the combination of stealth and income taxes makes us the highest taxed country in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is the expert on stealth taxes, as the Conservative Government were responsible for 22 tax increases. Well before he became a Member of Parliament, I spent months and months in this Room debating the poll tax. We do not need to talk too much about taxation and the record of the hon. Gentleman's party. I stand by what I said about direct taxation on the individual.

As well as helping businesses and enterprise, the Budget has helped all those families that, jointly, we represent in the House of Commons. The new child tax credit and the working tax credit will help 350,000 Welsh families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman rises to welcome the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed I do welcome it—it is a good move. However, I rise to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan). The Liberal Democrats support additional investment in the health service, but my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire was pointing out that it would have been fairer to increase income tax. Surely, there is a responsibility to support the national health service directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I therefore assume that the hon. Gentleman wants pensioners in Wales to pay an increase in income tax, because that is what would happen if we had put the increase on income tax. I make no apology for saying that there is a duty on businesses as well as on individuals to ensure that in Wales there are decent public services, particularly health services. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I that businesses lose billions of pounds every year because of inadequate health services in different parts of the country. That is why a decent health service is as important to a business as it is to an individual or family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Lucas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who ran a small business before entering Parliament, I believe that two of the most important things for small businesses are low interest rates and stability, from both of which businesses have benefited hugely since Labour came to power. We must consider against that backcloth the responsibilities of business to take part in funding our great national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. Our strong, robust economy places far less of a burden on business than the boom and bust of the Conservative years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving way a second time. I wish to press him on employers' national insurance contributions. Plaid Cymru accepts the central point that the health service is a national burden that should be borne by everyone—workers and employers—in the UK. However, the national insurance increase will have a real effect on public services. Has the Secretary of State seen the research that shows that, for every £100 extra going to the national health service because of the Budget, £3 will be taken back through employers' national insurance increases? Surely, there is a case for exempting public services from the increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that principle. Public services have to pay in the same way that private business pays. That has always been a fundamental element of the way in which public services help to finance Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my right hon. Friend realises that what has just been proposed would exempt Members of Parliament from paying the increase. Is that what the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) was suggesting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly another aspect of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
As well as the child tax credit and the working tax credit, my hon. Friends and others will know that increases in child benefit will benefit 360,000 Welsh families. Some Opposition Members should reflect on the facts that the minimum wage is to go up to £4.20 an hour from October, and that 80,000 Welsh people, 70 per cent. of whom are women, will benefit from that. Had it been left to the Opposition, we would not have the minimum wage. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The trouble is that the public memory on some such things is too easily wiped away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is a very good thing that the child tax credit is now to be paid to the main carer, which reflects a recognition of the responsibilities of caring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree. That will be especially important to single parent families and others in Wales who desperately want to work. The great benefit of welfare to work is that people who never thought of working in days gone by can now make their contribution to society. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be said that, during the past year or two, not only have children benefited from the Government's actions, but so have the pensioners that we jointly represent. Let us look at the figures: some 250,000 pensioner households in Wales will benefit from the pension credit, which is to operate from next year; the minimum income guarantee helps 100,000 people in Wales; free television licences help 200,000 households in Wales; and winter fuel payments help 465,000 people in Wales. Those are staggering statistics. Pensioners in Wales are far better off than they ever were under Conservative Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main thrust of the Budget, as everyone knows, is our public services. The economic strength that we have built up will be used to ensure that we recreate those public services, in particular, the national health service. It is important to remember that in a few months, we, the Welsh Grand Committee, will consider the spending review that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce in the summer. He has already said that public services and other aspects of Government policy will be improved by extra spending. For the details, we await the publication in July of the spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very generous of the Secretary of State to give way to me a second time. Will he comment on the current edition of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy guide to local government finance? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Wales, Local Authority Spending has fallen … in real terms between 1995 and 2001"</p></blockquote>
there has been
	<br><blockquote><p>"a percentage reduction of 0.6 per cent."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that net capital spending fell in the same period by 40.7 per cent., capital grants by 20.5 per cent. and gross capital expenditure by 15 per cent., but that in the corresponding period in England, spending in all those areas increased. There is a huge amount to be done in public services, for which our constituents are paying through the nose. Despite all the good things in the Budget, they will be paying far more council tax in the coming months and years. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
afraid that that will eat away at all the benefits that the Secretary of State has mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that the Welsh Local Government Association said this year that it thought that the settlement it received was an extremely generous one. He also knows that matters such as council tax and local government spending in Wales are now devolved. His comparisons with England reflect the fact that, in Wales, those are matters for the National Assembly and the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the commitment to public services that was given in the Budget statement, does my right hon. Friend agree that one public service that is often forgotten is defence? Does he welcome the Chancellor's remarks about defence—I refer to questions of defence investment—not only because of their implications for Wales, but because under the Labour Government Britain leads the world in peacekeeping, conflict avoidance and humanitarian support, which are possible only with the proper resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I welcome those remarks because of their particular relevance to my hon. Friend's constituency and because of the more general point that as a member of the United Nations Security Council we have a role in ensuring that there is peace in the world. We have another role in helping poorer countries, which has been well fulfilled by my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for International Development and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Britain has been very successful in those roles, which is a great credit to the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to domestic public services and what the Chancellor said about the national health service. Of course, people from Wales have a particular interest in the NHS, not least because a Welshman—indeed, a Monmouthshire man—founded it. He did so the year I was born—in fact, I believe I was a national health service baby, although it was a very long time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nye Bevan would have been extremely proud of the Budget, because it means that greater resources than ever before are being given to the health service in the United Kingdom and consequentially to Wales. That is a striking achievement, because the last spending review also gave the health service a bigger increase than ever before. Today we are talking about what will happen in the next few years, but if hon. Members cast their minds back to when the Committee met some years ago to discuss another spending review, they will remember that an extra £1 billion was given to the NHS in Wales at that time. This year, an additional £49 million over and above planned expenditure has gone to the Welsh health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enormity of the new proposals in the Budget is staggering. Let me remind the Committee what they mean for the Welsh health service. Next year, £128 million extra will go to the NHS; the year after that, £493 million more will be spent than is being spent now; the year after that, £907 million more, and the year after that £1,348 million more. In the final year, £1,844 million more will be spent than is spent now, so
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
in 2007–08, £5.681 billion could be spent on the health service in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an enormous increase, but we are talking about a large amount even for this year. Currently, the National Assembly spends £3.6 billion on the NHS in Wales. As I have said, in 2007–08, almost £6 billion could be spent. There is a potential health spending increase of 58 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that over that period the NHS budget in England will increase at an annual average real rate of 7.5 per cent. Will the Secretary of State give the corresponding figure for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman well knows that the rate of increase in England is different from that in Wales. The actual—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Higher or lower?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that Wales starts from a higher base. That is the reason—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] These comments are coming from members of a party that would not have a penny to spend on health if Wales left the United Kingdom. Do they really think that extra money to the extent that I have outlined would be spent on the health service in Wales if there were an independent Welsh state? Of course it would not. That would be impossible. People in Wales know full well that the enormous increase in spending on the health service in Wales has come about because we are part of the United Kingdom and have a Labour Government that are courageous enough to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hywel Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State plainly tell us how much lower spending in Wales is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that spending in Wales on the health service in terms of the percentage growth of the United Kingdom was, on average, 7.4 per cent. in real terms each year. In the last 20 years, it was 3.6 per cent. The consequentials mean that Wales can increase its health spending by 6.8 per cent. He also knows that if Wales wanted to match the percentage growth of the United Kingdom, it would find extra from the block. However, Wales has received the same increase per head as the rest of the United Kingdom. That is the point. He knows as well as I do that the basis on which that is predicated is much higher spending on health because of what a Labour Government have given the Welsh pot. It is as simple as that. As much as the Welsh National party whinges and grumbles about what has happened, in reality no one can believe it on the issue. It knows that it could never in a million years match the spending that we have given the Welsh people, because they are part of the United Kingdom, and have a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plaid Cymru Members have made much play about the future funding for the NHS in Wales compared with England. In Wales, we spend 9.1 per cent. of our GDP on health. In England, we spend only 6.5 per cent. We are already ahead of the European average.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Anyway we look at it, £5.8 billion will be spent on health in 2007–08. In 1996, the total Welsh block was £6 billion. It puts things into perspective when we consider the true figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As well as the importance of putting more money into the health service, I think that we would all agree that people expect improvements in delivery. That is why it is so important to match the resources and the investment with reform. The National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Bill was debated in the House of Commons and is currently in the other place. Hon. Members, some of whom have served on Committees, will be aware that it contains important clauses that relate to the reform of the health service. They also know that there are plans to introduce a draft National Health Service (Wales) Bill, which will complete those reforms in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not right to say that we are not reforming as well as investing. Of course more needs to be done. Members may like to know that I have discussed those matters with the First Minister, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has discussed them with the Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales. They are also committed to ensuring that proper delivery of the health service in Wales matches the reform that the House of Commons and the Assembly are implementing for the Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know that the alternatives, whether private or social insurance, proposed by some Opposition parties are not the answer to the problems that the health service faces. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said, what we decide for our health service, funded by taxation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not only determine the condition of our public services but define the character of our country."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 April 2002; Vol. 383, c. 589.]</p></blockquote>
We know that there are special health needs in Wales that need to be dealt with in a special way. We also know that we can do that collectively, and have done so. That is how we deal with things in Wales, whether in clubs, societies, trade unions, choirs, or even rugby teams. We work collectively towards achieving such aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week's Budget was a reaffirmation of the basic principles of our health service, which is so important because some Opposition parties could destroy them. It is a service for all, free at the point of use and paid for out of taxation. Those are the basic principles that Bevan decided should apply when the national health service was established in 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to my right hon. Friend that the poorest people in my communities would receive no benefit whatever from alternative methods of funding such as private and social insurance? Nye Bevan would be looking down on us and not smiling but beaming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. It would be a big beam, too, but he would not be beaming at the fact that, 50 years on, some politicians still want to denigrate, undervalue and undermine our
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
health service by putting something else in its place. Over the past few days, every public measurement of opinion in this country—polls and other methods—has demonstrated that people agree with what the Chancellor did last week. We do not want other methods of financing our health service. We value its principles, and people are willing to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Times</i> today, Peter Riddell writes under the headline, "Tories suffer as public approves health Budget". The reality is, frankly, that the Tories have it completely wrong. All the polls confirm it: apparently, even a majority of Conservative voters still want their national health service and support investing more money in it. That is the overwhelming view of the people of the United Kingdom and of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apologies for concluding with a quote from Aneurin Bevan's important book, "In Place of Fear":
	<br><blockquote><p>"The British Health Service has become a part of the texture of our national life. No political party would survive that tried to destroy it; no government that attempts to destroy it can hope to command the support of the British people. The great argument about priorities is joined, and from it a free Health Service is bound to emerge triumphant."</p></blockquote>
The Budget will ensure that our health service does become triumphant. Resources and investment are there. It is now up to us all in the Government and in the Assembly to match it with delivery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is customary on these occasions to start with some warm words. That is not really in my nature, but we could say that it is a good Budget for a bingo-playing, high-tech entrepreneur with no employees and several children who has just inherited £249,000 and enjoys a glass or two of real ale. The planned crackdown on tax avoidance by rich foreigners living in Britain will be bad news for Lakshmi Mittal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget is generally shot through with almost as many internal contradictions as the parliamentary Labour party. We are told that it is the end of Blairism, yet the Chancellor claims that nothing has changed, stressing continuity with previous policy. Neither of those views is correct. What has changed is that new Labour has stopped peddling lies. [HON. MEMBERS: "Order. Disgraceful."] I made no comment about a particular hon. Member. When Labour said in 1997 that the problems of the NHS were not a matter of resources, it was wrong. When it said at the last election that taxes would not have to go up to deliver improvements, it was wrong and knew it. In every previous pre-Budget report and manifesto policy statement, the Government insisted that the NHS was properly funded, which was not true, as was at last admitted in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second new Labour lie was that public services could be adequately resourced without further direct taxation. Unfortunately, rather than financing the investment through income tax, as we would have preferred, the Chancellor chose to increase national insurance. I remind the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) that the Conservative Government increased employers' national insurance contributions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
from 6.5 per cent. to 10 per cent. and the Labour Opposition at the time called it a tax on jobs. A plague on both their houses.

The measure will increase the tax burden on the public sector by about £60 million a year, including about £15 million or £20 million for the Welsh NHS. It is an unnecessary burden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The point has been made that in terms of national insurance contributions and the public sector, new Labour is effectively giving money with one hand and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
clawing some of it back with the other, which means that about a third of the extra investment may be bogus. As we heard, the extra health spending, is subject to the Barnett squeeze, which means that Wales's share of UK health spending will be cut year on year. The part of the UK that has the greatest health need will get the smallest health increase. That will mean a shortfall over the period we are discussing of about £100 million, which would be there if the year-on-year increase in England, and indeed throughout the UK, was matched in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that he is using statistics in the same misleading way as he has done before? He just said that Wales would receive the smallest increase of anywhere in the UK.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point is that we should not consider need in per capita terms. There has been a detailed discussion about that in Wales, as the hon. Gentleman will know. We need to recognise that the legacy of heavy industry is a problem. We have chronic health problems in Wales, which should be reflected in a higher per capita allocation, including in terms of the rate of increase.

There may be a new honesty about this Budget, although that honesty has its limits, as Lord Rooker discovered recently in another place. In broader terms, I do not think that it is a break with Blairism. In economic policy the Government are still wedded to the principles of neo-liberalism and monetarism. There was nothing, really, for manufacturing, which has suffered from the Government's policy of a high pound, as well as from the global economic slowdown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research and development tax credit for large companies had already been announced. The Engineering Employers Federation was right to criticise the Government for introducing a volume-based tax credit rather than an incremental one, which would have been far more appropriate for smaller companies and in terms of supporting new research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some £50 million of the £400 million credit for research and development will be swallowed up by just two companies in the pharmaceutical sector, from which the Labour party has received several donations in the past. How will grants of £50 million to GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca benefit the disadvantaged manufacturing regions? There were no measures of the sort that the manufacturing sector has been asking for in areas such as capital investment, coping with the climate change levy and improvement to the transport infrastructure. There was nothing on sterling and only businesses that are in profit, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
sadly not true of many in the manufacturing sector, will really benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national insurance changes will hit small businesses disproportionately, because a high proportion of their costs are staff-related. Many of them operate on very low margins indeed. The Secretary of State mentioned Consignia, which, it is true, is losing £1.5 million a day under this Government. It will now lose another £35 million to £40 million because of the changes. Corus has said that it will lose about £5 million as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax breaks for Wales's independent television production sector will end, adding about 10 per cent. to production costs, although the Secretary of State will be glad that films for theatrical release are to be exempted. I do not know whether he had a quiet word in the Chancellor's ear on that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was nothing for tourism. Ireland has produced amazing growth in the tourism sector by looking creatively at VAT rating for the hospitality sector. Unfortunately, there was no discussion of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wayne David 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does Plaid Cymru believe that joining the single currency would help manufacturing in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I was talking about tourism. However, we certainly need a competitive rate for sterling, which will be one of the preconditions for entry to the single currency. It was said recently that the Chancellor believes that a 30 per cent. devaluation would be necessary. He has the tools to bring about a managed devaluation, which would have an amazing effect on our export potential, not just in manufacturing but in other key exporting areas. I would gladly join forces with the hon. Gentleman in order to get the Chancellor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether to join the single currency before devaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was nothing for manufacturing. More than 40,000 jobs were lost in manufacturing in the four years from 1997 to 2000, according to the Government's own figures. That is 10,000 a year. Almost another 10,000 jobs were lost last year, according to the TUC. That makes 50,000 jobs lost in five years in manufacturing in Wales, which is an appalling record with which even the Tories could not have competed during their time at the helm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Lucas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I have been very generous, and I should like to make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the manufacturing summit, the TUC asked for £1 billion of aid for the manufacturing sector and received only £20 million for a couple of pilot projects. That says a lot about the lack of commitment and urgency that the Government have shown towards the crisis affecting the manufacturing sector. We give less state aid to our manufacturing sector than any country in the European Union other than Portugal. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Germany, aid is 32 per cent. higher than in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a speech that she gave a couple of months ago, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that she wanted to drive those levels of state aid down even further in the UK. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Demands on governments to bail out lossmaking companies become louder. The possibilities of using legislative power to prevent companies from laying off workers could acquire a new attraction."—</p></blockquote>
Heaven forbid—
	<br><blockquote><p>"But these pressures must be resisted."</p></blockquote>
That shows the Government's true attitude.

I referred to the European Coal and Steel Community treaty. Again, we have a valuable opportunity to think creatively about the new treaty and consider how we could use it to create a mechanism for regional investment aid for the steel industry in areas such as South Yorkshire and south Wales. We need to take our steel industry up the value chain so that we do not face cheap competition from other areas or Europe or Asia. Unfortunately, that is not the kind of thinking that the Government have gone in for recently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reality of the economic position that faces us, which is unfortunately part of a long-term trend under successive Labour and Conservative Governments, is that there is a huge shift of prosperity from the old manufacturing regions to the south-east of England.

Nothing in the Budget referred to operating aids. We are two and a half years into the objective 1 programme, and this was an historic opportunity for us to create a competitive advantage for our companies and to attract companies into Wales. We could have had the kind of fiscal packages that the Irish have used so successfully—but there was not a jot in response to the demands that the Labour and

The north-south divide continues to widen and deepen. In a speech this month, the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions referred to the "lottery of location" that determines life chances in this country, but in the same breath he denied the existence of the north-south divide. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The challenge for the government is to eradicate these differences. Not by holding back the successful but by putting in place the measures necessary to lift all to the level of the best."</p></blockquote>
The Government do not believe in regional policy and redistribution between the geographic regions of the UK. They are not prepared to use the tools that have been successful in the past in shifting the balance of economic prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the north-south divide continues to widen. In fact, the European Union's figures in the cohesion report show that the United Kingdom now has the highest level of disparity. The hon. Gentleman should be aware of that. The UK now has the highest inter-regional disparity in the EU, including Germany, which had to deal with the eastern Länder, and Italy, with the Mezzogiorno. The UK has a wider gap between rich and poor regions than other member states. It is scandalous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see also social inequality and widening health inequalities. I was struck by recent research conducted by Professor Townsend at Bristol university, which shows that premature mortality is much worse in Labour-voting constituencies under the present Government, whereas it had begun to improve under the Conservatives. That is scandalous, and I am sure that some outside Parliament will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to speak about public services. It was not an old Labour Budget. The Budgets of 1974–76 provided for a 5 per cent. increase public expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product. In this Budget, we are talking about a 1 per cent. increase. It is welcome, but it is not on the same scale as under previous Labour Administrations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has fallen into the same trap as his hon. Friends. The previous public spending included the enormous amount that was paid out in unemployment benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is only partially true. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] They are not my figures: they are the figures of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which was commissioned by the parliamentary Labour party for a pre-Budget briefing, so they must be right. However, we support the increase of 1 per cent., albeit it is belated and insufficient, because it is necessary. It is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
shame that it has taken six Budgets to arrive at this point, when we have been making a consistent case for the past five years that extra resources were needed for public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, some of that extra money will be consumed by private finance initiatives. Tucked away in the Budget papers are figures showing a doubling of the impact of PFI schemes on public spending since last year. It is now expected to reach £25 billion by 2004–05, whereas last year's figure was £13 billion. In a sense, the Government are privatising the national debt. PFI schemes are expected to cost £35 billion by 2005–06. The cost to the Revenue is worrying in both the short and the long term. Research in the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> shows that PFI hospitals have 35 per cent. fewer beds than those financed by traditional means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this one, I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the problem of public-private partnerships is not so much whether they can deliver services as the fact that it tends to cost the taxpayer more than keeping the services in the public sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree. It is a matter of efficiency. We are told that the mantra of new Labour is "Do what works"—but PFI does not work. It costs more in both the long and the short term. The Scottish Executive may be moving rapidly away from that, and we would like similar policy decisions to emanate from Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that PFI does not work.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no choice available to local authorities. Unfortunately, PFI is the only game in town: as the Secretary of State has said, it is PFI or bust.

There seems to be something of a hole in some of the Chancellor's figures. He sets out the annual increase in health spending for the next five years but we are told only how he would raise the tax for three years. He has used that trick before. The fear is that unless the Government are prepared to come clean and admit that there might have to be further tax increases if there are to be improvements in the other areas of public service—the Institute of Fiscal Studies has suggested an annual increase of between £4 billion and £6 billion, possibly by the end of this Parliament, and certainly afterwards—the only assumption that we can make is that they will freeze the level of spending on those vital services. Education, the police and transport infrastructure, which have also been underfunded, will then be in the position that the health service is in now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
There is an alternative, and that is to have an honest debate about taxation and public expenditure, and to reintroduce the progressive principle, as we and other parties have advocated. We have one of the lowest top rates of personal tax in the European Union. It is 62 per cent. in France, 55 per cent. in Germany and 51 per cent. in Italy. Even in the UK, we had a top rate of 60 per cent. until 1998, yet we are in a position in which incapacity benefit, for instance, is taxed at 50 per cent. for personal pension income above £85 a week. Can the Secretary of State tell me why disabled pensioners pay higher tax rates than millionaires? It makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that there are more determinants of health than spending. As well as poverty, there is housing, which the hon. Member for Cardiff, West mentioned. That is clearly an important factor in the health of our people over the long term. Simply investing more money in the health service, welcome, important and necessary as it is, will not address the long-term problems affecting the health of our people, so we need to look at a wider social policy agenda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman seen the most recent statistics on the health service in Wales? This is the record: local inpatient and day care activity up by 0.9 per cent., elective activity, including day cases, up by 1 per cent., emergency activity up by 0.9 per cent., total outpatient attendances up by 4.2 per cent. and new outpatient attendances up by 2.5 per cent. Even without the Budget statement, we are doing much better than we were five years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I welcome any improvement in the delivery of the health service. My point is that many of us would recognise that there is a far wider agenda, which has to do with levels of poverty and inequality in society. The Government have to grasp the nettle: welfare payments need to increase far more than they have done so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is, and I hope that I will be proven wrong—[	<i>Interruption</i>]. May I make this point? My fear is that in order to deliver higher levels of spending on health and possibly in other areas, the Government will have to keep social security payments, particularly benefit payments, down. Leaks from the Treasury to the 	<i>Financial Times</i> have suggested that one of the facts on which the figures are based is that in future it will have to pay out less, proportionately, on the basic state pension. That is a false economy in terms of the health of our people. We cannot provide the best health service in the world while undermining the social welfare that underlies the health of our people. Benefit rates must increase by 20 to 40 per cent. above the rate of increase in average wages if we are to undo the problems that appeared in the Thatcher years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the agenda should go wider than sickness and that we should consider health in the wider sense. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept, however, that there has been a record huge increase since 1997 in provisions such as child benefit? That is a universal benefit, and it is universally taken up. We all agree that families with children are often
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and I am aware of the hon. Lady's excellent work on behalf of children, for which she is well known. I shall not detain the Committee by getting into a detailed discussion of tax credits, but there are problems with the system's increasing complexity. Partisan politics aside, I am sure that she agrees that there are issues about take-up that need to be resolved. I am a great supporter of universalism, child benefit and restoring the link between the basic state pension and average earnings. She probably has some sympathy with that last point, which must be one of our key demands over the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on a central problem with the benefit system. As the hon. Lady said, there have been welcome increases in universal benefits, but at the same time the Government have increased their emphasis on means-tested benefits, and the minimum income guarantee is a key example. The Secretary of State said that 100,000 pensioners in Wales would gain under the minimum income guarantee, but he did not say how many people were ineligible. He does not have the figure, which is a disgrace, but the estimate is at least 45,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, and there are also issues with the stakeholder pension. The only long-term future lies with a return to the basic state pension as a universal benefit linked to average earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great shame that the Chancellor has frozen the winter fuel allowance for the next four years, which represents a real-terms cut. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If I may conclude, a key problem under this Government is the growing social and geographic inequality between the richest and the poorest, and between the United Kingdom's richer and poorer regions and nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Budget offered no succour to those of us who want to build a better future for our country—an ambition that is surely shared across this Room. We may disagree about some of the means, but there must be a bit more reality to the discussion. Inequality continues to grow under this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Most damningly, there is, as the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions put it so well, a lottery of location under this Government.

	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
One of the Committee's sittings last year took place following the Chancellor's Budget and the publication of the first Wanless report. I discussed the great expectation set out in that report, the difficulties involved in raising sufficient resources, and the issue of how to deal with the problems of choice and possible charging in the health service. Now that we have seen the second Wanless report, we can conclude that some of those big decisions have been made correctly. As a country and as a Government, we have decided to make a large-scale investment in the health service, and to fund it directly through taxation in the only cost-effective way, which is also less disruptive than the mechanisms that have been used in other western European countries. However, it is important to admit that there are difficulties with the system that we have chosen. The advantages outweigh the difficulties, but we do need to address the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the systems in other western European countries are diverse and funded by various mechanisms, it is much easier to introduce or maintain competition and choice in those systems than in our health service. That should not be the crucial argument, but it should make us consider what mechanisms we can employ that will provide sufficient responsiveness in our health system. I am sure that that is why the Wanless report argues for a rigorous and regular audit to ensure value for money. People are being asked to give a vast amount to the health service through taxation—the opinion polls show that they are glad to give—but they want to see that the money is being used wisely and delivering the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the relative lack of responsiveness in the health service as it is currently managed. It is anecdotal, but something that I am sure many people in England and Wales will have experienced. About five months ago, I received a phone call in the early hours of the morning from a very close relative who was in an accident and emergency unit in the Royal Gwent hospital, and I went to be with my relative. He had been waiting quite a long time to see a doctor, but that is not the issue that I wanted to raise—that is a question of resources, which we are dealing with by investing extra money. He was distressed, not only because he had been waiting, but because of the conditions at the hospital and the lack of cleanliness in the waiting facilities, especially the toilets. When he was eventually seen by a doctor, the medical care that he received was superb, but by the time we left, I was distressed. When I visited the toilets next to the lifts in the hospital, I noticed that they had obviously not been cleaned for many months, if not years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That evening, I went to a party meeting, held in Gladstone school. I was staring down at the floor thinking about what I was going to say, when I noticed that the floor was spotless. Later, I spoke to the caretaker—a very good caretaker—who showed me that the toilets were also spotless. There is no difference in the resourcing of the two places. Direct taxation funds both the school and the hospital, and we are not spending more money on cleaning the school than on cleaning the hospital, but there is a distinct difference in the responsiveness of the two
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
institutions. What would happen if the school facilities were as dirty as the hospital? First, the governors of the school, especially the parent governors, would be incensed that their children were working in such conditions and would do something about it. That responsiveness is not in the hospital. One does not have that direct accountability to people who have a long-term interest in the hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for some reason, the parent governors did not do something about the cleanliness of that school, there is another mechanism of responsiveness. Gladstone school is near to several other schools, and parents would make a choice and not go to it. They would choose to go to other schools, which would be a limited choice, but far less limited than the one available to my elderly relative, who had no choice about which hospital he was going to go to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that I, too, have a relative in that hospital, and another relative in another hospital in south Wales. Does he accept that the argument that he is making gives strength to some of the proposals from the National Assembly to bring control over the health service closer to both patients and units of the health service? That is an argument for closer local control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It can be argued that way, but my experience of a wide range of locally controlled, committee-run organisations does not fill me with confidence that one always gets that level of responsiveness because one has a local committee. Committees should want to improve the responsiveness of the organisation that they run, but often they feel that they have ownership of it. Sometimes they see the easiest thing to do as pretending that the problem is not as great as it is. Much more often, they say that there is a problem, but it is because they are not getting funded properly. They claim that, for some special reason, they should have more money than the place down the road, and they claim that that is why they are not performing quite as well. That happens often but not always.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that there may be an issue about the cleaning staff not feeling part of a team? That has happened in hospitals in some cases in which cleaning staff have been privatised and are not seen as part of the main team. Does he accept that the proposals coming from the National Assembly that hospital teams should be seen to include cleaners and porters may address that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what my hon. Friend says. I am sure that it is desirable that everyone who works in an organisation feels part of a team. Having said that, there is no excuse for a toilet in a hospital being filthy and not being cleaned. It is the responsibility of the people who run that organisation to make sure that that does not happen. All I am saying is that it is our responsibility as politicians to try to ensure that mechanisms, which are as responsive as they can be, are there so that those problems either do not arise or arise as little as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Wanless accepts that difficulty. That is why there has to be an emphasis on ensuring that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
there is an independent audit of how efficient organisations in the health service are, how they are delivering and what standard they are delivering. It needs to be independent from both politicians and managers of those organisations. Yes, we need resources, which are the first thing. I am delighted to endorse what my Government have done in putting in resources that I am sure that no other Government of any other party would have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Chancellor and Wanless say that we have to have reform and rigorous audit, and I endorse that. We must ensure delivery and we must not hide behind excuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to take part in the debate on the Budget and its impact on Wales. I have listened carefully to all the contributions so far. I think that I listened to a different Budget from the one to which Government Members were listening. I am now a bit of an expert on bingo and micro-breweries around Wales, and all the other things that the Chancellor spelt out in detail in the Budget. He waited until the very end to freeze the tax thresholds. National insurance rose by 1 per cent. on employers and the self-employed. The sting was in the tail—right at the very end—when he explained how all the extra money was going to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know about the money that will be made available to the national health service during the next five years. I look forward to the reannouncement of those figures time and again during the coming months and years when Ministers speak in Committees such as this. The big question mark was how the increase in funding would be paid for. A few months ago, in the general election campaign, the Government said that there would be no increase in income tax. They were a bit more coy when national insurance was mentioned. Now, we know why. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) says from a sedentary position that they are different. For the vast majority of people there is no difference. I admit that there are differences at the edges, but for the majority the tax on their incomes will go up by 1 per cent. The thresholds for tax will be frozen, and people will pay substantially more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has already mentioned the Peter Riddell article in 	<i>The Times</i> this morning. Did the hon. Gentleman notice that in its poll, 54 per cent. of Conservative voters specifically supported the use of the national insurance system to fund the NHS?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady will find that the vast majority of people in this country would want to see that taxation, whether through income tax or national insurance, effectively spent. That is what it is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hang on a moment. Hon. Members may remember Viv Nicholson, who won the pools in
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
the 1960s. She was the first big pools winner. When she was asked what she was going to do, she said, "I'm going to spend, spend, spend." Within a short space of time, she was broke and had nothing to show for it. It is not just a case of the money that we have to spend, it is how that money is effectively spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What people want at the end of the day is an effective national health service. I do not think that there is anyone in this Room who does not want to see an improved national health service. However, after five long years of a Labour Administration, during which the people of Wales were told that things can only get better, we find that too many facets of the national health service have got decidedly worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree with a survey in 	<i>The Times</i>—that bastion of the Labour party—at the weekend, which showed that 74 per cent. of readers agreed that the national insurance rise would benefit public services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but that does not get us away from the fact that the Government talk about inputs, and we are interested in output: value for money. We want every pound that is raised in taxation to be effectively spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members were honest with themselves, they would acknowledge that the sometimes record amounts of money that are invested in the national health service could be spent more effectively. I know that the former Minister, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), knows that because he has made comparisons of the costs of certain operations. If only best practice were introduced, a substantial sum of money could be made available without any increases in taxation. That could be invested in frontline services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. In Wales, spending on health is currently £1,166 per head higher than in England. Does that mean that Wales has a better health service than England?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through some of the statistics, although statistics, sadly, hide the individual misery felt by each person on a waiting list. The number of people in Wales on in-patient waiting lists for more than 12 months rose from 6,274 in March 1997 to 10,222 in February 2001. The number of those waiting for more than 18 months rose from 1,402 in March 1997 to 4,220 in February 2001. That is a rise of 47 per cent. in the number of people waiting more than 12 months and of 185 per cent. in the number waiting more than 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November 1998, 100,000 residents were waiting for a first out-patient appointment. In September 2001 that figure was 203,000. Welsh hospitals have a 10 per cent. vacancy rate for consultants and waiting lists of more than 200,000 for a hospital appointment, as I have said. There is just one consultant neurologist per 300,000 people in Wales compared with the recommended one per 100,000.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
More than £500 million has been wasted by the national health service in Wales during the past five years because of the massive variations to which I referred earlier. Caesarean sections at Glan-Y-Mor hospital cost £547 in 1997–98 whereas at Wrexham Maelor hospital they cost £1,945. There is a huge discrepancy there and we must find out why. Hip and femur replacements cost £2,589 at Pembroke hospital but £8,000 in Llandough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September 2001, 203,000 people in Wales were waiting to see a consultant for the first time, whereas in March 1997, the figure was 100,000. We have talked about independent audits, but a report by the Auditor General said that one third of NHS Wales buildings failed to meet health and safety and fire standards and that 1 per cent. were dangerously below those standards. One fifth of the estate in Wales is underused and £350 million needs to be spent to bring the buildings up to scratch. In Wales, there is one rheumatologist per 185,000 people whereas in Scandinavia there is one per 35,000, and there is not a single one in the whole of Dyfed and Powys. Yet one in four Welsh people suffer from arthritis. We are scouring the Philippines for nurses, when there is a problem of retention and those nurses are needed in the Philippines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list that I have read out should make us all ashamed. I do not think that Nye Bevan would beam to hear such statistics. They mean that things have got decidedly worse under the Labour Government. I want to ensure that the dedicated staff—the nurses and doctors—can deliver. They have a commitment to the NHS but, sadly, the bureaucracy and waste in the NHS has got decidedly worse, especially during the past five years. The reforms that Jane Hutt wants to introduce for the NHS will make that even worse. The bureaucracy, the extra bureaucrats and pen-pushers needed to deliver the reforms that she wants, will be great news for Rymans, for paperclips and pens, but very bad news for frontline health services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Chris Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave a lengthy list of statistics for people waiting to see consultants. Is he aware that it takes 17 years to train a consultant? The consultants available to treat people today will have started their training in 1985, at the height of the Thatcher regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that record investments were made in the national health service when the Conservatives were in power. Everyone accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem is that the expectations of everyone in Wales were cruelly raised during the period before the referendum on the Welsh Assembly. We were told then that things would be absolutely marvellous when the National Assembly came into being, but matters have got decidedly worse. Brian Gibbons, the Deputy Health Secretary in the National Assembly, has admitted that the health service is in a worse state than when the Conservatives left office. Such things as a cash injection of £28 million to tackle coronary heart disease should have meant dramatic improvement, but we know that only £8 million of that reached frontline services and £20 million went elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the need for more doctors and nurses. On 30 March, John Osborne, an ear nose and throat specialist at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, spoke about the shortage of consultants in hospitals throughout Wales. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's a very worrying situation. It's a more stressful job today, and people are retiring early. In the short term there's a problem. I think people will have to travel further for services".</p></blockquote>
All hon. Members' constituents in Wales will face that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I actually agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman says about delivery—as would Labour Members if they examined their hearts. The Budget sets out expenditure in excess of the EU average level. However, on delivery, does he sympathise with my constituents in Ceredigion, where an NHS dentist unfortunately died a couple of weeks ago? Anyone now seeking an NHS dentist in north Ceredigion is advised to go to Milford Haven, some 70 or 80 miles away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. He knows his constituency. I am sure that his mailbag is full of letters, each of which supplies another anecdote but means misery for the people involved—those on waiting lists, for example. The Morriston hospital in Swansea has the longest waiting list in the developed world for burns and plastic surgery—people are having to wait for nine years. In the United Kingdom in the 21st century, it cannot be acceptable for someone needing such a service to be expected to wait nine years. The problem must be dealt with. I say to the shadow Secretary of State for Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the real one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was getting a little ahead of myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Secretary of State for Wales, with all the extra money going into the NHS, we must ensure that it will pay dividends. More money is going into Wales, but it is not paying the dividends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's analysis of what is wrong in the NHS. Will he furnish me with his view of why, under the Conservative Government, there was approximately half the number of acute hospital beds in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the usage of those beds, not the length of time people stay in them, is important. People are staying in the beds far too long, blocking them and creating an acute problem—we all accept that. We must ensure that, when operations are finished, people are moved into other care beds or back home to receive care. Patients staying in hospital, blocking the beds and preventing others from getting in has become a genuine problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The First Secretary, Rhodri Morgan, says that he wants a world-class health service. Among others, he is currently scouring the world for people to work in our NHS. We are going to Spain and the Philippines for our nurses and Germany for our consultants while we are sending our patients to France. Indeed, it looks as though we are scouring the whole world to help the NHS in Britain to work. At the same time, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Government say that we can learn nothing from other countries about how the NHS should be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have a lot to learn and we should be open-minded. That is why my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Health has been talking to consultants, doctors and people involved in other health services to find out how they work. We will shortly introduce proposals to show how we can ensure that the money going into the NHS is better spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it for me to give electoral advice to the hon. Gentleman's party, but is he aware that he is in danger of falling into Sven-Goran Eriksson syndrome—flirting with Italian and Swedish models instead of concentrating on the domestic front, which will bring only trouble to him and to his team</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was hugely amusing. However, someone sitting at home watching that on television in Swansea, who has been waiting for nine years to go into Morriston hospital for an operation, or someone like the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central, who went to one of his local hospitals and saw the condition of some of the toilets, would say that there are genuine problems. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I do not think that we will continue with the Swedish model. I know that the story is gripping the tabloids at the moment, but goodness me, are not there more important things for our papers to write about, such as the state of our health service, street crime, and the lack of investment in manufacturing industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that other hon. Members want to speak, so I shall make my contribution relatively short, and shall move straight from the national health service to the economy. I make no excuses for that because only from a growing and prosperous economy can we get the money that we need to invest in our public services to improve them. I found it interesting that right at the end of the Chancellor's speech, he announced that the 1 one per cent. increase in tax would fall on jobs and those in jobs. The average wage of the self-employed in Wales is dramatically lower that that of the employed, so that one per cent. falls disproportionately upon the self-employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales entertained us with his rather, let us say, clipped version of today's business section of the 	<i>Western Mail.</i> He talked about the increase in optimism revealed by the Confederation of British Industry's survey. If he had bothered to cast his eyes further towards the bottom of that article, he would have read that the director of the CBI in Wales, Mr. Rosser, said that it was important to point out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the survey period was completed prior to the Budget, which added to employment costs for business of all sectors and sizes … We cannot be sure that recorded optimism would have bounced back in this way, had manufacturers known what was in store."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. We have already heard from members of Plaid Cymru that manufacturing unemployment has increased by 40,000 in four years. That unemployment is certainly not getting better, and I do not believe that putting 1 per cent. on national insurance will help. The CBI in Wales said that it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"extremely disappointing to see a rise of 1 per cent. in National Insurance Contributions in this Budget. Adding to the business cost base in this way at a time when profitability and competitiveness are under pressure—and effectively penalising employment—is unjustifiable."</p></blockquote>
The Institute of Directors expressed concern about the increase in taxation on business. It is especially concerned about the increase in employer national insurance contributions, which is a tax on jobs. It says that the huge increases in national health spending are
	<br><blockquote><p>"a gamble that resources will achieve results and a gamble that the economy will be strong enough to generate resources.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The rising tax burden can only damage economic competitiveness. Just as the rest of Europe is trying to reduce the tax burden, the UK is attempting to push it up."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State mentioned how important small businesses are to Wales. As I am sure every hon. Member here knows, I am the owner of a convenience store in Swansea and I employ eight people. The vast majority of businesses are small. The Federation of Small Businesses says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a tragedy that the Chancellor has decided that the self-employed will also pay higher National Insurance Contributions. The average income from self employment is just £13,890 compared to an average income from employment of £21,842 per annum. This undermines any attempts that the Chancellor has made to help the low paid."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very good at selective quotations. Does he note that Institute of Directors also said that it welcomes the measures to help small businesses, such as reductions in corporation tax and measures to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the VAT regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the beginning, in parts of his speech, the Chancellor waxed lyrical about what he was doing, which was tweaking at the edges of certain measures. He did so for 57 minutes. As we have heard, the vast majority of businesses in Wales are small and unincorporated and do not pay corporation tax, so the provision on corporation tax was of no help to them. Overall, the advantages to businesses that came from the tweaking of the measures were completely undone by that 1 per cent. increase in the national insurance contribution. We should be worried about that. The minimum wage was mentioned earlier. Many people who pay national insurance and tax on that may find that the 10p given with one hand in October is clawed back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State says "not at all", but giving it with one hand and clawing it back a few months later is hardly generous.

During questions, I mentioned council tax. There is an onus on the Government, and I look forward to the Secretary of State's letter clarifying his point about taxation being lower here than in our European Union neighbour countries. Whether that included stealth taxes—council tax is one of the more regressive stealth taxes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a tax. In Wales, four years ago, when the Government came to power, the average council tax was £495. Today, it is £710. The worst area in Wales is Neath Port Talbot, where, when the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
Labour party came to power, it was £619. Today it is £884. That is an increase of £265. Do the people of Neath Port Talbot believe that they are getting better services for their money? I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks a great deal about stealth taxes. There is nothing stealthy about council tax. As he well knows, the council tax is one of the most open taxes in terms of people understanding how it is spent. He talks a great deal about taxation, but Conservative Members have already said that they want the amount that the Chancellor has given the United Kingdom and Wales to spend on the health service over the next several years to be retained. They agree with that spending and that we should spend billions of pounds more. Does he agree with that? If so, how would he pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State for Wales knows that our shadow Secretary of State has gone around the world looking at how health services operate in other countries. As I said earlier, we want a world-class health service here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do we?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, 250,000 people paid out of their own pockets for operations that they could not have on the national health service. Is that not damning? It is a damning statistic that last year, 250,000 people dipped into their life savings in some areas, simply because they could not have the service that they needed on the national health service. Things are not right. It is a question not merely of putting in that money but of ensuring that it is more effectively spent, which is what we want. Extra money without the proper reforms will be useless. The reforms that the Welsh Assembly suggests will do damage rather than improve the circumstances in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly discuss two other aspects of the Budget. As has already been mentioned, there was little in the Budget to help the rural economy. Indeed, there was nothing for tourism and agriculture. We were all upset to hear the news of the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in Wales and hope that it can be contained and eradicated. Agriculture in Britain, including Wales, has experienced the most torrid time over the past few years. Foot and mouth was a body blow not merely to agriculture but to tourism. The regional director of the south and west Wales Country Landowners Association, Jonathan Andrews, said of the Budget:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chancellor has effectively excluded the rural economy from his 'community of entrepreneurship' because his reforms affect only corporate business".</p></blockquote>
That situation needs to be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know how important agriculture is to Wales from the point of view of not merely food but tourism and the environment. Anyone who has taken only scant notice of anything that I have said over the past 10 years will know that I am not the biggest enthusiast for the European Union in the House of Commons. However, it is shocking and scandalous that we must rely on the EU to have an independent inquiry into the outbreak of foot and mouth. Something should have been done about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Earlier, we discussed money, resources and output. How that money is spent is important. In Wales, as we all know, the Welsh Assembly plays an important part in determining that. And, my goodness, would it not send the right signal—indeed, this might be the first popular thing that it has done, other than establishing the Children's Commissioner for Wales, for which I give it credit—if it were to scrap its proposals for the Welsh Assembly building and plough all the money into more consultants, or doctors and nurses? Surely hardly any members of the Committee think that building a new palace for politicians, as opposed to spending it for the benefit of the people, is an effective use of the money. The Welsh Assembly should reconsider that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time has passed, and I will bring my remarks to a close because others wish to make a contribution. Slowly, after five years of a Labour Government, some Labour Members are trying to break free. They now feel able to criticise their Government when they think that that Government are wrong. There will be no public services in Wales if Labour Members stand up one after another, pat the Government on the back and say how wonderful the Budget is, when they know that there are deep-rooted problems in Wales—in the NHS, manufacturing industry, regional transport and businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face real problems in trying to open Wales up to get more people to come in. I ask Labour Members not to look at this and previous Budgets through rose-tinted spectacles. They must tell the Government whenever they see that the Government have got it wrong—and on national insurance contributions, clearly, the Government have got it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem with Welsh politics, certainly in Westminster, is the competition between parties. Plaid Cymru wants taxes to go up even further and has its own agenda for an independent Wales—which is not joined-up thinking. The Liberal Democrats ask for a 1 per cent. increase on income tax to pay for the NHS. When they get it, they say they did not want it to go on employers. Then they vote for it—their policies are all over the place. The Government have shot their fox. Is there any need for Liberal Democrats in Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a new realism and common sense about taxation in Wales. The Government should think again. Let us encourage businesses to grow and thrive and not saddle them with extra taxation. Let them create profits, and out of those profits we will create a world-class health service and world-class public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hywel Francis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome this Budget, with its commitment to fairness and enterprise, for three reasons, all of which relate to a commitment to social solidarity. First, the rebuilding of the NHS is essential to the people of Wales. Secondly, the specific commitment to fairness is welcomed by those of us in Wales who are committed to building a fairer and more socially just society. Thirdly, it is a reaffirmation of the modern, social democratic values that are so important—to Wales, Britain and Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
The massive investment in the NHS strengthens the principle of health care being universally available and free at the point of delivery. The Budget's commitment to the NHS is deeply rooted in the social history of Wales—the liberalism of Lloyd George and national insurance, and the community socialism of Aneurin Bevin's Tredegar Medical Aid Society. For at least a moment, this Budget draws a line under the unwarranted attacks on the NHS since its inception in 1948. The people of Wales welcome it for that reason, not least because of the disproportionate scale of ill health in our communities—for example, one in four adults in Wales suffer from arthritis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget emphasises using enterprise and sound fiscal policies to build a fairer society, tackle pensioner and child poverty, increase employment opportunity for all, deliver high-quality services and protect the environment. It reminds everyone, if they need reminding, that this is a radical and reforming Budget from a radical and reforming Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate that important commitment, let me give hon. Members one example. I refer to community rebuilding through support for voluntary organisations, and specifically community amateur sports clubs. I have recently spoken to people in several sporting organisations in my constituency, who remind me of the time when I wrote a history of Seven Sisters rugby club—my local club—appropriately called "Magnificent Seven". Sport plays a large part locally in the development of active citizenship, improving health and enhancing social cohesion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Glyncorrwg last weekend, I met the bowls, rugby and soccer clubs. At Skewen, I recently met the rugby club, the Monkstone sailing and cruising club and—most important of all, of course—Aberavon rugby football club, whose tie I proudly wear today. They all play a central role in community capacity building, and welcome the Budget commitment to their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, I look forward to the next spending review and Budget achieving fairness and greater opportunities for homeless young people. While housing is a devolved matter and the Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communication, Edwina Hart, is dealing with it with imagination and passion, we in Westminster have a responsibility to assist young people who have no homes of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the all-party group on children in Wales, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan), met two young people from the Bays project and their support agencies from Swansea, who identified two basic problems: an unfriendly benefit system and a need for the Government to take their parenting role more seriously. Those young people have produced a video called "Cold Light", made by Kickstart Films, which has the emotional impact of "Cathy Come Home". Young homeless people need to be assisted from a state of barely surviving to a state of living with some dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Chancellor in his next spending review to reconsider the low rate of entitlement up to 25, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
difficulty of claiming benefit at 16 and 17, the single-room rent restriction and the fact that benefit for young people in full-time education ceases at 19, when so many of those who have been homeless start their education much later than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend remembers one of the young people saying that a loaf of bread costs the same whether one is 16 or 26.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Francis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young homeless people are probably the most besieged section of our community. Let us make it a priority, in the spirit of fairness and enterprise, that in the next spending review as much importance is attached to their needs as to the abolition of child poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final reason for supporting the Budget is that it represents the antithesis of what happened in France at the weekend. The values of social democracy are deeply embedded in Wales, and in Britain and Europe as a whole. Those values are based on social solidarity, citizenship and internationalism. I despise the racist and neo-fascist slogans, "France for the French" and "Wales for the Welsh". The Chancellor's Budget reminds us of our duties to one another as citizens, and I warmly welcome it as a great Budget for the people of Wales and as a measure as significant as Aneurin Bevan founding the national health service in 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should say that coming to the Committee to debate the Budget today has given me a sick feeling in my stomach. That is because I got food poisoning last night. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire for providing a good meal. He is a very nice man, and the food tasted nice at the time. With the general progress of inquiries in the Assembly, I fully expect the police to open an inquiry to see whether Mike German did the cooking. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] While I may be sick in body, I hope that I am never short on spirit. I believe, as some other hon. Members do, in reintroducing vision and soul into politics. There is no more important point at which to do that than when discussing the Government's Budget priorities, because that is where the rubber really hits the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, we welcome the Budget. That is not surprising because, just as the welfare state was created by Beveridge and implemented by a Labour operative, so this Budget was conceived in the 1997 Liberal Democrat manifesto and implemented five years later by this Government. We are not looking for gratitude from hon. Members, but we are certainly willing to clear up any remaining confusion with regard to policies that involve honest tax and spend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of this debate is the question of what to do about the health service and whether the Government are right to effectively increase direct taxation. We can play with words and talk about direct income tax versus national insurance, but the ordinary person on the Cardiff omnibus will regard the measure as a tax increase. What is interesting is that they do not mind. There is conditional acceptance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
of the policy—the condition being that it should deliver results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats have been saying for many years that if politicians do not patronise the public—if we give them a clear choice and are honest about the cost—they will respect us for it. That is probably why our share of the vote in the general election went up, even though we were the only party to promise tax increases. I am encouraged that the Government have taken a leaf out the Liberal Democrat book, bearing in mind that there was no promise to increase direct taxation in the Conservative or Labour manifestos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Huw Irranca-Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the essence of politics, as with comedy, is timing? The public are ready for such increases because this Government have provided the most stable economic base that we have had for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the essence of politics is telling it like it is and trusting the public to take an informed decision. I have had interesting conversations with the hon. Gentleman about that. Of course, a degree of political management is necessary in order to win elections rather than lose them. However, the Government got it wrong. If they had had the courage of their convictions at an earlier stage, we would be five years into implementing the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point about political management. However, I am suggesting, and the Liberal Democrats have proved, that such management is unnecessary on the issue of tax, because the public, when respected, respond to that compliment sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with some elements of the Budget in roughly the order that they were resolved. The priorities of my speech go from one place to another, but some specific relevancies need to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, one measure that has not been mentioned yet, but which is very important, is the change in duty on
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
beverages made with spirits—effectively alcopops. That is important not just because it will raise £210 million by 2004–05, but because such drinks are generally consumed by young people. I am realistic enough to know that this increase probably will not reduce underage drinking, but it acknowledges that we should start thinking seriously about the social problems that we engender through our attitude to different spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small breweries abound in rural areas. In conversations at a top-level meeting with representatives of the Campaign for Real Ale last night, it was suggested that—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sure that the real ale that they recommended in the Strangers Bar, which was appropriately called Rebellion, was not responsible for my malaise. The Campaign for Real Ale said that places such as Wales, especially rural Wales, will benefit a great deal from the change, which will not cost the Government very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On vehicle excise duty there were welcome changes, with an environmental agenda. That is very important. We probably should be doing more, but we will have to take that a step at a time. I am pleased that, once again, motor cycles have received fairly favourable treatment. I declare an interest in that I am vice-chair of the all-party motor cycle group. We sometimes need to consider different ways to decongest our roads, especially in places such as Cardiff, which suffers from terrible congestion. Two wheels may be an important element in the strategy to achieve that. In 1997, the governing party said that it would put motor cycles at the heart of its traffic strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Despite recent labour market statistics, which reflect the fundamental strength of the Welsh economy, some parts of the economy, such as manufacturing, continue to face real and sustained difficulties. There are no simple solutions at hand to ease these problems, but the Government are helping British manufacturing to raise its game and to shift its focus from competing on the basis of cost alone towards high skill, high value-added products and processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
