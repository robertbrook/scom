	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, Mr. Griffiths, I should like to make a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday's pre-Budget report is good news for Wales. In particular, the measures that do more to help everyone of working age to get into work are most welcome. The Secretary of State of State for Work and Pensions is elaborating on the Chancellor's announcement, and I am delighted to be able to tell the Committee how Wales will benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we are extending Jobcentre Plus across the whole country, starting next year. Jobcentre Plus is the single gateway to the benefits system, where everyone of working age will have work-focused interviews that will help them into jobs. I recently visited the extremely successful pilot office in Bridgend, where I was most impressed by the results being achieved by the dedicated staff. It is excellent news for Wales that we can provide the same quality service to all our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are allocating an additional £6 million across Great Britain to the rapid response service over the next two years. That is a pot of money from which the Employment Service in Wales can draw to fund additional advisers in cases of significant redundancy. We mean significant in the context of the local labour market; we do not necessarily mean large-scale redundancy. When people lose their jobs, we will be able to respond more quickly. Prompt help will be given to retrain people and to get them back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know all too well how damaging both large and small-scale redundancies are to communities in Wales, although the overall economic picture is strong. Every month, people change jobs or get jobs, so we need to do more to match people with the vacancies that employers are trying to fill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we need to provide extra support for those who require more intensive help to get into work. I welcome the new measures that will increase employment opportunity for the long-term unemployed. The transitional employment pilots, which build on the success of the new deal, will take place in two areas—Wrexham and Cardiff—where there are significant pockets of long-term unemployed people despite relatively high levels of economic activity. People are out of work in those areas, despite jobs being unfilled. The Cardiff pilot will start in April 2002 and will be one of the first six in Great Britain. The Wrexham pilot will start early in 2003.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
In those areas, we will pilot transitional jobs for some of the hardest to help, investing £2.8 million in Wales to equip more than 400 people with skills, support and work experience who would not otherwise have those things. Each pilot will offer 20 places on a rolling basis. People who take up those jobs will be better able to make the transition from unemployment to unsupported jobs in the open labour market. They will receive training while they are at work and help to develop job search skills. That individual support will give people self-esteem, confidence, new skills and an up-to-date work record. They will gain experience of the discipline of going to work every day and be better placed to find permanent work. They will be more attractive to employers, as it is still the case that it is easier for people to get a new job when they are already in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will ask employers, local authorities and other organisations with experience of the intermediate labour market to work with the Employment Service in Wales to put the programme together. We will ensure that it links properly to the local labour market, and the Government will bear the cost. We want to provide transitional jobs in a wide variety of occupations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who take up the jobs will receive the minimum wage. They will be better off in work than on benefits. They will have the same employment rights as anyone else. They will be entitled to the same in-work benefits as anyone else. They will be able to stay in the transitional job for up to a year. They will be offered a choice between jobs, but they will not be able to turn down all offers and remain on benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is good news for Wales. It means that we in Wales can pioneer new ways of creating job opportunities for all and new ways of helping those people who have missed out in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the transitional employment schemes. I wish the pilot schemes a fair wind and hope that they work out so that they can be extended. I also welcome the rapid response service for redundancies. I am acutely aware of the problems at the Alcoa works in Dolgarrog in my constituency and the problems of Waunarlwydd in Swansea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the new Jobcentre Plus set-up, will the Minister take note of what the Public and Commercial Services union has said about the open-plan nature of the offices and the need for better security? In the past few weeks, several staff have been assaulted and better security is warranted, although I am sure that open-plan offices are, broadly speaking, a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments on the Government's measures to help and employ people in Wales, especially those in areas where long-term unemployment predominates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Jobcentre Plus, I mentioned in my statement that I visited Bridgend, which is an open-plan office, and was deeply impressed by what I saw there. The information technology resources available for people looking for jobs were impressive, but so was the way in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
which the stigma of searching for a job, which, when I was a young man certainly existed, has been removed. I understand the hon. Gentleman's points on security, but I can assure him that the closed-circuit television and other measures that are being implemented will cover his concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will recall that in Newport we have already had experience of rapid response in incredible and sad circumstances at Llanwern. Does he agree that the staff of the agencies involved in the job shop at Llanwern deserve our appreciation, thanks and congratulations for the remarkable work that they have done on behalf of the people affected by redundancy? Does he also agree that if Jobcentre Plus is developed in the same spirit of skill-sensitive, well co-ordinated and individually tailored help, no one need fear anything from the obligation to attend for work-focused interviews? The language may sound daunting but the reality of those interviews is very encouraging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend's points, particularly in regard to the problems that he in particular and I, in my own constituency, have had to face because of job losses in Llanwern. I agree that the atmosphere in the job centres is now much more welcoming and that the stigma has disappeared. All of us in Wales, whatever constituency we represent, can welcome that, because all of us have seen reductions in unemployment in the past four or five years. That is because so many people want to work, but were not given such opportunities in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Minister for sight of his statement. Measures that help adjust the corrosive and wasteful consequences of unemployment are most welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some specific questions. First, will the £6 million allocated to the rapid response service come from the Great Britain fund, or will there be a separate allocation for Wales? Secondly, what will be the practical consequences of creating a single gateway to the benefits system through Jobcentre Plus for people using the benefits system? What difference will they notice on the ground? Will there be less bureaucracy or streamlined access to the system, for example?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is there a minimum size for a local labour market if it is to be helped by the rapid response service? For example, would Llanidloes, which is having problems, be able to benefit from the scheme, or would it be too small?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point concerns the new deal, which I have always supported. Sometimes it has been criticised for not creating enough long-term employment once individuals come off the new deal. What confidence does the Minister have that many will not fall back into unemployment after the scheme has finished?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in his statement that people would be guaranteed to be better off under the new scheme than if they stayed on benefit. Like all hon. Members, I occasionally meet people who have calculated that
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
they will be better off by staying on benefit. Will the Minister assure me that, if that sometimes proved to be the case, he would seriously make representations to ensure that there would be no prospect of people being punished simply for taking employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman on his last point. The system that we have introduced, including the working families tax credit, gives people the opportunity to work and earn more than if they are not in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £6 million covers Great Britain. In terms of the rapid response service, where that money is spent will depend on where it is needed. The Jobcentre Plus pilots in Wales will be extended to as much of Wales as possible over time. They provide a new way of seeking jobs so that young men and women can fulfil their potential. It will help the not-so-young as well, as those over 50 will also benefit from the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employment transition service has two pilots in Wales. I hope that they will be extended to other parts of Wales when we see them work well. Wrexham and Cardiff were chosen because they had high-level pockets of specific types of unemployment, but lots of other jobs that could be drawn on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kevin Brennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State agree that probably the only way in which someone who had been given a job under the transitional employment scheme would be worse off would be if he worked illegally? Everyone who gets a job with a minimum wage under the scheme ought to be better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the scheme and ask the Minister to confirm the fact that city constituencies such as mine regularly have unemployment figures in the top five in Wales, contrary perhaps to popular belief. That is because of the problems of long-term unemployment in some estates, including some in my constituency, where people can be especially hard to help. The purchase of a job for those people by the Government under the scheme will be especially helpful in getting them back to work and giving them the chance of a job in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the initial points made by my hon. Friend. If he and other members of the Committee considered the wards that would benefit from the abolition of stamp duty, which I referred to this morning, they would see that many wards in areas of traditional high employment and high prosperity were clearly highly deprived. There are pockets in rural areas and cities that can be as deprived as parts of my constituency, which, as a valley constituency, is traditionally associated with high levels of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is common throughout Wales but, by tackling pockets of high unemployment, we are getting to the cause of the difficulties that places such as Cardiff and Wrexham have had, despite the fact that they have seen tremendous economic inward investment and prosperity over several years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Secretary of State get away with what he has said. The three measures that he has announced this afternoon are woefully inadequate. Jobcentre Plus is totally uncosted; we do not know how much extra money will be put into it. The rapid response service has £3 million a year for the whole United Kingdom, so Wales will be lucky to see £1 million and will probably get less. The transitional employment service will help 20 people in Cardiff next year, with Wrexham not coming on stream until the year after that, which will help an additional 20 people a year. The total cost will be £2.8 million over many years. Is it not about time that we had less spin and more substance so that we can help those in real need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reality is that thousands of people who would not have been working had they been left to the devices of the last Conservative Government are working because of the measures that this Government have introduced, particularly under the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Jobcentre Plus, I invite the hon. Gentleman to visit a jobcentre to see what is done for people. That will ensure that he realises that people go to such places to look for jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much additional money will there be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not simply a question of how much is spent. We could spend money on building jobcentres and that could be the end of the matter. What matters is what people do in them. If the hon. Gentleman visits the pilot schemes, he will see how they have transformed the way in which people look for work in Wales and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman speaks about the rapid response services as if the money is directly for people who are made redundant. That is not the case: it is for the advisers who help individuals who are made redundant. The £6 million for Great Britain marks an excellent advance towards achieving that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman obviously missed the point about the employment transition service: it is in the pilot stage. The purpose of the schemes is to see whether the service works. If it does, it will be extended to other parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Pre-Budget Statement</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day]</i>,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Matter of the Pre-Budget Statement and its implications for Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Paul Murphy</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, we occasionally debated minute details of the pre-Budget statement and I want now to consider its strategic aspects and its impact on my constituency. This morning's negativity was a little disappointing
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
and I am pleased to be here to welcome the measures in the pre-Budget statement and their effect on my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pembrokeshire has traditionally been one of the first areas to suffer in an economic downturn. Small businesses create and support the majority of jobs, about 95 per cent, of which are in firms that employ fewer than 10 people. In his speech, the Secretary of State referred to the sector's importance. Small and medium-sized enterprises provide a greater proportion of jobs in Pembrokeshire than in other parts of Wales. The remaining 5 per cent, of jobs are with large, multinational companies, which have occasionally come and gone as a result of external, often global pressures. Those jobs are, however, often the best paid and most highly skilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I welcome the Chancellor's outline of the state of the UK economy. Many of us were sometimes frustrated and bewildered during the first two years of the Labour Government, post-1997. Labour Back Benchers might not have made a noise publicly, but we continually grilled Ministers privately about their course of action. After 18 years of Tory under-investment and neglect, we wanted to make changes immediately. At times, the discipline of sticking to Tory spending limits for the two years following 1997 was difficult and it stuck in many of our throats. That was true not least of pensions, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn) referred. None the less, the Chancellor assured us that short-term prudence would pay long-term dividends. It is evident from this week's statement on the economy that it was right to hold faith with that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual measures in the pre-Budget statement will benefit the people of the UK in general and those of Wales in particular. However, the underlying economics in the statement offer us stability, particularly in these uncertain times following 11 September. They offer us a much better vessel in which to weather the international storm than we would have had had the Chancellor been less of an iron Chancellor and more of a flexible friend in the early days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An abiding recollection of political campaigning in the 1990s is of the constant references to John Major overseeing a doubling of the national debt when he was Prime Minister. Many constituents asked me why the issue was so important and why it was continually raised. The message began to register when I pointed out that it the same as an individual repaying interest on an overdraft and it hit home only when I pointed out that the UK paid more in debt interest each year than it spent annually on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past four years, press commentators and Opposition politicians have questioned why we should repay the national debt, instead of having a one-off spend. Similarly, there were loud calls for us to spend the money from the licensing of the mobile phone spectrum in a one-off splurge—like an excited teenager with their birthday money. Again, however, the benefits of the Government's longer-term thinking have become clear in retrospect. Their thinking has resulted in the £1 billion that was saved on debt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
repayments being available to spend on the NHS throughout the UK. I shall refer in a moment to the £49 million destined for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our national debt is now the lowest among the G7 countries and our major European competitors. That is a vital component in helping the UK to build the battlements to withstand the current global difficulties. Only time will tell how matters will develop, but we would not have been able to do that had we taken a short-term rather than a long-term view with an eye to fundamental stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stability is all-important for Preseli Pembrokeshire. Our local economy has always relied heavily on a handful of multinational companies that are subject to global pressures. Small businesses provide the bulk of our jobs. The UK economy's underlying strength in global terms will, I hope, protect our multinationals. At the same time, the stability of the economy, the reductions in corporation tax and capital gains tax that were mentioned in the statement, the reduction in bureaucracy for small businesses' VAT returns, the £50 million fund to help small and medium-sized enterprises and the raising of the threshold for stamp duty for businesses and domestic purchasers in deprived areas will do much to support the small businesses that are the mainstay of local rural economies such as that in Pembrokeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the current international difficulties and their global implications, full employment and a job for everyone who needs one must continue to be the Government's goal, and I am pleased that the report makes it clear that that is the case. The base of stability is there to assist the businesses that provide our jobs, but another element is necessary: we must continue the system of tax credits to reward work and make it pay. Many families in my constituency have benefited by up to £520 a year from the working families tax credit, which was introduced last year. The measures that were announced yesterday to extend the principle to people on low incomes who do not have children is a further step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figures from my constituency show a dramatic decrease in unemployment in the past four years. In January 1999, those unemployed for six months or more totalled 1,375, but the latest figure—for October 2001—has fallen to 659. Notwithstanding the impact of global recession, it is important that work continues to support that trend.

Pembrokeshire has a keen sense of its environmental value. I therefore welcome the Chancellor's commitment to introduce further tax incentives to encourage cleaner, energy-saving technologies in industry and transport. On cleaner energy production, the TotalFinaElf refinery in my constituency has led the way in the production of ultra-low sulphur diesel and petrol in the UK. It is a model of how forward thinking on environmental issues can generate economic advantages, not economic costs. The refinery is a much-valued local employer and a valuable contributor to the drive towards cleaner, less-polluting transport.

On another transport issue, haulage contractors that operate from my constituency will welcome the principle of making foreign companies pay to use UK roads. Our close proximity to Ireland means that haulage contractors in west Wales have felt at a distinct disadvantage in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that I have mentioned bodes well for jobs and businesses in Wales and further afield, despite the parlous international scene. Two other aspects of the statement are, however, vital to Wales and my constituency. There are more than 16,000 people of pensionable age in my constituency. Pensioners, who worked hard during their working lives, seek only security in their old age. The measures introduced last year—the minimum income guarantee, pension rises and winter fuel allowance—meant a great deal to my pensioners. I know that because many pensioners have approached me in the street to tell me so. The Government's continued commitment to their security outlined in yesterday's statement is only right and proper. I hope that the annual increase of at least £100 in the basic state pension, plus the guarantee of £200 winter fuel allowance for the life of this Parliament will mean that never again will pensioners have to choose between eating or heating, as has so often been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the short-term versus the long-term and the savings on national debt interest payments in relation to Wales. That long-term vision has freed £1 billion this year for the NHS UK-wide. Wales' share of that will be £49 million. It will obviously be for the Assembly to decide how to spend that money. That is the result of true partnership and, indeed, subsidiarity—the benefits gained by Welsh MPs at Westminster being passed to the Assembly to be used for the specific needs of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health delivery in Wales is the Assembly's responsibility. Our role in Westminster is to strive for a fair share of funding for Wales. The Assembly's role, in partnership with Westminster, is to spend that money on the delivery of services for Wales. That is the true nature of devolution, not the separatism by any of a variety of names that newspapers say is advocated by Plaid Cymru. Those Labour Members who supported the setting up of the Assembly in 1997 had a vision of a new style of co-operative government—the Assembly working with Westminster for the good of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of the pre-Budget statement, the Secretary of State's explanation of the evolutionary processes that surround primary legislation affecting Wales was useful. Indeed, the word "processes" played a prominent role in our discussions on devolution. As one who supported and continues to support the partnership offered by devolution, I believe that the definition of that word is best outlined by its industrial use, most notably in the oil industry, which is so important to Pembrokeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process in the oil industry is the transforming of bulk raw materials into a working form. The Assembly has the raw materials in the form of Treasury funding, but to an extent that never existed in the Tory years. It now has the opportunity and the challenge to turn that into a working form to fit the specific needs of Wales.

To suggest anything else would constitute misrepresentation. I support the view so well articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan) that it would mitigate against the spirit of devolution as agreed by the population of Wales in the referendum and by the House in supporting the Government of Wales Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The political correspondent of 	<i>The Guardian</i> said yesterday that entrepreneurs, pensioners and the NHS seemed to be the main winners in the pre-Budget statement. That is only partly correct. It is a further step towards creating a fair society, with opportunity for all. The people of Wales and the UK as a whole are the real winners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, welcome yesterday's pre-Budget statement, particularly the Government's commitment to deliver £1 billion to the health service in the United Kingdom and the consequential £49 million that I hope will be used for health services in Wales. I was also pleased about the publication of the Wanless report, which I have been reading assiduously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a firm adherent of new Labour's oft-stated philosophy. We believe in what works—in other words, that our policy should be based on evidence and not dogma. That evidence must be collated, researched, tested, independently assessed, and, whether critical or embarrassing, it should be openly presented and debated to allow us better to deliver improved policies and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wanless report is a good start to the vital process of improving the health service. I have not had time to read the report in detail, but the Prime Minister referred to it in Prime Minister's questions only an hour ago. He referred to three of the four mechanisms that it identifies for funding the health services of most countries similar to ours—general taxation, social insurance and private insurance. The fourth, which is out-of-pocket payments made by patients for the use of particular parts of the health service, is used quite a lot in some countries but not here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report compares our spending with that of other countries. In Britain, we spend about £1,100 per person on our health service, which is about 6.8 per cent, of GDP. In Wales, we spend considerably more than that per capita. The average of the countries compared in the report is a good deal more again; for instance, it is about 8 per cent, of GPD in France and Spain, which is roughly another £200 per person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
The Prime Minister said something else of interest in Prime Minister's questions—I do not know if he meant to—when he reiterated his aim to ensure that we meet the average levels of expenditure of other European countries by 2005, which is three years from now. My rough calculation tells me that that will mean finding an extra £600 per taxpayer within the next four years. That change will not be popular in all quarters. The interim report does not deal with whether the general public will accept paying that sort of increase in taxation. I do not know whether the full report will discuss that, but I am sure that that important consideration will be occupying the Chancellor's mind, if not the Prime Minister's, as I speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also deals with the health service changing to meet the requirements of modern society, which demands far more of the service than it did when it was created in 1945. We demand far more choice. A one-size-fits-all health service will not be seen as modern in the way that consumers of services usually expect. Should charges be made for some services? What services does the NHS provide that are not intrinsically clinical? For example, some people might want television sets next to their beds. Should they be provided through taxation for the NHS? A year ago, my two-year-old daughter was recovering from pneumonia. A television next to her bed would have been helpful. I could have even argued that it was a clinical necessity. However, if I were ill in hospital, the taxpayer should not pay for me to have a television. Some of my colleagues—not me, I am a technophobe—might want a computer next to the bed. They might want to conduct business in hospital. That is reasonable, but it should not be paid for out of taxation. How should we provide choice? Should there be charges in the system? To carry on as before will not meet people's expectations of the health service in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report provides evidence. Derek Wanless and the other people who prepared it will provide us with more evidence about how the health service should develop. 	<i>The Western Mail</i> published more evidence today. The report was titled "Damning report into hospital failing", which is how sub-editors like to write headlines. The article details a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into hospital building management:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a comprehensive analysis of the … NHS estate, Auditor General Sir John Bourn also found that a fifth of the estate is underused and 3 per cent, is simply empty. According to Sir John, better management of this space could reduce running costs across Wales by around £25m a year—enough to build an entirely new hospital."</p></blockquote>
It is vital that independent organisations audit and examine the use of public money so that we can learn from that evidence, no matter how embarrassing it is, and improve services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more positive note for Wales, about six or seven weeks ago, the CAG published a report that stated that accident and emergency waits in London were the worst in the United Kingdom—some waits lasted six or seven hours—but that, in Wales, they were the shortest. That report prompted an immediate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
response from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State* for Health and I am sure that services will improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During this morning's sitting, I drew the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales to an independent report on local authorities' service delivery. In case you are tempted to stop me, Mr. Griffiths, I remind you that the Welsh Assembly is entitled to use £49 million for any services. Perhaps it will decide to spend that on local government. The report refers to a worrying performance gap. Of the services that were considered in Wales, it is estimated that only 33 per cent., or a third, were likely to improve as a result of plans that local authorities have developed. When the same system was used in England, it was found that 63 per cent., or two thirds, of local authority services were likely to improve. That is interesting and worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been different responses to the report. Local government in Torfaen, the Secretary of State's constituency, reacted most positively in its response to a questionnaire from the Welsh Local Government Association:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are happy to share our own reflections on the first year of Best Value as a statutory duty through the WLGA ‘First Year Stocktake’ questionnaire. Our general view is that Best Value remains an important driver of change and of service improvement. There have of course been some problems in implementing the new framework, and we share the frustrations and irritations that have clearly prompted this questionnaire. However, the view of the political leadership of the authority, echoed by our own experience as officers, is that we are determined to make this work, and that we would not wish to throw the baby out with the bathwater."</p></blockquote>
I have a message from the Whip, who indicates that I should make my other points as briefly as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cultural problem that affects services in parts of Wales must be addressed by Government, whether in this place or in the Welsh Assembly. A MORI survey of local government officers and members in England and Wales reported a wide range of views about the audit. I had planned to read out several of them but will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Keep it for tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These matters are important to Plaid Cymru, as well as to everyone else. We are all responsible for service delivery; it is not simply that we need more money. Money helps, but we also have responsibility for ensuring that the money is spent wisely and effectively. The report highlighted another distinction:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A startling difference was seen between Welsh and English respondents to this question. Respondents from Welsh local authorities voiced the difficulties they had found complying with the statutory requirements for best value, 76% of respondents expressing difficulty".</p></blockquote>
In England, 37 per cent, expressed difficulty with exactly the same system. Why do Welsh local authorities find the system more difficult than English authorities? Perhaps part of the answer is given by a response to another question in the survey, which was
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
asked of officers but not members: how easy is it to get direction and support from members? In Wales, 38 per cent, said that it was easy; the figure for England was 51 percent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For whatever reason, there is a clear difference in attitude between some local authorities in Wales and the majority of local authorities in England. That is a worry, because the system is the same. If we reform the system—by all means, make it less bureaucratic—let us not take a position in Wales that, because difficult issues have been raised by an independent audit, the response should be to drop out of the audit, have nothing to do with it and set up our own system, which will not be so embarrassing. If we went down that road, we would be moving away from efficient public service delivery. Some parties might be happy with that, because they could carry on asking for more money without having to pay attention to how efficiently it is being used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should declare that I have a retail business in Swansea that employs eight people. Secondly—I think that I forgot to do this earlier—I thank the Secretary of State for giving me advance notice of his statement. It is his usual courtesy, and I am grateful for that. I, at least, intend to stick to the Labour party Whip's request and speak for only 10 minutes. I will cover four important topics, which are manufacturing in Wales, Swansea airport, the national health service and agriculture. I hope that the Secretary of State will take my comments on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that manufacturing in Wales is important. More people are employed in it as a percentage of the population than in the rest of the UK and it forms more of our gross domestic product: 27 per cent, in Wales compared with 20 per cent, in the rest of the UK. Therefore, all hon. Members and everyone involved in politics and business in Wales should be concerned by the large reduction in the manufacturing base in Wales. In December 1997,218,000 people were employed in it, but by June 2001 that was down to 197,000. Indeed, it was reported yesterday that 113 workers at the Meridian Foods plant in north Wales would lose their jobs. The report said also that the announcement brought the job losses in the region to approximately 1,000 in two months. It mentioned 436 job losses at Corning in Deeside, 189 at Alcoa, 124 at Trefn, and 90 at Burlington toiletries. Manufacturing is important, and we should all be concerned by those job losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also be concerned about the amount of rules and regulations that are heaped on our businesses. I am not the biggest fan of the European Union, but when, after surveying 4,000 companies throughout Europe, it states that Britain is the least competitive EU member, with more rules and regulations than any other country, we should listen carefully. It was estimated that there were more than 3,000 extra rules and regulations at an annual cost of £10 billion. Wales will have more than its fair share.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
One costly example is the climate change levy and we must examine how that will affect manufacturing in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned this earlier to the Secretary of State, but another important matter is the supplementary business rate. He could give me no assurances on it, because he said that it is the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales, but I hope that he will at least make representations. The Confederation of British Industry in Wales stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The differing transitional arrangements for business rates in Wales compared to England already places Wales at a competitive disadvantage. The National Assembly would send the wrong message to the business community and investors if it were to seek primary powers to levy a supplementary rate on business. This must not be pursued."</p></blockquote>
I do not want businesses in Wales clobbered or put at a competitive disadvantage to other parts of the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State must lobby to ensure that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Members spoke about the importance of the public services. They are vital and I agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) that it is not just the amount of money that is spent, but how it is spent. It must be effectively spent and the audit report said that £25 million could be saved in Wales if there was better management of our hospital estates. That means £25 million could be saved, not to go back to the Treasury, but to be funnelled back into the health service to provide a better, more efficient service for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine how the money is created and we need good and vibrant businesses in Wales to create wealth. We know that the United States is officially in recession, that there was an economic downturn there before 11 September and that it will be worse post-11 September. The percentage of gross domestic product for businesses in Wales is already forecast to decline and the CBI business trend survey talks about Wales operating at 41 per cent, below capacity. Orders are said to be declining by 19 per cent, and business confidence is down. In that light, we must determine what we can do to support Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that many powers now reside with the National Assembly. Is it not time that someone was based there as an economic development secretary—someone separate from the leader, who can concentrate on providing assistance to businesses in Wales? The two jobs should be separated. Will the Secretary of State talk to Rhodri Morgan and explain the importance of supporting Welsh businesses in that way? It is useless having two jobs, and it is useless being besotted with the name of the Welsh Assembly rather than with businesses in Wales. It is important to make effective use of taxpayers' money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
he gave one job up and allowed someone else to do a dedicated job of meeting the needs of businesses in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak briefly about Swansea airport. What is happening there is most exciting. Everyone knows that I originate from Swansea and I remember its airport once being like a glorified car boot sale. It is now under new ownership and much money is being invested. West Wales is one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, so a vibrant airport operating in Swansea could provide a tremendous boost to other parts of west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some strange reason, development seems to stop at Cardiff. The time gap between Cardiff and Swansea acts as a disadvantage and a disincentive for people to invest. I hope that the Secretary of State will soon visit Swansea airport. Air Wales now runs a successful operation between Dublin and Swansea. Flights to Cork have already commenced and flights to Jersey will start soon. If we could encourage a London-Swansea route, other business people might start to view Wales more seriously as worthy of investment— perhaps even further west than Swansea. We should provide as much encouragement as possible to Swansea airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman is a high flier himself and that sometimes he comes down with a crash landing. I would appreciate any help that any hon. Member can provide to improve the transport system in Wales, which includes Swansea and other airports throughout the country. I refer expressly to Swansea airport because I know it and because it has been lumbered with many disadvantages in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot do justice to the national health service in the time allowed. We all know that waiting lists are much higher than they were four and a half years ago. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) spoke of a 900 per cent, increase, which is totally unforgivable. We must consider how better to spend our money. Jane Hutt's reforms—replacing the five area health authorities with 22 local health bodies, 12 health partnerships and three regional members' offices—are not the answer. The NHS Confederation in Wales said that the plans would make the NHS
	<br><blockquote><p>"less accountable, offer worse value for money and consist of too many separate bodies".</p></blockquote>
We should examine how to ensure that the £49 million, so proudly announced by the Secretary of State, is effectively deployed. Between 22 bodies, it will be little more than £2 million each—hardly any money at all. It could be much better centred and controlled. Setting up 22 local health bodies with a commissioning role will not help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what happened to the NHS (Wales) Bill, which was mentioned in the Queen's Speech? Are we to expect more to follow the NHS reforms that have already been mentioned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
The total cost of alleviating the disaster of foot and mouth disease that has befallen the United Kingdom, including compensation to farmers, was £2.7 billion. The Government said that if the disease had been better controlled from the outset, the number of animals that had to be culled could have been cut by half, which would have been an enormous saving to the Treasury and the agriculture industry. It is a crying shame that the Prime Minister is intent on not having a full public inquiry. The matter was raised at Prime Minister's Question Time today. It is right that the Government set up an inquiry into BSE; the Conservative Government was wrong not to do so. But it is right, too, for the Government to set up an immediate inquiry into foot and mouth, because it has enormous cost implications and there are repercussions throughout the United Kingdom. It is amazing that we may have to wait until the European Parliament sets up an independent inquiry before there is a full and thorough answer to what befell this country and before recommendations are made on how better to manage a further outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a lot of spin; we need more assistance to help businesses throughout Wales to create the money that the Chancellor announced for spending on public services. We want the public services to deliver better for Wales than they are doing at present. We need to help our businesses so that we can help our public services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind what you said, Mr. Griffiths, I shall try to keep my contribution brief and let other hon. Members speak. I should have been delighted to take part in a debate with the grim reaper, the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr, on the gloom and doom in Wales, a country that I did not recognise in earlier comments. However, I want to clarify what I thought was a misleading point about gross domestic product per capita in Wales. There is no question but that GDP has been growing steadily since the election of a Labour Government in 1997. The discussion about relative growth in GDP is a completely different debate and I hope that that is made clear on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have taken part in a debate with the jolly miller, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik), who is prepared to go into the euro at any cost, whatever damage it does to the economy. He wanted the Chancellor to start spending frivolously from day one of a Labour Government, before we could assess the damage that had been done to the country by the most financially incompetent Government we had probably ever seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, it is worthwhile dwelling on the hon. Gentleman's point that, if GDP elsewhere rises faster than in Wales, Wales will fall back relative to the average, even though Welsh GDP may be rising.

	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's point. I was delighted with the Chancellor's statement and with the statement this morning about the impact on Wales, which is good news for my constituents. There will be continued, dramatic improvements on top of the nearly 70 per cent, drop in youth unemployment in the Vale of Glamorgan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Welsh questions recently, I drew attention to the dramatic decline in crime. There is a direct correlation between the improvement in youth unemployment and the corresponding decline in crime. Unemployment is down nearly 40 per cent, in my constituency and many families and individuals there will benefit enormously and directly from the Chancellor's statement. Approximately 13,500 pensioners and 12,200 families are in receipt of one of the new tax credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the relative difference in GDP growth in Wales compared to the rest of the UK, because we must tackle that issue. The Chancellor referred to it in his speech—he spoke about regional development strategies to tackle the iniquity of varying growth rates in different regions of a fairly small country, which we should take seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus on the existing transport infrastructure, to which the Chancellor referred, which is a major problem in Wales. One reason why we fell back in the 18 years of Tory misrule was precisely because of the lack of investment in our railways and roads to make us an integral part of the UK and European marketplace. One of the most important considerations for any investor, apart from costs in general, is access to the market. Being seen as on the periphery of the market because it is not possible to get a train or to drive there quickly enough is a serious problem. I recognise that most of the functions of transport investment and transport infrastructure have been devolved. I know that a statement has been produced by the Assembly on a vision for transport. Aspects of that statement worry me a little. There is no mention of two of the most important and biggest transport and road investments that we should receive in Wales if we want to narrow that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One area that does affect the House and the Committee is regional airports and airport strategy. I never thought I would, but I agree with the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) about Swansea. Having a viable airport network in Wales is not a luxury, but a necessary condition for the regeneration of the Welsh economy. We need a viable international airport as part of our infrastructure. If we do not tackle that problem, we will not grow as an economy in the way that we should in Wales. We are in danger of slipping back. It is not just a question of attracting new investment and new jobs. We may lose existing investment in Wales if we are not seen to have an airport that can provide us with the business links that will be essential in the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a modern airport. I am sure that my colleagues on both sides of the Committee Room have seen it. It has the capacity to take up to 4 million passengers per year. It has modern baggage handling. It looks like an international airport, but it is not. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
do not have regular scheduled business flights or any flights throughout the world, as it is predominantly charter business; until we do, we have a serious problem. The White Paper on aviation is coming out next year after the Chancellor's Budget statement. That is an area where we in this House can make a contribution. That White Paper looks specifically at the development of regional airports and what we need to do to create viable regional airports and hub airports within those regions to feed into the centre and then to feed out internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an influence over rail transport through the Strategic Rail Authority. The Vale of Glamorgan line will skirt the airport. If we provide a proper link, a spur or some sort of access, we can get the passengers to the airport. If we cannot find a way of getting them to the airport, we will never achieve our objective, which is shared by the overwhelming majority of Welsh businesses and business leaders. The Cardiff chamber of commerce puts the creation of a viable international airport as its number one transport objective in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important aspect is to provide within the next five years surface road access to that airport, linking it to the motorway. I am not too bothered whether we do that with a dual carriageway, a separate road, or a direct motorway link. If we do not find a way of providing that road within the next five years for the Welsh economy's sake, we will have a serious problem, but it is noticeably absent from the transport document. We can use the White Paper as a mechanism to make representations to the responsible bodies to ensure that we get the road. There is no question about the priority that it should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cardiff chamber of commerce recently produced a report saying without any equivocation that an international airport is the key asset in any regional development initiative. There is not a single region in the world that has successfully regenerated its economy or generated it from scratch without an international airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish, reluctantly, by citing last Monday's statement by Digby Jones, the Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry and probably the single most influential business person in the country, at a meeting of leading Welsh business figures and the great and the good just across the road from here. He says that, to the best of his knowledge, Cardiff international airport is the only airport in the world that feeds a capital city where someone can be stuck behind a milk float for nine miles trying to reach it. I hope that my hon. Friends will think about this issue and that the Minister will address it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I raise that again now, because it is important for us to recognise that if we are to create a new and prosperous Wales of full employment, there must be partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
That strategy is an ambitious document, setting out clear targets for the development of the Welsh economy in the next decade. It talks about the creation of 135,000 extra jobs in Wales and has less specific targets on improving learning opportunities and electronic communications. The document says that the National Assembly will be working towards an increase in Welsh GDP from 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the United Kingdom average. Ultimately, the aim is parity within the UK. That is an extremely ambitious target and it is important to recognise that it will be achieved only when we work collectively for the common good of our country. Such partnership requires working with local authorities, which are a vital part of the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we must recognise that Wales has a role to play in the wider European Union and we must ensure that the structural funds that we fought so hard to receive, particularly objective 1 funds, are put to the best possible use. I am pleased that, despite the undoubted initial difficulties, structural funds for objective 1 areas in west Wales and the valleys are now being put to very good use. We shall see a material benefit from those grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the support of the British Government is also vital. As we heard this morning, it is beyond doubt that Britain's macro-economic policies have been outstandingly successful since 1997. We have low inflation, low interest rates and a stable economy, rather than boom and bust, which was such a liability in the past. However, the role of central Government, here in London, goes beyond providing that macro-economic framework. It still has a vital role concerning broader economic policy and especially labour market policy. We must recognise that although great progress has been made in Wales in recent years, there is still a problem with unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, in communities that have experienced acute social deprivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased a few weeks ago when the Under-Secretary for Wales came to Llancaiach Fawr in my constituency to make an award to the 25,000th young person in Wales to have found a job under the new deal. I was pleased and proud that it was presented in my constituency, although the recipient came from my hon. Friend's constituency. Real opportunities are being provided for young people in Wales. However, more work needs to be done to provide support, assistance and encouragement for the long-term unemployed. That is important for those who are experiencing unemployment and in tackling the wider issue of social exclusion. I firmly believe that social exclusion will be brought to an end only when we have full employment in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my own experience of one of the more innovative methods that have been adopted in south Wales to encourage people off welfare into work. An employment zone has been established covering the boroughs of Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen and Caerphilly and it has been very successful in the past 18 months. Some 1,800 people, mostly over the age of 25, have been given support, training and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
encouragement—600 have found work, 89 per cent, of whom have remained in work after 13 months. Those are impressive figures because the people concerned had been unemployed for long periods. Many had never worked and some are working for the first time in middle age. They are creating new life chances for themselves. Within the employment zone is an action team that is working with some of the most disadvantaged and disaffected individuals. I am pleased that that pilot scheme will be extended in the very near future and that there will be three schemes: one in north Wales and two in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such innovative measures to create real job opportunities for the long-term unemployed are a huge step forward. The Government's commitment to such innovative action was reaffirmed in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report. I am also pleased that, as we have heard this afternoon, more resources will be provided in Wales so that innovative measures such as the job transition service will be reinforced still further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor's statement was very good. It included a number of important measures for Wales. I have referred to labour market measures, but there were others, not least the reduction in stamp duty on property sales up to £150,000, which will help constituencies throughout Wales that experience poverty and deprivation. I welcome the support for research and development, the simplification of the VAT regime for businesses and the widening of the 10p corporation tax band for small businesses, which will encourage innovation, enterprise, growth and, ultimately, prosperity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may say, "We'd expect Wayne David to make warm comments about the statement." However, I ask them to read today's edition of 	<i>The Western Mail</i>. That newspaper sometimes gets things wrong when expressing its own opinions, but when it quotes other people, it usually does so accurately. I should like to share with the Committee some quotes that reflect the general response of people in Wales to the pre-Budget statement. Felicity Williams, deputy general secretary, Wales TUC, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chancellor's announcements are welcomed. He has rightly rejected those calling for him to choose between public services and fighting poverty."</p></blockquote>
We might expect the deputy general secretary, Wales TUC to say that. However, the Chancellor also had a vote of confidence from John Foster Thomas, senior tax partner of Deloitte & Touche in Cardiff, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The measures announced will continue the Chancellor's drive to encourage enterprise for all—measures that will be of particular benefit to the SME-dominated Welsh economy."</p></blockquote>
Nigel Lawson of the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I was just making sure that hon. Members were paying attention—Russell Lawson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I welcome the Chancellor's Pre-Budget report but I feel that the proposals don't go far enough."</p></blockquote>
That is reasonable praise from the federation. Finally, David Rosser, director of CBI Wales, was unequivocal. He said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I applaud Mr. Brown for delivering a sensible and supportive pre-budget package at a time when there is economic uncertainty."</p></blockquote>
That is praise indeed, and the spirit of those objective, honest statements is shared by the great mass of people in Wales. That is why I believe that the report is one that is good for business, for enterprise, for the least well-off people in Wales and, above all, for Wales as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the plea of the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) to establish Cardiff airport as an international airport. That would make an important contribution to the economy of south Wales. It is even more important to improve access to the airport. The first time that I drove there, I almost gave up because I did not know where I was going—I thought that I was disappearing into deep countryside rather than making my way to the airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that when the film star Michael Douglas and his new Welsh wife, Catherine Zeta Jones, arrived at Cardiff, the local taxi drivers sneaked through the lanes of the Vale of Glamorgan, describing that as the scenic route to Swansea, because they were terrified of getting stuck in a traffic jam?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan was very encouraging about the state of the economy in Wales. Perhaps, given all the encouragement and opportunities that he enjoys because his constituency is on the M4 corridor, and the resulting advantages for the economy, he has a more sanguine view of the economy than I do. Having gone round my constituency and the rest of Wales, I am less optimistic about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must admit that many of the manufacturing industries in Wales are having a very tough time. The uncertainly about our entry into the euro and the inept handling of the currency configuration means that our exchange rate does not reflect our relative competitiveness. Therefore, many companies are finding it difficult to export and many others have difficulty competing against the volume of cheap imports coming into the domestic market. The manufacturing industries are not the only ones that are suffering from the exchange rate—agriculture is virtually being blitzed out of existence, suffering from the competition of cheap imports and the effect on subsidies that are paid in the European currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking of agriculture, the foot and mouth epidemic has been horrific. A huge amount of public money has been spent on it; money that would have been welcome had it been spent on public services in Wales and the rest of Britain. I have done a little research, and believe that the £2.7 billion that was mentioned by the Chancellor is money that has already been spent; it is not new money. His announcement yesterday provided was no additional money for farming and rural businesses affected by the epidemic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
Lord Haskins has recently produced a report on the state of the rural economy in Cumbria, as a result of which the Government have agreed to give £24 million to the area to aid its recovery. I understand that the money will be in addition to that in the rural recovery fund, which has operated regionally. Is such money being made available in Wales? The Farmers Union of Wales said in a press release that nothing had been done for the consequential losses suffered by farming and rural businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might be aware that some of my constituents and people from Cumbria, Devon and other areas in Britain are contemplating a class action in law against the Government. It would be better if the Government responded to their needs and the imperative to secure their businesses by meeting them and talking about the problem rather than letting the matter go to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Buried deeply in the statement is a commitment to review the way in which annuities operate in relation to pensions. I was impressed by the constructive contribution made by the hon. Member for Newport, West on pensions in general. We all believe that pensioners, who have given so much to our country through their work and their contribution to society and communities, should be rewarded in their old age. It is a disgrace that although we are the fourth largest economy in the world, we cannot treat our pensioners better. Some parts of yesterday's announcement make us optimistic, but too many pensioners still find life tough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about pensions for the self-employed, who do not have the benefit of occupational pensions and have to make provision for themselves. They are being urged to do so, but their aim to provide for themselves and give themselves independence in retirement has been dealt four great hammer blows. The abolition of advanced corporation tax, one of the Government's first measures on taking office, meant that the potential pension fund of all those who planned responsibly for their retirement would be 20 per cent, less than they had expected. The poor performance of the pension funds, which is linked to poor stock market performance, and high charges by the pension providers have also had a significant effect. The Government should consider what is happening and how they can tackle it, especially in relation to high charges. The current low rate of annuities means that people who planned for their retirement will have virtually half the pension that they had expected. That will make the difference between living comfortably and in absolute poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that this morning the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire described Liberal Democrat policy as being honest about taxation. He may also recall my speech, in which I described the proposed taxation commitments in relation to health. He asks for money for agriculture and the agricultural community, and for pensions. Will he suggest how the Liberal Democrats intend those taxation proposals to be paid for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could send the hon. Gentleman a copy of our manifesto. There is much hilarity from time to time about the lp that we propose to improve health delivery in Wales and the rest of the country. The problem would be much easier to solve if the Government and the Conservative Government had not cut taxation on a regular basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, if we are sending the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central a copy of our manifesto, we should also underline the parts about closing national insurance loopholes to put the money specifically into pensions? I remind the Committee that it was our manifesto, and ours alone, that the broad spectrum of commentators during the general election said actually added up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the announcement that there will be an inquiry into the other ways in which annuities can be secured. At the moment, people are so disenchanted with their returns that they are not commuting their pensions. There is a great deal of uncertainty. I also welcome the abolition of stamp duty in the most deprived wards. However, the Secretary of State should not be boasting that there are deprived wards in every local authority in Wales. If it is good to abolish stamp duty in certain wards in Wales, perhaps we should abolish it on sums up to £150,000 anyway. Such a reduction of the cost involved would really encourage people to take the huge step of buying their first house. It would also encourage businesses to invest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today, the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire about the statistics on waiting lists in Wales. I have been through all the statistics and I cannot find anything approaching 900 per cent. I do not know at what time of night the hon. Gentleman was doing his research, but he must have made some mistakes in allocating the noughts or decimal points. If there are any problems in relation to that, I will refer the matter to the relevant Ministers in the Assembly and perhaps they will be able to help the constituents involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome many items contained in the pre-Budget statement. We will be working with everybody for the benefit of Wales. We will be 100 per cent, behind all those people who are putting their efforts into securing the economy, the society and the communities of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). He represents a farming community that was badly hit by foot and mouth, as my constituency was. I am sure that he will agree that not only could some of the money spent on foot and mouth have been spent on public services, but some of it could have been invested in agricultural infrastructure. We might have avoided some of the problems, especially those involving the long distances that so much livestock has to travel to be slaughtered.

	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
I am pleased to welcome the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement, which takes a positive approach to investment in public services, the principles and ethos of the national health service, support for working families, support for small businesses and ensuring long-term employment and economic growth. That is most refreshing and markedly different from 18 years of Conservative Government and from the principles that the Conservative party stands for today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is not here. It is indicative that, once again, there are no Conservative Members of Parliament in Wales. I am sorry to have disappointed him, if he waited up until 5 am on 8 June earlier this year only to realise that, when I was elected, we ensured that for two successive Sessions of Parliament, there were no Conservative Members. The Conservative ideology was one of cutbacks in public services, reducing the role of the state, undermining the ethos of the national health service, ignoring the problems of poverty among families and pensioners and denying the rights of employees, especially the low-paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor's Budgets and pre-Budget statements have a consistent theme: that we can combine economic growth with combating social exclusion. Those two projects can go hand in hand. Only by addressing the problems of social exclusion can we widen the opportunities for everybody to have access to education and training. We must combat health inequalities, address the inequalities that pervade the labour market and the disadvantages faced by many women, the low-paid, and part-time workers. It is to the credit of the Government that those disadvantages are being tackled through the national minimum wage, the working families tax credit, the European social chapter, the new deal and the Jobcentre Plus, and through the Employment Bill currently going through the House. As hon. Members have said, we now have the lowest unemployment for 25 years. That is something that everyone who believes in the Labour movement and socialism should celebrate. We have heard criticism within the party that we have not been socialist enough, but the policy of full employment is a truly socialist policy, and all our friends and colleagues should support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has identified three policy areas where spending is due to increase substantially, although I accept that the distribution between those areas may be different in Wales. Education spending is due to grow by 5.6 per cent., health spending by 5.7 per cent, and transport spending by an average of 14 per cent, each year. Those increases will make important inroads in responding to the challenges in our public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take the opportunity of identifying some of the priorities for Monmouthshire, to which the Chancellor's investment in public services provides a response. In education, we need more investment in the tertiary sector, or further education. This week, a new equestrian animal health centre will open at Coleg Gwent agricultural division in Usk. More staff should
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
be appointed on full-time salaries, rather than on part-time, hourly paid lecturing staff salaries. We will need to respond to the new era in Wales in post-16 education, when ELWa—Education and Learning Wales—fully takes over responsibility for it. I hope that the early years programme, especially sure start, will develop. I was delighted to visit the sure start programme in Abergavenny recently, but if that programme is necessary for Abergavenny, it is also necessary in Chepstow, Monmouth and every community in which people—especially young women—could benefit from that initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national health strategy in Wales needs developing, too, with the introduction of the Assembly's new health policy. I generally support the reorganisation that Jane Hutt is introducing, although it is 30 years overdue. By having a structure in the health service that is coterminous with local authorities, we may encourage collaboration between health and social services. Aneurin Bevan said that a national health service could equalise the best, but that was never really applied to mental health services. I hope that one of the beneficiaries of the new structure will be the mental health services in Wales, especially in the southern end of my constituency, where there are serious weaknesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issue of transport. The Welsh Affairs Committee is considering that issue, and I have written to members of the Committee to ask them to investigate bus monopolies operated by companies such as Stagecoach in my constituency and in that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. A bus monopoly by Stagecoach has led to the deterioration of services. I remind hon. Members that in Gloucester, Stagecoach has recently been fined £8,000 for providing an inadequate service, following a public inquiry. I suggest that there should be similar inquiries in other parts of Wales where the bus service is not as good as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to support my campaign to change the law on overcrowding on scheduled bus services. I was amazed to discover recently that completely different standards apply to scheduled bus services compared with designated school bus services. A 48-seater designated school bus can take only 48 pupils because everyone has to have a seat and wear a seatbelt, and no one can stand. On a scheduled bus service, however, a 48-seater bus can take 72 people under the age of 14, plus up to 20 standing. Therefore, 92 passengers under 14 are allowed on a scheduled bus. That is a staggering figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In conclusion, I am sure that the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement will be supported by my constituents and by those who see in it the benefits for business, public services, working families and pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I referred earlier to several statutory instruments being passed behind the back of the National Assembly for Wales. The actual figures are as follows. Between 1 January 2000 and July 2001, 120 statutory instruments relating to Wales were passed—62 in Westminster and 58 in the National Assembly.

With reference to partnership, the Secretary of State will know that the National Assembly wrote to him with something of a shopping list that included national insurance credit and capital allowance. Some of those things were mentioned by the Chancellor but several were not. In the interests of the partnership that we are discussing, I hope that there will be further developments in the coming months. Of course, during the past five years gross domestic product has grown in absolute terms in Wales. However, GDP growth has been poor in Wales compared with the rest of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, the Secretary of State's speech was something of a retread of previous speeches. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] It was a retread and contained nothing new. None the less, we all welcome the provisions for pensioners, which, I am sure, will help those who need them. Likewise, tax credits, and we have already discussed the abolition of stamp duty and the various other matters referred to by the Chancellor yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big problem—this has been acknowledged by several hon. Members in the debate today—is that the UK economy might be doing well, but there are hot spots and black spots. Wales has too many black spots, and there are no provisions designed specifically to deal with them. That is why I hope that the partnership can be developed, so that we can assist our colleagues in Wales to deliver on some of those issues. Of course, we are responsible for delivering on several of them, but we expect our colleagues to work to deliver others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire made a speech that was typically helpful to new Labour in its historical analysis of the obvious, references to Tory underspend, and so on. He mentioned the figure of £2.7 billion and graciously thanked the Government for no new money. Obviously, he had done his homework once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, the hon. Member for Newport, West, made a thoughtful and thought-provoking speech, which was also informative and well researched. He declared an interest in that he is nearer to a pensionable age than most of us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are all past it, but the hon. Gentleman made a thought-provoking speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the same theme, the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr gave a great performance in his maiden speech to a Welsh Grand Committee. He dealt with public services generally and mentioned that spending on UK education as a proportion of GDP is at a 40-year low. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports a 25-year low in public investment in Wales, so there is much to be done. The hon. Gentleman made a lively speech and took many interventions, as was appropriate in the circumstances. We hope that the National Assembly for Wales will have the power to borrow to invest because that is important. We should also be considering operating aid, a real issue affecting businesses. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned tax incentives in his constructive contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan) made a tub-thumping, optimistic speech, in which he talked up the economy with little regard to the facts. He acknowledged regional variations in the economy but said that everything was fine in his constituency. A little later, in the afternoon, he said that he welcomed the pilot scheme because of long-term heavy unemployment. I know that he has a duty to the Government as well as to his constituents but he seemed to be a little confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire spoke about paying back the national debt. The bulk of the businesses in her constituency—as in mine—are small to medium enterprises. There are measures in the statement that will help, such as VAT simplification, and I welcome those. I am sure that we all share the hon. Lady's goal of full employment. That is the real way to do away with social exclusion, as has been pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central made a long and interesting speech. He served in the Welsh Office and was the Minister in charge of health, and I have no doubt that he was speaking from experience. His remarks were thoughtful and thought-provoking and they will no doubt engender further discussion along the useful lines that he set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley—who is not in his place, but that is nothing new—referred to the reduction in the manufacturing base in Wales, from the December 1997 figure of 218,000 people employed in manufacturing jobs to the latest figure of 197,000. He referred to Alcoa, in my constituency, and the job losses in Waunarlwydd, although I am not sure what Government intervention is called for. The hon. Gentleman showed concern about job losses, referring to the CBI, and also made a strong and impassioned plea for Swansea airport, which I expect all hon. Members present supported. He referred to the proposed reorganisation of the health service in Wales—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Gentleman is now in his place. He also criticised the Government for their handling of the foot and mouth outbreak.

His plea for better links with Cardiff airport was right, of course. He is persistent and correct in his approach to something that would benefit not only his area, but all Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) referred to the national economic strategy document and the partnership that we need to build with our Cardiff colleagues. He referred to unemployment problems in Wales and what he called the macro-economic success of the Labour Government. I am sure that we all agree with his statement that the way to deal with social exclusion is to aim for full employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just before yesterday's statement we approached the Government to suggest various operating aids for objective 1 areas. I hope that we can proceed with that. Our party's view on the matter is now echoed by the National Assembly for Wales. We need to build on that consensus. Large areas of Wales have objective 1 status, so we are in a position to consider operating aids. Those are important tools which we have not used so far, although clearly we should. We are interested also in the creation of designated enterprise zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cuts in corporation tax have been mentioned. Of course they are most welcome, especially in the small and medium sector. However, we would also like an increase in regional selective assistance, which was not mentioned yesterday; I doubt whether it will be mentioned today either. We called for a fairer and simplified VAT system. That, apparently, will be introduced, and it is also welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall still differ over the old chestnut of full matched funding for European structural funds. We continue to take the view that we have been sold short. We need to step up our efforts—unless we are careful we shall have missed an opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Besides job creation, a purpose of objective 1 is job enhancement and the protection of jobs. We are now in an era when we need to protect jobs in Wales. I am personally involved in the case of the Dolgarrog Alcoa redundancies, which involves 189 jobs in a rural area. It is a devastating blow, as I am sure hon. Members will realise. I welcome the rapid reaction idea, which is of course helpful. However, we would not support the use of operating aids and all the tools available with respect to objective 1 to enable us to approach businesses that were showing signs of being in difficulty and tell them, "We can give you a corporation tax holiday or incentives; we can enable you to carry on".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Corus would not have accepted that approach in any circumstances. It was hell bent on moving out. However, there must be firms in Wales in
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
a precarious position. We should be able to help them. Politics is the art of the possible, and we ought to utilise every economic and fiscal tool that we can to assist them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to operating aids on several occasions. Does he not recognise that the European Commission frowns on any attempt to derogate parts of individual member states from operating aids? There is a presumption in favour of uniformity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission may frown on that, but a huge area outside Barcelona has every operating aid on God's earth. Why do we not have them as well?

The National Assembly for Wales should have the right to borrow money to invest. We have asked for that, and we hope that it will be considered. We would like the link between pensions and average earnings to be put back as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural areas have again been given no comfort. I shall not discuss the £2.7 billion announced yesterday, which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire generously acknowledged. It is not new money: it is money that has been spent or is committed to be spent. It will give no joy to thousands of Welsh farms and rural businesses, which I am afraid are being sold down the river yet again. The manufacturing base is also shrinking. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I will complete my remarks. I apologise to the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) for not dealing with their speeches in detail, but I have run out of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall impression of yesterday's speech is that it dealt with the macro-economic picture of the rosy south-east, but there was nothing in it for parts of the UK that are faltering, including Wales, the north-east and Liverpool. The clear message from the Committee should be that we need to work on regional economic policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Don Touhig)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, we have had a robust and vigorous debate. It has highlighted the real merits of the package announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday, and 14 Members have taken part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 is a golden opportunity for us, but it must not become a comfort blanket. Our long-term aim must surely be to put ourselves in a position from which we can succeed economically without such special help. That is the Government's aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday's package is another step towards Wales achieving long-term economic strength that will enable it to decide and shape its destiny within the United Kingdom. We have set out our priorities, as the Chancellor did yesterday. It must be abundantly clear to everyone that the Government are looking at the long term. We have a long-term ambition to develop the economy in Wales and the UK. Wales more than anywhere else should appreciate the merits of such an approach. Few parts of the UK boomed as much as Wales did when coal was king, but then it suffered the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
consequences of the downturn after the first world war. Few parts of the UK have experienced busts as Wales has. Our history shows dramatically how important steady, long-term economic growth is, and the measures outlined yesterday by my right hon. Friend will move us towards securing that growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short time available, I want to respond to as many hon. Members as possible. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire rightly drew attention to the appalling record on job losses and company closures under the Tory Government. He chastised our Government for holding to the previous Government's spending limits when we took office, which surprised me because the Liberal Democrats' 1997 election manifesto called not for a two-year freeze but a five-year freeze on spending. I have a copy if he wants me to pass it on to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We stuck to the previous Government's spending records for two years. In that time, we dramatically reduced the national debt, gave independence to the Bank of England and set new, low inflation targets. As a result, despite the world downturn, the economy is still growing, inflation is at its lowest for a generation, we have the lowest rates of any of our major competitors and 30,000 more people are now in work in Wales than when we came into power in 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Under-Secretary knows, his party endlessly made jokes about the fact that for many years we supported an increase in income tax to put money into education. His point about our wanting to maintain the Tories' spending plans for five years is simply incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have that information here and will pass it on to the hon. Gentleman later, because I do not want to take up time by quoting from his party's manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West spoke eloquently on behalf of pensioners, as he has in the House. He reminded us that they were cheated in the Tory years, and he welcomed the measures that the Government have introduced to improve their quality of life. His contribution was well informed and well argued, although I cannot agree with him on the question of restoring the link, which was a point also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central in an intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West should take two issues into account. The first, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiif, Central, is the affordability in the long term of restoring the link. Secondly, and more importantly, by restoring the link we would not necessarily improve the lot of the poorest pensioners. By pursuing our policy, we are helping the poorest pensioners, which must be an absolute priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr showed his skill in the debate, as he needed to, because his argument was so weak. He was very selective in the statistics that he used, and I commend the advice given him by my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
for Cardiff, Central about statistics. He should be wary of throwing them around like confetti, as he did this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not welcome public-private partnerships, which is in sharp contrast to the response of Plaid Cymru-run Caerphilly council. It has welcomed the money to build two new comprehensives, one of which is a Welsh-medium school. He also referred to worries about operating aids. There have been significant developments as regards operating aids in objective 1 and non-objective 1 areas. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of" State described in his statement how we would help people in Wrexham and Cardiff to get into work through new projects and the new deal. We hope that those projects will be successful and will be extended throughout Wales. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced important measures for tax credits for research and development. A company is being established in my constituency that will create 500 new jobs, and is committed to developing a partnership with the Ministry of Defence and the university for research and development. That is good news, and should be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr made great play of the issue of GDP, although the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) played that down a bit at the end, clearly recognising that his hon. Friend was using facts and figures like confetti. In the lifetime of this Government, GDP in Wales has increased. That should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire made an important speech, in which he stressed how valuable small and medium-sized enterprises are to Wales, as some 140,000 Welsh firms are SMEs. The Chancellor's announcement referred to easing the way for companies to pay their VAT, and payroll services and lower business taxes will also help small companies in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central welcomed the extra money for the national health service and, as a former Minister responsible for health in Wales, he made an important contribution to the debate. He recognised that there should be a major debate on how we might fund the continuing expansion of the health service. He made a contribution to that debate, and I hope that he will continue to do so in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley made some important points about manufacturing. We should put a few facts on the record. Yes, we have had problems with manufacturing, but the best help that we can give it is to have a sound economy, based on low interest rates and low inflation. We should note that despite the 2 per cent, slowdown this year in UK manufacturing, productivity is 13 per cent, higher than it was in 1997. The hon. Gentleman also made an important point about Swansea airport. I wish the project every success; it is important for that part of the world and I am sure that it will be good for Swansea and west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan welcomed the Chancellor's statement. He also welcomed the drop in youth unemployment in his constituency and in crime, to which he referred at Welsh questions a little while ago. He made a powerful case for improving access to Cardiff airport. It is the fastest growing regional airport in the United Kingdom, but difficult to access by road or by rail. I know that he is an articulate campaigner for improvements to that airport, and I wish him every success. In addition, he made points about the important matter of investment in transport infrastructure. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has already made it clear that the Government are committed to a £30 billion investment in the rail network over the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly talked of the economic development strategy of the National Assembly for Wales "A Winning Wales". He is right that it sets ambitious targets, especially that of increasing the GDP of Wales. He also mentioned unemployment—that has been a serious problem and we have taken some knocks during the past year with regard to job losses. However, the claimant count is now down in every constituency in Wales, and there are 30,000 more people in work than there were when the Government came into office. As we have seen with Corus and other companies, it is vital that we give every help possible when job losses occur. We must paint a picture of a vibrant, exciting and growing Wales. That is not the picture painted by Plaid Cymru Members. I did not even recognise the picture of Wales that was painted by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr this morning— [	<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Member for Ceredigion invites me to come west. He agreed with me in a recent debate in Westminster Hall that his constituency is the second fastest growing county in Wales after Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we give a show of confidence for the economy in Wales. When the Secretary of State and I encourage people to develop their businesses in Wales and to invest in Wales, we are not helped by members of Plaid Cymru, who paint a picture of gloom and doom, as though Wales is some economic desert or wasteland. That is not the truth. The quotes from people who support what the Chancellor said yesterday, read out by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly, reflect more accurately the views of the people of Wales than does the party that wants to tear
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Wales out from the rest of the United Kingdom. The thrust of the argument put by the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr was that they want two things from the United Kingdom—independence and money. That is not the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made an important point about the difficulties that face the self-employed in securing good pensions for themselves—that must be taken on board. He also mentioned unemployment. Unemployment in his constituency is, thankfully, quite low—it is 2.8 per cent., which is very good and much lower than it is in many parts of Wales. I do not agree that insufficient has been done to help the economy where it has been hit by foot and mouth disease. The Government have committed £2.7 billion to tackling the problem, as the Chancellor stated yesterday. He made it clear that the money is there—it would have been spent on other things, but the crisis has occurred and the money is being used to help areas hit by foot and mouth. Constituents in the hon. Gentleman's part of the world have also benefited from a £156 million agrimonetary compensation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture is not so damning as the hon. Gentleman paints it. There are problems, but by working in partnership with our colleagues in the Assembly, we are beginning to tackle them. My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth stressed the value of taking measures to combat social exclusion—it is important that we do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very good debate. If I can take a cue from what the Chancellor said yesterday, the next big issue that we will debate as a country will be how we can sustain, fund and develop the NHS. We are prepared to accept the consequences of trying to expand it and meet the additional demands that it faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of this Committee is that it provides an opportunity for the 40 Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies to come together and to articulate our hopes, aspirations and desires for the people of Wales. Wales does not end at the Severn bridge. This place is a vital part of the legislature and democracy, and long may that be so. I commend the Chancellor's statement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
