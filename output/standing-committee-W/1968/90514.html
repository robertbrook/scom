<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. George Thomas)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of health and welfare services in Wales.</p></blockquote>
I am sure the Committee will join with me in expressing our sorrow that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) is still not well enough to be with us. We wish him a speedy return to good health.<br><br>
The Welsh Office took a major step forward at the beginning of April when we were entrusted with responsibilities for the health and welfare services in Wales as well as with increased powers in agriculture and in tourism, and also with regard to our ancient monuments in Wales. I wish to pay tribute to the Welsh Board of Health, to the National Insurance Commissioners, who were their predecessors, and the Secretary of which was the illustrious father of our Minister of State. We are inheritors of a great legacy in the health service in Wales. The transfer of the health and welfare services gives me particular pleasure, for there is no part of the Government's activities which touches more closely the life of our people.<br><br>
It is a great advantage to us that there is but one Hospital Board for the whole of Wales and only one Board of Governors for teaching hospitals. This makes administration easier and relationship between the Government and those concerned in the administration of the service much closer.<br><br>
My colleagues and I have visited many hospitals in Wales in the seven weeks since we took over responsibility. I took early steps to meet the chairmen of every hospital management committee in Wales and the members of the Welsh Hospital Board, in addition to meeting the Board of Governors of the United Cardiff Hospitals. I shall shortly be meeting the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Welsh Executive Councils' Association and I have also to meet with the local authorities concerned with personal health and welfare services.<br><br>
I turn to the three main parts of the Health Service, and begin with that provided by the general medical practitioners. They are the people who generally see patients first and, in the main, manage the cases themselves. It is common knowledge that we have suffered from a shortage of general practitioners, but I am glad to say that we seem to have halted the downward trend. Four areas only are designated as being in special need of additional doctors. They are the areas of Mountain Ash Urban District Council, Pontypridd Urban District Council, Nantyglo and Blaina Urban District Council and Merthyr Tydfil Borough Council. But because of a rise in the population figures, the average number of patients per doctor has continued to rise slightly, and on 1st October, 1968, it stood at 2,231 compared with 2,229 in the previous year—an increase of two, which is neither here nor there. In any case, this figure compares very favourably with that for England.<br><br>
Obviously it is important that when people visit their doctor they should be received and treated in adequate premises and that doctors shall be freed so far as possible to concentrate on the medical aspects of a consultation, leaving a receptionist to deal with routine telephoning, making of appointments and the filing of records, and for a nurse to undertake the many jobs which require her knowledge and skills in the practice.<br><br>
A great deal of encouragement has been given to the formation of group practices, to health centres and to the improvement of existing practice premises. Likewise, encouragement has been given to the employment of staff to relieve general practitioners of non-medical work. Cooperation is the life essence of the Health Service. It is essential that local authorities, hospital authorities and general practitioners shall get together to work out common problems. Without this close cooperation we cannot have as efficient a Health Service as we all desire.<br><br>
I should now like to refer to the general dental services in Wales. There are some 393 dentists on the list of Welsh Executive Councils. I am not satisfied with the number of dentists practising in Wales, but I would draw the Committee's atten-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
tion to the work of the Dental Hospital and School which forms part of the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff.<br><br>
This hospital was opened on 1st October, 1965, and has already achieved its designated annual intake of 50 students. The first students qualified in 1968 and are now in practice. There has been, not surprisingly, a rapid increase in the number of patients seen at the Dental Hospital since it opened. In 1966, 5,150 patients were attended to. Last year, the figure reached 8,421.<br><br>
I want to tell the Committee more about the health centres in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend indicate the proportion of dental students who are entering the teaching hospitals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to see that my hon. Friend is supplied with the information in the course of the debate.<br><br>
I wish to refer to the health centres. At the end of 1965 there were six health centres only throughout Wales. By April this year the figure had reached 16 with another 11 under construction or with building about to start. Many more are now in the active planning stage. The continued expansion in the provision of health centres is one of the keys to the improvement of the Health Service in Wales.<br><br>
I now turn to the question of mental health. The overshadowing event in this field has been the Report on Ely Hospital which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services accepted on behalf of the Government a few days before we took over. I am not going to cover the whole of that Report, but it must be remembered that there is much dedicated service given in the Ely Hospital. During the past seven weeks, I have visited the Ely Hospital on three occasions, and I know that life has been very difficult for those who care for the 460 mentally subnormal patients in that hospital since the Report was published.<br><br>
No less than one-third of all our hospital beds in Wales are taken up by mental health cases, and there is no doubt in my mind that these unfortunate people must be given a higher priority in our considerations. We should remember that many of the mentally subnormal patients spend long years in the care of the hospital. Indeed, I met a patient at Ely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
who has been there for over 20 years. These are people who cannot fight for themselves, as articulate patients in our general hospitals are usually able to do. It is all too easy for the community to put out of its thoughts the needs of this minority, but I must tell the Committee that I feel they have a high claim on my consideration. One of the marks of a civilised community is that it cares properly for those who are not fit to care for themselves.<br><br>
A major problem that faces us is the fact that, although the numbers employed in our hospitals have risen substantially, staffing shortages still present difficulties. Indeed much of the troubles of hospitals such as Ely and Hensol Castle may fairly be attributed to shortage of staff.<br><br>
I believe it is particularly important that local authority health services and the Welsh Hospital authorities consider together the kind and amount of services that they are providing for these people. I have a very strong conviction that there are many who spend years in the hospital when they ought to be in the community. This is a serious matter. It must be our aim to enable someone who is subnormal or mentally ill to lead as normal a life as possible, preferably within their own family circle. Where this is not possible, for family or medical reasons, our aim should be to enable the person concerned to remain in the local community by providing domiciliary support and residential accommodation. A tremendous amount remains to be done in this field by local authorities.<br><br>
This leads me naturally to the question of the personal welfare services. I am glad to say that our local authorities are increasingly providing homes for those who need them because of age or infirmity. They are also providing purpose-built homes for our older folk, and they plan to provide some 8,600 places by 1976. Also provided is a wide range of services to assist the blind, the partially sighted, the deaf and the hard of hearing, and those with other handicaps. Naturally, I shall do all I can to encourage the continuous improvement and extension of these services within the limits of the finances available. Of course, there are limits, unless the community is prepared to pay more through taxation.<br><br>
The last subject with which I wish to deal is the service provided by the hos-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
pital authorities, and I know that a number of Members of the Committee have a deep interest in the hospital service.<br><br>
It is common ground that, as medical knowledge increases, specialisation increases. Diagnostic apparatus and treatment facilities become more and more complex, and hospitals, therefore, have to be larger, and serve more people from a wider area. The questions are: how large? How many people? How wide the area?<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
My own predisposition is against the over-large hospital. Social and medical considerations are important in assessing the size that our hospitals should be and the area that they seek to serve, and social considerations, like medical considerations, can never be out of the mind of a responsible Minister. I can assure the Committee and the people of Wales that I shall do my utmost to reach a right balance in these considerations.<br><br>
Obviously, the time is overdue for a reorganisation of our hospital services. It is only now that we are having new district hospitals built, and it would be foolish to expect that with the provision of new district hospitals we shall nonetheless want to keep open every one of our older and smaller hospitals, even though they were established by great sacrificial effort to meet the need of earlier generations.<br><br>
Radical change in the structure of the Health Service there must be if it is to meet the demands of the 1970s and the 1980s. I am entirely convinced that the younger generation will not be prepared to tolerate the smaller hospitals lacking expensive facilities which can be provided in the larger hospitals. I know that there will always be some people who resent change and who will resent the closure of a hospital anywhere. I take no pleasure in knowing that hospitals have to close, but I am in no doubt at all that the important question I have to bear in mind is that the hospital structure must be the most efficient we can provide for our people, taking into account such social considerations as I have already outlined.<br><br>
I conclude by assuring the Committee that my Ministerial colleagues in the Welsh Office and I regard it as a privilege and a challenge to be the pioneers in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
creating a Health Service tailored to meet the special needs of Wales. We pledge ourselves to this Committee and to the people of Wales to do everything in our power to ensure that there are close and friendly ties between Ministers and those involved in our health services. We shall make ourselves readily available to those who are engaged in the noble task of caring for the sick. One of our great advantages in Wales is that we are a small country, we can have closer relationships, and we intend to ensure that the Health Service for the Welsh people reflects the spirit and the attitude of our country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) may I appeal to hon. Members, a number of whom have expressed to me a desire to speak. If we can exercise self-denial I am sure that I shall be able to call all hon. Members who wish to speak; otherwise someone will be disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I first congratulate the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State on his fairly recent assumption of responsibility for health in the Principality.<br><br>
It is opportune that we should have this debate today; first, because it is a long time since we debated health matters in the Grand Committee, and, secondly, because of the transfer of this function to the Welsh Office. These are two good reasons. It is a formidable addition to the responsibilities of the right hon. Gentlemen, and I am sure that he will not regard it as a sinecure or as a marginal addition to his work.<br><br>
Today's subject matter is extremely important. It is not non-political, because there are party differences on this subject, particularly in relation to methods of financial support for the Health Service. Recent events, including the decision of the Government to increase certain charges for dentures and spectacles, suggest that even party differences may not be quite so wide as in the past. Harsh economic and financial realities have obliged the Government to adopt some policies to which their Labour predecessors would have objected strongly, but we can justly claim that in many respects this subject transcends party differences, for all of us must be prepared to abandon some of our parti-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
san preconceptions and to avail ourselves of the best technical and professional advice.<br><br>
Our National Health Service—our hospital service, the general medical service and the various welfare services to all of which the right hon. Gentleman referred—has some notable virtues, but I think he will agree that it also has defects.<br><br>
In the United Kingdom as a whole—and the position in Wales is fairly similar—the National Health Service is now costing more than £1,600 million per year. Of this, I understand that 60 per cent. is borne by the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures are, 85 per cent. by the taxpayer, 11 per cent. by contributions, and 4 per cent. by charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised differently. I am told that 60 per cent. is borne by the taxpayer, 6 per cent. by charges and 12 per cent. by contributions, and a small proportion from the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just telling the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is taking the whole area of services, and it may be that we are speaking about slightly different things. Overwhelmingly, and on this I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, the service is financed by the Exchequer, and this brings disadvantages as well as benefits. In 1966 we spent 4.85 per cent. of the gross national product on the National Health Service. The percentage may have increased slightly, but that is roughly the position today. This is a smaller percentage than that in the United States or in many European countries which do not have a health service of the type that we have. So there are some things which we must examine.<br><br>
The consequence in Wales, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, is obsolete and obsolescent hospitals, and for this successive Governments must share responsibility. We find, too, inadequate provision for the elderly, the mentally ill and other special categories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Bradford South, is not a member of the Committee. Will he kindly withdraw?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Likewise there are dificiencies in the welfare services. We accept that new and extra burdens are emerg-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
ing from the ageing population and from new and expensive treatments which are increasing every year, and we do not expect miracles at once from the Secretary of State; it would be unreasonable to do so.<br><br>
One solution would be increased expenditure, and he referred to this. If we could spend more money in Wales on the National Health Service, this would be a solution, but even if economic conditions allowed this, it would not solve all the problems. There is an almost insatiable demand upon these services. What then can be done, apart from increasing expenditure? With respect, I suggest the following.<br><br>
First—and the right hon. Gentleman says that he is doing this—he should institute a careful, detailed appraisal of the functions of the services which have been transferred to his Department. As an Opposition we will be reasonably patient while this is in progress, so long as it is done with a due sense of urgency.<br><br>
I believe that a valuable contribution could be made in the sphere of local authority housing. A closer relationship must be achieved between housing allocations and personal and family needs. At present, because of the uneven and chaotic application of the subsidies many families are living in very poor conditions and should be rehoused. Many of us know of such people in all areas. Likewise, we know of families who have been rehoused but who appear to have much less valid reasons for that good fortune than others might have. This is not my recommendation; it is among the valuable recommendations of the Seebohm Report.<br><br>
Another possibility is the enlargement of the private sector providing insurance, for example, B.U.P.A., perhaps encouraged by taxation incentives. I see far less scope for this in Wales than in some parts of England, but even in parts of Wales there may be room for some extension of the private sector to relieve demands on the National Health Service. My next suggestion is the early implementation of some of the other main recommendations of the Seebohn Report. Some recommendations demand early implementation in Wales, even more so than in England. To give one instance, a much more generous provision of home helps would enable many elderly Welsh
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1469">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
people to remain in their own homes rather than having to go into the residential homes to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, at far greater cost to public funds, and sometimes less desirably. There are, of course, cases where residential homes will be the only remedy, but extra extenditure which local authorities should be enabled to make would help the elderly and in the long run achieve economy.<br><br>
There is a need in Wales for the creation of the new local authority social service departments advocated by See-bohm. Through this method we could hope to achieve greater flexibility and greater co-ordination between the various health and social services.<br><br>
In the thickly populated parts of Wales there needs to be a careful examination of the duties and functions of the departments of welfare and children's officers in the local authorities. These functions have been ably carried out under difficult conditions, and an examination of how assistance might be given in the carrying out of these functions would be helpful.<br><br>
I will turn briefly to the hospital services, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. As an official Opposition, we on this side do not quarrel with the concept of larger and fewer district general hospitals serving more extensive areas than in the past. We generally subscribe to that view. This derives from the plan of the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell). Since he promulgated that view in 1962 it has been upheld by the present Government.<br><br>
We must acknowledge the force of the argument that an effective and modern hospital service demands comprehensive district hospitals of the type referred to by the right hon. Gentleman, with a full complement of consultants, surgeons, physicians, and other qualified and experienced staff, but we note, with great anxiety, claims that there is little alternative to providing district general hospitals in the United Kingdom for units of population originally estimated at 150,000, more latterly at 200,000, and I have heard even 250,000 referred to by the medical profession. Such figures may be realistic in the Greater London area; they may be realistic in other thickly populated areas such as the Midlands; but they are quite unrealistic, outside one

or two conurbations around Cardiff and Swansea, in the rural parts of Wales, which comprise most of the geographical area. I do not speak for the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans), but for my hon. Friends and myself, who feel that a figure of 100,000 to 125,000 would be much more realistic in the geographical conditions of the Principality. Even that figure would involve people in the rural areas in considerable journeys, and one can imagine how difficult those journeys might be in wintry conditions when roads are closed by snow.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
In my constituency the Barry Accident Hospital, for example, serves not only the 43,000 people in the town of Barry but also the rapidly developing areas of Rhoose, Wenvoe, Dinas-Powis, Sully and Llantwit-Major, which are increasing in size and population. It also caters for those injured at the civil airport at Rhoose, the Royal Air Force station at St. Athan, the factory of Midland Silicones at Barry, Chemicals at Sully, the cement works at Rhoose and Aberthaw and the power stations at The Leys, near Rhoose. The directors, management and works council of B.P. Chemicals have expressed to me profound concern at the possibility of the closure of the hospital, which has also given admirable services in respect of many road accidents in this crowded part of south-east Glamorgan, where there are many dangerous roads and a rapid growth of industrial and other traffic. In addition, we have the holidaymakers at Butlins holiday camp, at caravan sites, and other places, in the summer months. Therefore, we should not be thinking in terms of the town of Barry alone but in terms of a great area of varied activity and the military and other services served by the hospital. On behalf of my constituents who live in and near Caerphilly, I support the pleas of the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Fred Evans) and the Caerphilly Council for the retention of the Caerphilly and District Miners' Hospital, which is a similar case. The annex of that hospital is in my constituency. Imagine the difficulty of ambulances going over the mountains.<br><br>
In general, I am not prepared to accept without question the official view that in accident and emergency cases the length of journey to the base hospital does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
imperil life. It is said that there is no medical opinion in favour of that argument, that there are no statistics to reinforce it. Of course there are no statistics, because we are dealing with a situation that has not yet arisen. It is feasible that if all serious surgical cases and dangerous accident and emergency cases had to be taken by ambulance, often during peak traffic hours, into hospitals in congested areas a different and rather more tragic position might emerge.<br><br>
I feel sure that the right hon. Gentleman, with his background and his humane outlook, will not entirely reject the very real consideration that if patients are to be kept in the district general hospitals for any length of time it would involve much greater time and expense for their relations—wives, husbands and children—to visit them. That is a human consideration that I am sure he will note.<br><br>
I want to end now, so I shall make only one comment about the Ely Hospital. This is a delicate matter, and I want to treat it as such. The Secretary of State for Social Services in his statement in the House following the publication of the Howe Report, said that hospitals like Ely Hospital must in future be given their fair share of manpower and money, even if this would mean a reallocation of resources within the National Health Service. It is too soon to ask the Government how the reallocation will take place, but do they intend to carry out this principle in Wales so that there will be a reallocation of resources into mental care? As the right hon. Gentleman said, it involves one-third of all the hospital beds in the Principality. That is a big number, and it is a very serious problem. Can the Minister of State say whether the principle ennunciated by her right hon. Friend in the House is to be carried out in Wales?<br><br>
There are other matters, such as a shortage of nurses. There was a serious shortage of nurses in Sully Hospital not long ago, which put that splendid hospital partly out of commission. This is not necessarily a matter of money. Nurses have a predeliction for the amenities of built-up areas and cities, rather than hospitals in the countryside. The difficulties are sometimes much more subtle than money problems.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman assumed responsibility for an enormous task, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
in tackling it he has our good wishes. In due course we shall naturally have to be critical if criticism is required, but we shall not be critical for criticism's sake. In many respects we regard this matter as being above the normal interplay of party politics. The right hon. Gentleman will enjoy from us in this sphere even greater co-operation than perhaps in some of the other responsibilities of his Department. In that spirit, I commend his first short period in office, and hope that he will now get down to the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harold Finch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a general welcome for the Government's decision that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales should now take over the health and welfare services in the Principality. Judging from his opening speech, we are very much encouraged by the new atmosphere which I am sure there will now be in Wales in connection with these very important services. I feel that greater attention will be given to some of the medical and social problems affecting our people, and that at least some of them will be dealt with very effectively by the new team at the Welsh Office.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend realises that he is taking over services which have already achieved much. The introduction of the National Health Service years ago opened the floodgates to free medical attention and hospital treatment, medical supervision and periodical examinations. People now have the advantage of a service that they could ill afford before the introduction of the N.H.S. I am convinced that people are living longer today, and that a great deal of suffering, hardship and misery has been alleviated as a result of this great service.<br><br>
But free medical care has placed a greater strain on the Health Service and although it has expended greatly much more must be done if it is to meet the demands of the public in general. There has been a great advancement in medical science. More operations are undertaken are there are better forms of treatment. All this is to the credit of the Health Service. In many hospitals gynaecological care has created a tremendous increase in work, to which must now be added abortions. The geriatric wards are full, and road casualties and other emergencies add to the work of doctors and nurses.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
One cannot speak too highly of the medical staff and nursing profession. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will use his influence to increase the status of the nursing staff. I become impatient when I hear the arguments about meals and the general status of nurses. As one who has been in hospital and has some experience of nursing, I cannot speak too highly of the medical and nursing staff in many of our hospitals. They deserve all the pressure my right hon. Friend can bring to bear on the powers that be to improve the status of the nurses in particular. I hope that he will leave no stone unturned to achieve that. We are short of nurses in hospitals, and perhaps the only satisfactory way to cope with the situation is to increase their status.<br><br>
In 1967, the total number of in-patients dealt with in hospitals in Wales was 288,449. During the same year there were 1,479,934 total attendance at out-patient departments, plus 695,073 accident and emergency cases. It is all to the credit of the Health Service in Wales that these were dealt with, but on the other side of the balance sheet the increased attendances and demands by the public have imposed a great strain on the health and social services, and the need for medical attention continues to grow very quickly.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee are disturbed at the waiting lists. Many people are still waiting to get into either outpatient or in-patient departments of hospitals. I think that the position has improved somewhat of late, but in 1968 there were 28,455 waiting to go into outpatient departments. That is a very big figure. In my constituency men who could be back at work are remaining idle while they await treatment for duodenal ulcers. There is no sign of their getting into the Royal Wenvoe, which is the nearest hospital to my part of the country. They pleaded with me for help. There are other people who seek private medical interviews, particularly the elderly, because they are in too much pain and cannot wait any longer. They use up what savings they have and then get prompt attention. Once one seeks private advice, it is amazing how quickly the service is given. This sort of thing can jeopardise the free medical service, and I hope that my right hon. Friend can take special measures to reduce the wait-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
ing lists at hospitals in Wales and Monmouthshire.<br><br>
There are not enough geriatric beds. When the condition of elderly patients improves they come under the welfare service. Many of these old ladies and gentlemen live alone and have not the necessary facilities, or their accommodation is such that it is deplorable that they should be sent home. In other cases they are living with people with large families, and so it is very difficult to send them home. The responsibility then falls on the welfare service, but there are not enough residential homes and many elderly people cannot go to such homes. Further help could be given in many respects. A great deal has been done in Monmouthshire. In Cwmbran the local authorities have had doors widened and ramps put in to assist the physically handicapped and elderly to get about at home. I hope that when my right hon. Friend will have an opportunity to visit some of the houses there and see the excellent work that has been done by the local authorities for such people. Much can be done in this respect.<br><br>
It seems crazy to me to talk about closing some of the local hospitals, which could be used for geriatric cases. It must be remembered that many local hospitals were built by the miners years ago. From their meagre wages they established hospitals at Tredegar, Ebbw Vale and Blackwood. They had their own medical service, which was the forerunner of the National Health scheme, and the hospitals stand as a living symbol of the great work of the miners years ago to have their own health service.<br><br>
Some of the local hospitals, small as they are, can be used for the elderly. There are local women with nursing experience anxious to give service under medical supervision in looking after the elderly in some of the local hospitals. This would relieve the strain on the bigger hospitals, because a large part of the waiting lists is made up by the elderly. I hope that my right hon. Friend will bear some of these points in mind.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Base hospitals have been referred to. There is no opposition to base hospitals, with their modern equipment. That is not the cause of the trouble in the valleys of Wales on the suggestion of closing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
hospitals. Our people believe in base hospitals, but they are often miles away from the centre of Monmouthshire. There is St. James's Hospital, and Caerphilly, which are nearer, but Abergavenny Hospital serves the north of Monmouthshire and is a long way to go for us in the heart of the county. If there were a base hospital within reasonable distance, that would be accepted without difficulty. For me, health services and social security have always been a first priority. Roads and education are very important, but these are secondary to health, which also affects production. How many days are lost through strikes? About 24 million days were lost in 1966-67 in Wales through sickness. That is far more than those lost through strikes and is a major loss of production. I hope that my right hon. Friend will see what he and his Welsh team can do to reduce those figures. He would not only help to remove the pain and suffering of many patients but would help the economy.<br><br>
Because of what happened at Ely Hospital, it has been said that more attention will be given to the mentally handicapped, to which I agree, but I hope that that will not result in undue economies on the treatment of the physically handicapped. Many people who come under Section 2 are not fit for anything like remunerative work and Remploy cannot take them all. In Monmouthshire, under the County Council scheme is a workshop for the handicapped. A lady there who was struck with polio as a young girl, and had never been at work before, told me, "It is heaven to me to come here and do a job." How rewarding that is. So it is with others. We cannot economise on the Health Service, whatever economies we have to make elsewhere. We want more capital expenditure, not less. In Monmouthshire, there is co-operation between the County Council and the Red Cross. The County Council has 20-seater buses with suitable accommodation and steps which can be lowered. It is a treat to see these organisations helping the physically handicapped to meet for a cup of tea and some social life. They look forward to this day out, when they meet one another. This should be done by more local authorities.<br><br>
I know that no final decisions have been taken on the Green Paper, but I want to issue a warning to my right hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
Friend. It is suggested that area boards are to be established, consisting of nominated people. This will be strenuously opposed. The boards should be elected. To remove the democratic right of our people would be a step backwards, and we must go forwards. Representatives should be elected by the will of the people for this work, since they are the ones who have to be represented on the boards. I wish the Department all the best for the future. This is a great and important job and I am sure the Welsh Office will have the co-operation of all hon. Members in the tasks which lie ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have sometimes spoken harshly of me because I criticise the Government—and I do, very often. For one thing, I want to stimulate them to more action in the allocation of jobs and the building of roads. But I have also sometimes spoken well of the Government. Perhaps that is not so well-known—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When does the hon. Member do it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Monday, I enthusiastically commended the rural electrification programme of the South Wales Electricity Board, a State board. Today, I pay a tribute to what has been accomplished by the Government on the hospital and health services. We have had a remarkably fine hospital building programme. I am happy that, among the major schemes completed during the year is the fourth phase of the Glangwili Hospital at Carmarthen, which now has 400 beds. I was a patient there a few years ago for a month for a quite serious operation and I shall always remember with gratitude the work of the surgeon and his staff and of the nursing and medical staff at that fine hospital. Many more buildings of this kind are needed.<br><br>
One example is that of Hensol, which is a different field, although still related to medicine. It is a hospital for mentally subnormal people—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, but I am doing it for his own sake. I am afraid that many hon. Members, particularly at the back of the Room, cannot hear him, and the Press, too, will be assisted if he will speak a little louder.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that they heard the first part of the hon. Member's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was speaking of the hospital at Hensol, which is a hospital for mentally subnormal people, and is grossly overcrowded. It serves not only Glamorganshire but Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. I am told that it is overcrowded by 55 per cent. What we need is a new unit, possibly at Carmarthen, for the mentally subnormal of the south-west. This is one way in which the programme of hospital building can and should be expanded.<br><br>
Since I am speaking of expansion and development in Carmarthenshire, I would add that we have had there the biggest of the homes for the elderly which have been completed in the last year, at Glan Morlais at Llandybie. We now have a handsome and comfortable home for the old people and we must all wish that this work could be expanded quickly. So many of the buildings for old people are not worthy of our society. The marvel is that those in charge can perform the service they do, and can contend so successfully with the forbidding environment which they often have, and make such cheerful and attractive rooms in these old buildings. I have great admiration for the splendid services rendered by these devoted people.<br><br>
The public are not often so interested in these homes for old people as they are in hospitals, but the closer the contact between hospitals and old people's homes and the public, the better. The greater the help and co-operation with them from the public in leagues of friends and so on the better, and the more public participation in their control, the better. As the Green Paper recognises, reorganisation is needed here, and the Welsh Hospital Board has, in Mr. Gwilym Prys Davies, a Chairman with the drive and energy to carry this through.<br><br>
The Green Paper recognised the need to integrate various health services at all levels, but what we need in Wales is a great measure of decentralisation of control so as to ensure the maximum participation consistent with efficiency. The suggestion of area health boards is a good one. Wherever possible, they should coincide with county or county borough authorities. I agree with the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) that at least a big part of the members of these boards
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
should be elected. However they are chosen, the remainder could be appointed by the Welsh Board of Health, which should be the only other tier. The area boards could assume the functions of the county health committees, local National Health executives, and hospital management committees. The ambulance services and the health centres should come under the control of the hospital authorities.<br><br>
This reference to ambulances brings to mind the great need, since there will be more and more centralisation of hospitals, for better roads so that ambulances can travel more speedily and easily.<br><br>
Probably the most controversial question of all is how far hospitals should be centralised. I am always strongly in favour of decentralisation, wherever possible, and it is possible in many aspects of the health services—for instance, maternity, geriatrics, pre-convalescence, and beds for observation, minor injuries and social cases. Local hospitals can be used as health centres and welfare homes for the aged and as long-stay hospitals. All these functions can best be performed by local hospitals, because, in many, the close proximity of relations and friends is decisive.<br><br>
But for acute cases, I must admit that the big hospital is a necessity. Among many reasons, I would instance five. The first is accommodation. Most of our hospitals will be obsolete by the end of the century, and a large and very costly programme of physical renewal is essential. Second, medical and nursing staff are hard to come by now. It is an extraordinary fact, which does not reflect well on us in Wales, that no less than 34 per cent. of hospital doctors in Wales now come from overseas. We obviously need more doctors, and this suggests a need for at least one more teaching hospital. I hope that it will be at Swansea, and before long—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate, of course, that some people trained in the Welsh School of Medicine do not necessarily remain in Wales to take posts; they go all over the world, and to other parts of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. Unfortunately, the Welsh School of Medicine is becoming more and more Anglicised; that is one of the reasons for this—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member was doing very well up to now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the least English unit in the Welsh University, and I was very glad of it for that reason.<br><br>
Teaching hospitals, however, should not be given more resources than other hospitals.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The third reason why we must have these large hospitals concerns equipment. Very expensive equipment is increasingly used, and the smaller general hospitals cannot afford it.<br><br>
Fourthly, treatment. To give the best treatment, specialist diagnostic and therapeutic teams are necessary. Fifthly—and this is, perhaps, a strange reason—accidents and emergencies. It is now thought that first-class facilities and treatment are even more important than immediate treatment. In the big hospitals consultants are available right round the clock. They are not available in the smaller hospitals, so the advantage of proximity is there lost.<br><br>
For these reasons, centralisation seems to be necessary for acute hospitals, but the present uncertainty must be removed, because it is leading to numbers of our staff leaving. They feel insecure. They do not know what the future holds. Therefore, plans for the future should quickly be published so that they know where they stand.<br><br>
One last point on hospitals, as the Secretary of State now has great responsibility in this sphere. I should like to draw to his attention what seems to be an unsatisfactory position in the matter of appointments. The Group Secretary of the South-West Wales Hospital Group is now retiring. One would expect his successor to be appointed in Wales, but it seems that the appointment is to be made in London. This seems an anomaly, which, perhaps, the Secretary of State will look into.<br><br>
In the matter of health and hospital services, we see development and improvement and the prospect of more. I should have liked to have discussed welfare services, but time does not permit. Here, alas, there is no development and improvement. Quite the contrary. We have recently had a series of cutbacks: prescription charges; higher charges for school meals, and now teeth and spec-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
tacles; the ending of benefits for the first three days of sickness, injury or unemployment; and possibly, worst of all, the ending of milk for secondary school pupils. No doubt there is worse still to come.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the first three days of benefits for sickness, injury or unemployment have been done away with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been grossly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. it has not. I think that the hon. Gentleman is mistaken—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member is giving way, will he resume his seat?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to correct a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had this series of cutbacks in the social services. The right hon. Gentleman said that this was inevitable. He said that the reasons were financial. Of course they are financial. But he also suggested that there was no alternative but to raise taxes. This is not true. There is an alternative. There are possible ways of financing the system apart from those we now have. For instance, the method of what is called negative or reverse Income Tax deserves close study.<br><br>
But this is a matter of priorities. Is Britain to be a power State or a welfare State? That is the choice before us. As long as it tries to play the part of a big Power at a cost of well over £2,000 million a year, the Welfare State will have to be dismantled, but if it were to cut its military costs to half there would be ample margin to create work for those who would lose it to build roads and also to maintain the Welfare State. I am sure that when we get our Welsh State it will be a welfare State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last time I followed the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) in this Committee I had to criticise some of the remarks which he made. I am gratified today that I am able to compliment him on the extremely constructive tenor of his approach.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to people who have criticised him for being critical.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
I believe that I fall into that category. In fact the hon. Gentleman referred to this recently in a letter to the <i>Western Mail,</i> but he will understand our feelings when he remembers that, in that letter, he mentioned it was not his rôle to praise; indeed, that he had come to bury the Government. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bear in mind that if he buried the Government he would also bury the Government's policies, particularly in Wales. I am surprised that he could countenance the Tory alternative which would follow the burial of this Government. But today he has been kind and constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have come here to bury the Government as an English Government, Labour or Tory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not call me English.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carmarthen will realise that the burial of one Government, as things are now, would mean the setting up of the alternative, which would be a Tory Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mrs. Eirene White)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The starting point today should be the implications of the transference of responsibility for the health services on 1st April to the Welsh Office.<br><br>
I pose this question: was it a token gesture of transference or will it prove to have been a meaningful step in the deconcentration of power, giving real scope for the evolution in Wales of the pattern of health services relevant to our needs?<br><br>
There has been one immediate benefit. There is now contact between Ministers, administrators in the health services, the hospitals and the local authorities which provide the services. One had the feeling that the old Welsh Board of Health suffered somewhat from lack of stimulus due to its remoteness from the Ministry. At least everything is much closer now. This is a good thing, but this proximity is hardly enough to give real meaning to the transference of responsibility.<br><br>
The great problem of the health services in this country is the tripartite division of administration. The hospital services, the executive councils responsi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
ble for G.P.s and the local authority controlled health and welfare services have all tended to go their own ways without sufficient co-operation.<br><br>
We have heard of cases of doctors unwilling to participate in the running of local hospitals. We have seen the failure in some cases of local authorities to provide services for the handicapped in some areas. This has meant that people who could have used these services have been left in mental hospitals. I think that about 80 could be discharged from Ely, who, given alternative provision outside the mental hospital, need not have been there at all. We have curious anomalies, like the factor that in planning new hospitals we do not have the same authority responsible for the planning responsible for such an essential ancillary activity as the ambulance service. We are suffering from this threefold division.<br><br>
The case for co-ordination has been impeccably given in the Green Paper: the need for unification of the health services. This is almost universally accepted. The criticism of the Green Paper is the authoritarian nature of the boards, a point which has already been raised. To be valuable, in terms of communication with the public, they need to be elected and, just as important, there should be a proper level for a second tier of administration of a unified service somewhat lower down than area boards. In England this is in the melting pot. We do not know what will happen there. In some parts of England there has been better voluntary co-ordination than in Wales. One problem in the past in Wales was that many people felt that the Welsh Board of Health was doing the coordinating and perhaps did not feel this was its full responsibility, with the result that not much co-ordination took place between the three sections of the Service.<br><br>
I contend that in Wales we have a Hospital Board which would be more willing than most to go for unification and co-ordination of this kind. I ask the Minister: will the Welsh Office act positively here? Are we to wait for a pattern to emerge in England in a further Green Paper followed by a White Paper, or will we take some action ourselves?<br><br>
We have missed the boat once on one thing, namely, an elected council for Wales. It was not due to lack of effort on the part of the then Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1476">Image</span>

State. The Government did not move on what we will see shortly as the recommendation of the Maud Commission, the implications of which for Wales will almost certainly be an elected council for Wales. We could have got in first. I hope that we can move first in the field of health. Concerning the administration of a unified health service in Wales, what could be better than an elected council? One of its committees could co-ordinate, with representatives of the health services among its co-opted members. The present functions of the Welsh Office give a good starting point for an elected council for Wales. But if we are not prepared to say that we will go ahead and will coordinate in Wales before the English are led to co-ordinate in England, I fall back on my second question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point, he will appreciate that there are difficulties with an elected council for Wales. The powers which it would assume would have to be taken either from the Secretary of State or from the new large local authorities that we are contemplating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or from the central Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would then have not only the Secretary of State, but also the new Welsh counties and an elected council—and Wales would be top heavy with Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we will not stray too far into the question of an elected council, local government services, and so on. I appreciate that these are intertwined, but let us confine ourselves to the subject matter of this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will leave that argument. Certainly there are difficulties, as the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) points out, but they should not frighten us. They can be overcome.<br><br>
I come to my second question: how about the hospital services as such in Wales?<br><br>
In Wales and in England we have been following guide-lines laid down in 1962 by the then Conservative Minister of Health, the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South - West (Mr. Powell). The same basic thinking was continued in this Government's building
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
programme laid down in the 1966 White Paper. Since then we have pursued a policy of concentrating our hospitals and medical manpower resources into district general hospitals. I contend that if this policy is carried through to its conclusion without compromise it will have a devastating effect on the provision of hospital services in rural areas in Wales. I do not dispute that there is a need for large hospitals. There are certain levels of medical treatment which can only be obtained in large hospitals which have the resources and the variety of specialties. But a hospital should serve a community. In concentrated urban areas a large hospital can do this. In rural areas, where there are great difficulties of communication, we need something to supplement the scattered pattern of large district hospitals.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Let us take the situation in north Wales. I do not want to go into this in detail; I merely mention it. Wrexham, Bodelwyddan and Bangor are scheduled for large units, but they are so far apart as to make it essential that medium-sized hospitals should be preserved, and perhaps even some small hospitals at certain points. Let us take Llandudno as an example, which was scheduled eventually to be converted to a geriatric unit. It is an excellent hospital which is a long way from Bangor in terms of travel time. The police and ambulance services tell me that in present road conditions it can take one and a half hours to get to Bangor from Llandudno during summer months. In times of exceptional traffic pressure and road congestion, it can take as long as two and a half hours. In the lower Conway Valley we have a population of 70,000 people. The population is rapidly increasing, and nearly trebles during the summer months when highly accident-prone tourists and holiday makers come into the area.<br><br>
I feel strongly that it is not only the provision of medical services within reach of a community which must be considered, but the fact that a hospital is part of the community and the community must have an influence upon it. The activities of the League of Friends in Llandudno, although in part emotive, must be taken into account. There are social as well as medical considerations,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
and I was glad that the Secretary of State mentioned them.<br><br>
An important aspect of regional policy is that of employment. A hospital like Adelina Patti Hospital in south Wales probably has no very good medical reasons to keep it going, but there are certainly excellent social reasons for it to continue in terms of employment. People seem to think that regional policy consists of only matters like Board of Trade grants for industry, or grants for certain railways, but similar assistance could be given in regard to a hospital for which there is a social need.<br><br>
Like the Management Committee of the Caernarvon and Anglesey area, I feel that Llandudno should be preserved as a general hospital serving as a supporting unit to the new hospital at Bodelwyddan and Bangor. We know that the Welsh Hospital Board is planning to provide a small district hospital at Withybush, Haverfordwest, to support the larger district general hospital at Carmarthen. I am not sure that responsibility for such provision should be thrown on to the Welsh Hospital Board.<br><br>
A decision has to be taken, and basically it is a political matter. The guidelines which we are now following are the Tory guidelines of 1962, guidelines which were aimed at a large concentrated unit. If the Welsh Hospital Board could be given proper latitude to make its decisions on medium-sized hospitals, decisions must be made at Government level. I feel strongly that we need a Green Paper or a White Paper from the Welsh Office setting out the guidelines on the general question of the Health Service in Wales.<br><br>
Let me touch on the matter of the teaching hospital in Cardiff. One hears that the beds there may go up to 1,500. But a hospital should serve a community and, if it is to rise up to 1,500 beds, that is way above the size of the needs of the community, and it then becomes a community serving a teaching hospital. I think that it has become clear that in a teaching hospital it is not essential to have all the beds in the same hospital. Areas like Caerphilly could be part of the bed provision for a large teaching hospital so that it could serve a whole area in a thorough manner.<br><br>
There is one small point which is also more of a political matter. We have in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Wales been working on the same norms as to provision of beds and medical staff and so on as the rest of Britain. The average probably makes some sort of sense in Britain as a whole, but when one takes west Wales, mid Wales, and north Wales the norms do not make sense. This is not the responsibility of the Welsh Hospital Board but of the Welsh Office. It is a matter which should be decided here. Take as an example the C. and A. in Bangor. Four hon. Members recently met the C. and A. Management Group Committee, and we intend to meet them again in the Whitsun Recess. We have seen the problems there—the clear need to reorganise the provision of acute beds in the area, and the need to review and increase the medical and nursing staff in the main hospitals.<br><br>
The basic problem is one of finance. We in north Wales are distressed that, while work is progressing in south Wales, the starting date for the new hospital in Bangor is as far ahead as 1975. I hope that the Minister will say something about the whole question of allocation of resources. It will not suffice to say that allocation of resources is entirely the responsibility of the Welsh Hospital Board itself. The problem involves the need for a faster through-put in hospitals, the shortening of waiting lists of outpatients, the problem of provision for long-term geriatric and mental cases, the need for better research facilities for the collection and analysis of data. The financial problem is basic and does not turn on internal redistribution and allocation of finance by the Welsh Hospital Board.<br><br>
In his statement on Ely on 27th March, the Secretary of State for Social Services said, speaking of hospitals with special problems:
<br><blockquote><p>"These hospitals must be given their fair share of manpower and money, even if it meant, as it will mean, a reallocation of resources within the Health Service."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th March, 1969; Vol. 780, c. 1810.]</p></blockquote>
Not within the hospital services, but within the Health Service. That is one matter of reallocation which is not something for the Welsh Hospital Board itself. It is a matter to be decided on a political level.<br><br>
What are our priorities in Wales to be? We have responsibilities for health services, for roads, for housing and for many other things. Are we happy, not so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
much about the question of distribution within the Welsh Hospital Board, but as to whether our whole priorities on allocation between various fields is correct? I hope that the Minister in reply will deal with the following three questions. Are we going towards a unified service? If not, are we to bring the whole concept of the hospital service in Wales up to date and break it of its 1962 origins? Are we happy about the allocation of finances to health in Wales?<br><br>
The Secretary of State has done a great deal. He has been visiting hospitals and there is a good communication. This is most important, and I thank him for it. But I hope also that there will be some hard thinking, and indeed rethinking, about the health services. I hope that we shall be assured that this process is taking place, otherwise the transference to the Welsh Office of responsibility for the health services will have been no more than window dressing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Desmond Donnelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies). It is no disrespect to other hon. Members to say that his was one of the best-informed I have ever heard in this Room, and it was a great pleasure to hear it.<br><br>
There is a sense of unreality about this debate today. Only one speaker has mentioned in any depth the nature of the economic climate against which the social services are now having to operate. The truth is, as <i>The Times</i> says in a leading article, that we are in the worst economic crisis since 1931 and probably with the weakest Government since 1931. This must pose great problems for anybody who tries to get money for social services. The hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) spoke about priorities as between social services and defence. The problem in relation to the social services bill in the United Kingdom as a whole is that overall it is too large because the benefits which are being provided are too indiscriminate and right across the board.<br><br>
The truth is that, after four years or so of Labour Government, we are still in a situation in which the pockets of poverty are as great as they ever were. We are not meeting the problem, and we must have a new approach to the whole principles of the Welfare State as they exist at present. We want much more than a Welfare State: we want a state of welfare. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
real requirement is that the needy are helped. Those who can afford to pay should be asked to pay and should expect to pay. There is no way round it, if we are to get enough money for social services and to get a better standard of social services.<br><br>
The Health Service is a classic example. We need a great deal more money for the National Health Service. At the moment it runs on two unfortunate premises. First, on the exploitation of the people who are working in the Service, from the consultant down to the nurse. The hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) spoke about better status for nurses. He is quite right, but it is money that makes the difference. There is no substitute for money to give them the status. Where is that money to come from? The same is true of all the capital investments in the Health Service. We now have a Chairman of the Hospital Board who is as good, diligent and sympathetic and understanding as any chairman we have ever had, but he is as good as or as bad as the money he can get.<br><br>
The second thing that is wrong with the National Health Service is not only that it is running on exploitation of people, but that it is providing a second-class service. Mention has been made of waiting lists. How are they to be cut except by more money and better facilities, more consultants? It all means more money. There is no way round it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conway spoke about the various hospitals and the delay in building one hospital in his constituency. We had a similar problem in Pembrokeshire where there has been a number of mistakes in priorities. There was the building of the Glanwili Hospital which was sited in the wrong place in Carmarthenshire where it should never have been. It is not as if it could suddenly be turned into a new Income Tax office.<br><br>
We need more money for the building of hospitals but where are we to get it? I should like to make three suggestions. The hon. Member for Conway spoke about the future prospect of putting the Health Service under an elected regional council for Wales. I agree mat that is the way the trend should go, away from centralisation to more democratic control locally. I look upon the Secretary of State as a temporary institution. Eventually I hope that he will be transplanted by some chief Minister for Wales. The regional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
council will be effective only if it has financial powers. It will only be able to provide a good health service if it has powers if necessary to raise its own money. This is part of the essential underpinning of any elected regional government.<br><br>
The second thing to do is to look wider than the principle of a free Health Service. We cannot provide a free Health Service in this country without a lot more taxation. Professor Miller of Hull University estimated that we need £500 million a year if we are to give medicine the same priority in this country as it has in the United States, where there is no national health service.<br><br>
In my opinion Professor Miller put the figure too low. It is probably nearer £800 or £900 million. Translated <i>pro rata</i> in terms of population, this means that we need in Wales alone somewhere between £25 and £40 million.<br><br>
Where is it to come from? It cannot come from general taxation at its present level. The Secretary of State has told us how much of the present Health Service is being financed out of present taxation. We must recognise that, if we want more money, people must pay more. If we observe the principle of each according to his ability, to each according to his need, then people who can afford to pay must be expected to pay for the services which they receive. This is the only way we shall get more money.<br><br>
On the matter of drugs, hon. Members will remember all the schemozzle last year about the 2s. 6d. prescription charge. It was a lot of nonsense. The average cost of prescription in the National Health Service runs at near 13s. a week, whereas we are only paying 2s. 6d. Why should not people who can afford it pay the first 7s. 6d.? This would bring in a sizeable figure in terms of the United Kingdom of £50 or £60 million a year.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
In regard to the visiting of doctors, the average number of consultations in visits to a doctor per year per person is about 3.5. Excluding the 10 million young and the 10 million old, why should not the 30 million in middle life be expected to pay 5s. each time they go to the doctor if they can afford to? It might cut down the burden on the general prac-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
tioner and, at the same time, bring in a lot of money.<br><br>
Thirdly, there is the question of hospital beds. The average cost of a hospital bed in the National Health Service is about £60 a week. The hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) spoke about insurance schemes. Is there any reason why people who can afford to contribute to insurance schemes should not do so? We pay one way or another; we pay either in a reduced wage packet or through another system: this is the only way in which we can get money to raise the standard of the National Health Service. Those who could afford to do so could be asked to pay the first £20 towards a hospital bed. I do not advocate a separate service. We have a separate service at present. One can take a taxi to Harley Street and buy medical attention. I am against that system in principle. I want to raise everyone up so that that system becomes redundant. That system may be all right for a Tory Government but it ill becomes a Labour Government to condone it. A person asked to pay the first £20 towards the hospital bed could be insured against that £20 for Is. 6d. per week. That amount would not break anybody in this day of rising wages, but it would make a great deal of difference to the money which is available to raise the general standard of the hospital services.<br><br>
If there were more local initiative much more could be done to raise money locally to supplement the State contribution towards the building of hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flag Days?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donnelly</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flag days, yes; I am not against flag days. In Haverfordwest we built a swimming pool out of money raised locally. The country hospital in Haverfordwest was paid for by public contributions and not by the National Health Service. If we can raise money to enlarge and improve the new hospital contemplated at Withybush, why should not we do so? Let us take the State contribution and add to it. In that way we shall get a better service. Otherwise, we are stuck in this old fashioned slit trench.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) objects to this attitude, but this is the difference of opinion between us. It involves a means
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
test, but not the kind of means test that was the indignity of the 1930s. There is a means test involved in the Income Tax for this purpose, and the people who of the social services operate under means tests. The Income Tax system can be used fort his purpose, and the people who provide the service need never know who pays and who does not.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton) when he was overlord of the social services, before he was sacked for thinking up such ideas, worked it all out in great detail, and it is available in the Government files. Hon. Gentlemen may think that this would mean that ordinary workpeople would surfer, but this is not so. I am trying to raise the standards, and my proposals must stand or fall by that criterion.<br><br>
We sometimes get a wrong idea about taxation. Do not think that only the rich pay taxes. Everybody pays taxes. The average break even point of what is received in welfare benefits and what is contributed in taxes is surprisingly and alarmingly low, in view of the present level of Government expenditure. The average wage in the United Kingdom is £23 a week; it is much less in Wales. A man earning £15 a week with a wife and one child will pay more in taxes than he receives in welfare benefits. Tax is paid when cigarettes or a pint of beer are bought, one names it, one pays a tax on it. The only way to obtain more money is to provide new avenues for attracting it.<br><br>
We need a much better Health Service in Wales, and this can come only with a completely new approach.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Donnelly) will forgive me if I do not follow him since, if I did so, I would make no contribution of my own but merely have a debate with him.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend, in taking over responsibility for hospital and welfare services in Wales, is not taking over at an easy time. There are many headaches in front of him. The Ely Hospital Report has been mentioned, the reorganisation of the health services in Wales, file Green Paper, and a host of items, all of which will present my right hon. Friend and his colleagues with considerable problems in the days that lie ahead. I wish him well in his new duties. We have seen the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
enthusiasm and energy with which my right hon. Friend and his colleagues have started on their job by the numerous visits which they have made to hospitals throughout Wales.<br><br>
I do not want to say much about the Ely Hospital Report. Before anyone is tempted to become too vociferous in his criticisms of such hospitals he should visit them. If people were to do so they would come away full of praise and understanding for the difficult and great work carried out by these hospitals and by doctors, nurses and other staff who are often working in impossible conditions. That is how I felt when I spent almost a day at Hensol Castle Hospital. I spoke there to the staff and to a few patients. I also spent some time talking to the families of patients who were visiting on that day. The families were full of praise for the patience, skill and understanding of the staff.<br><br>
On that day I was pleased to see the new assessment unit and treatment centre, which has been completed at a cost of £107,000. Nevertheless, despite the patience and skill of the staff and in spite of the new unit, there were many shortages at that hospital. The hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) referred to overcrowding at Hensol, and with this I concur. I saw wards in which the beds were so close together that it was impossible to put a fist between them. I saw old blocks where every evening the staff had to carry 15 or more adult patients upstairs to bed. There were many defects.<br><br>
This illustrates our failure to provide adequate resources for such hospitals, for which we all bear responsibility—Government, Members of Parliament, hospitals boards, management committees, and the general public. In dealing with hospitals for the mentally ill we, as the general public and as public representatives, have hidden our heads in the sand and pretended that these problems did not exist. We have hoped that a miracle would turn up to solve them, without the necessity for us to be troubled too deeply.<br><br>
To provide the improvements needed for long-stay hospitals for the mentally sick and subnormal, we should first look at savings outside the National Health Service. To put it mildly, I was disappointed when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
suggested that this was not likely to happen. I still look with longing eyes at the size of our Defence budget, and I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, to tell the Secretary of State for Social Services that he should first look in the direction of Defence expenditure before raising the charges for spectacles and false teeth.<br><br>
At the end of the day, if we have to alter our priorities inside the National Health Service—and I hope that we shall all fight to get the money from outside—we have a duty to ensure a far greater priority for the mentally sick and subnormal. I share the view of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State who said words to the effect that his group more than any other group depends upon us. These people have no voice and no vote. If they had had a vote it is probable that we would in the past have paid a great deal more attention to them. They have a long lasting and sometimes permanent need for our compassion and consideration.<br><br>
I turn to one item of welfare, not a tremendous item, but a serious human problem, which is mentioned at page 16 of Cmnd. 1930, Wales, 1968:
<br><blockquote><p>"The possibility of providing a Work Preparation Course at the Port Talbot I.R.U. for school-leavers of low educational attainment is being considered with the education authorities of Glamorgan and Swansea."</p></blockquote>
This is a welfare problem which needs consideration and action. I have recently heard in my constituency of several young boys of low educational attainment who are finding it impossible to start work. These youngsters are a special responsibility of ours. How can we expect these young lads and young girls to grow up with a sense of responsibility, with feelings that they are needed and that they have a part to play in society, if we deny them from the start the right to work? Private industry and public authorities have a part to play here. They should be asked to employ school-leavers of low educational attainment. Will my right hon. Friend look at this aspect and consider whether he could approach public authorities and private firms? Will he also look at the other side and consider some form of grant? We give grants for the training of skilled people who are usually average or above average intelligence. Why cannot we give assistance to those of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
low educational attainment? If we do not find them work, then they will draw social security benefits. It seems reasonable that we should consider offering firms part of the social security benefit which these youngsters now receive for doing nothing. Unless we do something about it, we are condemning these youngsters to live almost without hope, and to become a constant source of worry to their families and an ever increasing burden on society.<br><br>
I am sure my right hon. Friend will be relieved to know that I do not propose to discuss the Llwynypia Hospital—not that my hon. Friend for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) and I are perfectly satisfied—but on this first debate in the Welsh Committee on the hospital and health services it is better to look at general principles.<br><br>
During the last year proposals involving hospital closures and the change of use of hospitals have become public issues in many areas—including Rhondda. One constant theme runs through all these issues, the genuine and deep feeling of ordinary people that no one is concerned to listen to their point of view, that no one cares sufficiently about them to explain proposals for hospital closures which directly affect their lives. Hospitals are for people; they are not for doctors, nurses, management committees, hospital boards or Ministers of Health. The relationship between the hospital and the people it serves is very close and sensitive. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) reminded us of this. This close relationship is particularly relevant in South Wales where, as he said, so many of our hospitals were built out of the weekly contributions of miners and other workers.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Section 70 of the National Health Act, 1946 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister may cause an enquiry to be held in any case where he deems it advisable to do so in connection with any matter arising under this Act."</p></blockquote>
Yet I understand that since 1946, for the whole 23 years, on no occasion has any Minister held such an inquiry before deciding on the closure or change of use of any hospital. The holding of a public inquiry might serve a very useful purpose both by enabling the population affected by the decision to demonstrate their concern and by enabling the hos-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
pital authorities to publish their arguments in favour of the closure, and these arguments and proposals should be aired at a meeting in the area most affected by the decision as well as during discussions in London or Cardiff. I ask my right hon. Friend to hold discussions with the Welsh Hospital Board, whose Chairman, I believe, is sympathetic to this point of view, and see whether a system can be devised to ensure that the views of the general public are taken into account before irrevocable decisions are made.<br><br>
There are two items with which I am concerned. First, I urge my right hon. Friend to ensure that we have more and better provision for mental and subnormal hospitals. Second, I ask him, in the whole of the hospital reorganisation, to remember that the hospitals are people, and that the people have the right to be considered and heard before proposals are finalised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Few would dispute that today south-east Wales is a thriving area, and that from both an industrial and commercial standpoint it has a very bright future. There has been a steady build-up of population in the area for some time, but what has not really kept pace with these exciting developments is a corresponding expansion of the social services. Of these, one of the basic needs is adequate hospital provision. I say this at a time when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has taken over responsibility for these matters. He has spoken eloquently about them this morning.<br><br>
It is in this context of a thriving industrial community with a large build up of population that I want to urge the early and major development of the Royal Gwent Hospital at Newport. This splendid hospital, with a wonderful record of service over many years, is now bursting at the seams. I am not being parochial when I say that, because it is essentially a base hospital catering for nearly 400,000 people—bordering on half a million.<br><br>
We have heard in today's debate contributions about social needs, and that is the very subject to which I am referring. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) said how hospitals must serve people, and that is the very thing that I am advocating as well. The industrial and com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
mercial success of an era brings attendant problems. For example, there is the question of the pressure of life, which has become a national problem and is making demands on our hospital services throughout the country. However, this pressure is greater in busy industrial areas, and all the developments in east Monmouthshire have led to a stage where the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board could tell me, in a letter dated 30th February, that the Royal Gwent Hospital has the longest waiting list in Wales. I hope that the fact that I am the last back-bench speaker in the debate is not an indication of the priority given to this serious situation.<br><br>
The waiting list is of such great proportions that it naturally causes anxiety to those immediately affected and their near relatives. This anxiety in the area is reflected in my postbag and in the correspondence columns of the local newspaper. The list is particularly heavy in regard to surgery, ear nose and throat, and gynaecology, but there is also a considerable list in respect of paediatrics and ophthalmology. These are major problems at the Royal Gwent.<br><br>
One might say that the hospital is a major industry in the area, because it provides work for a thousand people in a full- and part-time capacity. A very large number of people go to the hospital each day, and as Mr. Rhys Edwards, the then Chairman of the Hospital Group, was quoted as saying on 4th February:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of them come to the accident and emergency departments, and they are rather apt to complain. But when you see the accommodation we have, and realise the number of people we put through, I do not know how the staff cope."</p></blockquote>
The population served by the hospital has increased by no less than 108,000 since 1948, and the number of patients has increased correspondingly. The consultant staff has also increased, but not by enough, and they also have to provide a service for north Monmouthshire.<br><br>
Much of the work at the hospital has to be carried out in an out-patients' department built in 1924. It is estimated that the number of patients at the hospital is likely to increase by at least 5 per cent. a year up to 1976, when the next major phase of development will be completed. These numbers cannot be ignored. Already the work rate of the medical staff is more than 50 per cent. up on the

average for hospitals in Wales, and even this wonderful effort is still outstripped by the number of patients. The situation obviously requires radical attention.<br><br>
We need to ask ourselves what can be done. Mr. Gwilym Prys Davies, the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board, has inherited a very difficult task. He has spoken of clinical teams to assist the consultants at the Royal Gwent, and has advocated other temporary measures. But it would not be unkind of me to say that these are merely paliatives and that something more fundamental is required.<br><br>
There is the question of temporary accommodation. This may be a part answer, and I put forward the urgent needs for temporary accommodation to extend the out-patients' department and orthopaedic department. In addition, 20 more E.N.T. beds are urgently needed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) mentioned the Abortion Act, which naturally very much affects the hospital service. In this respect, there is an urgent need at the Royal Gwent for a completion of the gynaecological theatre. I understand that the shell of another building is there at present, but that the inside is awaiting completion. These are emergency needs, and I hope that the proposals I have put forward will be treated in a spirit of emergency.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the long-term position of hospital development and the question of major developments of the hospital service in Monmouthshire. We need to ask ourselves where the money should be spent. I am not advocating the closure of smaller hospitals, because I tend to agree with the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) that much of the hospital service can be diversified, at least in certain respects. The question of a third large hospital in Monmouthshire has been mooted, but it appears that a body of expert and lay opinion was against this proposal. As my right hon. Friend said this morning, with the development of medical science specialisation increases. There would be a duplication of expensive equipment and the cost would be likely to be greater than for expanding existing facilities. Modern medicine and surgery need large-scale amenities and expensive equipment. In the long run, it is better for patients to have the best treatment, even if this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
means travelling 20 miles from their homes. Therefore, whatever decision is reached, I hope that it will not be on a parochial basis. We are all pleased with the recent development of Nevill Hall at Abergavenny, which will improve the position in north Monmouthshire.<br><br>
I return to my original analysis of the situation. The trends in industry and the movement of population make it apparent that major hospital development must be in line with those trends. The logical conclusion is that the next major stage of hospital development should be at the Royal Gwent Hospital, and by that development I mean the provision of additional beds. I am not being parochial, because my analysis is based on the harsh economic facts. Yet the existing plans, which were confirmed yesterday by my hon. Friend the Minister of State as a result of my Parliamentary Question, indicate that the stage three of this development at the hospital will not begin till 1973, and the first new beds will not be available till 1976. In addition, there is the question of commissioning—the furniture, fittings and so on—which could well take a further six to nine months. This is just not good enough, and I ask my hon. Friend to review the whole position of hospital development in Monmouthshire in order that the real priorities can be ascertained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This debate has taken place at a very opportune time, since only seven weeks have passed since the Secretary of State took over responsibility in Wales for health and welfare services, some aspects of agriculture, and, rather incongruously, ancient monuments. I regard that as a major step forward, and I echo the words of the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies), who hoped that it is a meaningful step and not mere window dressing. I extend my congratulations and good wishes to the right hon. Gentleman. I am only sorry that the Prime Minister took so long to transfer these functions to the Welsh Office, but that is the fault of the Prime Minister and not of the right hon. Gentleman or any of his colleagues in the Welsh Office.<br><br>
A debate on this subject was rather overdue, because the last took place almost five years ago to the day, on 13th May, 1964, before the present Government came to office. It seems even longer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
ago than five years. The debate has been very constructive, as most debates in this Committee are, and remarkably free from any party acrimony.<br><br>
Inevitably, a great deal of time has been taken up with references to threatened closures of local hospitals. That is as it should be. A protest war about these closures is raging throughout Wales at the moment. I shall say more about this later if I have time.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) made it clear that it would be inconsistent for any Conservative Member to object to the general principle of comprehensive district general hospitals. This was embodied in the hospital plan of 1962, which was approved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), who was then Minister of Health. It would also be inconsistent of right hon. and hon. Members opposite to object, because this principle has been endorsed several times by the present Government. Most thinking people wall agree that facilities for treating the acutely ill should fee concentrated in major centres. It is only there that the necessary range of diagnostic and treatment facilities can be provided. As the Secretary of State said, increases in medical knowledge lead to specialisation and this means that acute centres of this kind must be built if the Welsh people are to enjoy the best possible care.<br><br>
Part of the 1962 plan related to Wales and made it clear, first, that many existing Welsh hospitals were too small to provide the range of necessary facilities and that many were housed in buildings which have outlived their useful life. Most of our present hospital buildings are outdated. Many are over fifty years' old and are, therefore, inadequate for present-day demands. Few would lend themselves to adaptations, and few have space in their present grounds for any worthwhile expansion. We must also remember the difficulty of obtaining adequate numbers of doctors to serve in these smaller hospitals. One disadvantage is that they have little opportunity to work with experienced consultants and considerable difficulty in obtaining either wide or extensive experience on the one hand or specialist knowledge of any one subject on the other.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
Overshadowing everything else, we must remember the gloomy prediction of the Todd Commission, which reported in April, 1968, and which foresaw that, in present conditions, there would be a shortage of doctors in Britain as a whole of no fewer than 11,000 by 1975. I was glad to hear what the right hon. Gentleman said about the Welsh figure. It is not very exciting, but it is at least static, although the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) disclosed the startling fact that as high a proportion as a third of Welsh doctors come from outside Wales.<br><br>
One must be driven to the conclusion that the present situation falls short of providing an efficient modern hospital service serving the whole community, and that the general principle of the 1962 plan was right. However, we have had many years now to consider and digest it and we should take account of those criticisms of it that emerged in the meantime. There is a grave danger that, in pressing ahead with our capital development programme—this goes for both the Conservative and Labour Administrations—we have failed to examine in sufficient depth the social implications of our policy. I am glad to hear that the right hon. Gentleman's own disposition is against over-large hospitals.<br><br>
Of course, the general policy laid down in the 1962 plan was to create these large hospitals, where the majority of specialities could be concentrated, at centres of population and on lines of communication in such a way that no patient had to travel more than 25 miles for treatment.<br><br>
It was stressed by the plan, and by experts who have expressed their views since, that present research has shown that about 800 occupied beds are the minimum required to keep such a hospital busy, with full utilisation of staff and equipment. The argument is that a population of at least 150,000, and preferably 200,000, in any "catchment area" is necessary to produce 800 regularly occupied beds. Despite the fact that a smaller population would possibly mean under-utilisation of staff and equipment or the provision of a narrower range of facilities, one is bound to ask whether a catchment area of this size is realistic and reasonable for the greater part of Wales, which is rural and sparsely populated, and where communications are notori-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
ously difficult. The hon. Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) in a very able speech in the Welsh Day debate, referred to difficulties of communication even in industrial Glamorgan. How much worse is it in certain areas of north and west Wales? If this principle were rigidly followed, it would make nonsense of the 25-mile limit in rural Wales.<br><br>
One may ask also whether the ambulance service is sufficient to cope with the problem of carrying acute and emergency cases this extra distance. Nor can one dismiss lightly the possible danger to life that is involved. So when we are considering "catchment areas" in rural Wales, we must think not in terms of 150,000 to 200,000 or more, but of about 100,000 to 125,000.<br><br>
I turn now to the use which should be made of the smaller hospitals when the major centres eventually come into operation. They should, wherever possible, be preserved. A great real of sentiment attaches to these local hospitals, particularly those which have been given to a locality by a benefactor or through a charity, or, as the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) mentioned, through the meagre funds of the miners themselves. But there are practical reasons for their preservation as well. It is not possible, in any realistic allocation of finance, to run the new service and at the same time the existing service exactly as it is today.<br><br>
However, the plan does envisage that there will be considerable scope for using these hospitals for the care of the chronic sick and geriatric cases. One could also consider them as medium hospitals, for use as maternity homes and for general practitioner beds for minor casualties. One of the arguments against the big district general hospital is that it makes visiting very difficult. We are all familiar with this human problem. If these local hospitals can be used for long-stay patients, that would largely dispose of that objection.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the protest war. It has, of course, taken an acute form in South Wales. I believe that, in Crick-howell, it even brought the threat of a local general strike. There was a meeting in Barry attended by members of many local authorities from Glamorgan and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
Monmouthshire. If I may dare to refer to the case of Llwynypia, I understand from the speech of the hon. Member for Rhondda, East, that the opposition in the Rhondda to closure has even united the pubs and the chapels, which is indeed a historic phenomenon in Wales. The opposition in north Wales is equally strong, if less militant, and people in my constituency are concerned about a number of hospitals, ranging from Colwyn Bay through Denbigh and Llangwyfan to Llangollen.<br><br>
How has this very justifiable protest arisen? The Welsh Hospital Board itself is not happy about the position. I pay a tribute to the Chairman of the Board, who, I am sure, would like to see increased consultation. I understand that much of the trouble has resulted from strict instructions sent out by the former Health Department—now no longeroperative in Wales—that no proposals could be published before being submitted to the Secretary of State. Naturally, boards want to submit detailed proposals to a Minister, and general practitioners and the public can be forgiven if they think that the matter is cut and dried in advance. There is everything to be said for the suggestion of the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones), that there should be a public enquiry into these cases.<br><br>
In the debate five years ago the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), correctly anticipating the result of the forthcoming General Election, gave certain advice to what he described as the "incoming Labour Government". I could return the compliment and ask for replies to my questions from the "outgoing Labour Government".<br><br>
One of the hon. Member's serious complaints was the acute shortage of geriatric beds in an area of Monmouthshire with which he was familiar. I hasten to add that the then Minister for Welsh Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) said that considerable progress had been made under the Conservative Government, although he agreed that the position was not satisfactory. In fact, the Boucher Commission had recommended a figure of 1.4 beds per 1,000 for geriatric cases and the figure in 1964 was 1.14. I should like to be informed about the present position, if not today, perhaps later.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1486">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
I have been given certain disturbing figures—I cannot vouch for them—about the places available for mentally handicapped children in Wales. A good deal needs to be done here. Certainly a third of all the mental patients in Wales are in buildings erected before 1900. Some wards hold up to 60 patients and many of the inmates have been there for a long time. I entirely agree with the Secretary of State that everything possible should be done to enable as many as possible of these unfortunate people to take their place in the community.<br><br>
This transfer of functions represents a vast increase in the Secretary of State's responsibility, and we wish him well in his work. This subject transcends party boundaries, and I can assure him, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Barry, that there will be no carping criticism from my party with regard to the work which he has to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. White</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will not expect me, in slightly more than a quarter of an hour, to deal with all the problems of the health and welfare services in Wales, but my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend and I have greatly appreciated the sprit of this debate. It has been on the whole, extremely constructive. I am sure that hon. Members will not take it amiss if I suggest that there are some subjects, particularly those with a special local interest, which, although I do not like late hours any more than they do, would be good subjects for Adjournment debates, when one could reply in more detail than is possible or appropriate this morning.<br><br>
It is significant that much of the discussion has centred on the hospital services, but I would remind hon. Members that the general practitioner service is the one on which most people depend for the greater part of their lives. The advent to hospital is the exception and not the rule, so we should be much concerned with local practitioner services and the other responsibilities of the local executive councils.<br><br>
It is also important to keep in proportion the local authority services. They are not quite as dramatic as some of the problems in the hospital services, but it is clear from our study of this matter that a tremendous amount depends, and is even more likely to depend in future, on the quality and extent of the health and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
welfare services provided by local authorities. The trend in the modern hospital is to have a greater speeding up of patient passage, so that they spend a shorter time in hospital, if this can be managed, which means that a greater strain is put on the domiciliary services—nursing and health visitors and so on.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
We are all aware that some of the strain on the hospital services is because, particularly in the geriatric and mental health spheres, we do not have sufficient provision in the local authority services to take patients who could be discharged from hospitals if there were suitable accommodation available for them either in residential homes or hostels or in their own homes, provided that the supporting services were able to cope. The modern trend is that, wherever possible, we should try to keep people in their own home circumstances. I am sure that this is what we should all aim for. I know that it is not always possible, but I think that the local authority services—the home nurses, home helps and the health visitors—between them can make, and are making, a tremendous contribution. I should welcome the opportunity at some later stage of a debate in which we could put the greatest emphasis on this side of the health and welfare services. Nevertheless, we must recognise that a great deal of discussion is currently proceeding in Wales on the structure and organisation of the health service.<br><br>
I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute from the Welsh Office to the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board, his colleagues and staff. They are tackling the major reorganisation in Wales with great energy and sympathy. I am sure that we would all like to recognise this.<br><br>
We have tremendously speeded up the expenditure on Welsh hospital services in the last few years. I do not want to make party political points in an otherwise non-controversial debate, but it is generally recognised that the 1950s was a period of fallow in the hospital services, and it took a very long time for hospital development to take place. I should like to give one or two figures in illustration. The National Health Service started just over 20 years ago. It was not until 1956 that expenditure in Wales on capital development of hospitals touched the £1
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1487">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
million mark. It had been hovering between approximately £1 million and £2 million until 1964 when it went up to £3½ million. From then on there has been a substantial increase. In 1965 it was nearly £5 million. In 1966 it was £5¾ million. There was then a slight pause because various major developments had been completed, so that in 1967 the figure dropped to £4¾ million. In 1968 the figure was £6,375,000. This year it is £7.3 million, and the forecast for 1970 is around £8 million. It is quite clear that we are vigorously carrying forward hospital expansion in Wales. It might interest hon. Members to know that in the present financial year we shall be spending about £48 million on hospital services, which is almost double what it was in 1960. However, it is not just a question of more; it is a question of where and how, which is very much exercising the minds of hon. Members.<br><br>
I was asked by the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower), and the hon. Member for Denbigh (Mr. Geraint Morgan) repeated the question, about the norm for planning district general hospitals. It is true that in parts of Wales the thinness of population means that the sort of norm applicable in other areas is irrelevant, but in general terms the Welsh Hospital Board is working to a norm of 100,000 to 150,000 population to sustain a district general hospital. I say that with reservations, because there are obviously areas where this is not applicable. For example, I was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies), ought we not to recast the 1962 pattern? My hon. Friend spoke about the need for medium-sized hospitals. Where medium-sized hospitals make sense, we are building them. Aberystwyth and Wythybush are cases in point.<br><br>
Many people are concerned not so much with the district based hospitals as with the peripheral or intermediate hospitals, the smaller existing hospitals, and what happens to them. My right hon. Friend, as he has already indicated, and the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board, are acutely conscious of the problems raised by the existing pattern of hospital provision. That goes equally for myself. After all, my own family came from one of the mining valleys. A few weeks ago I went to visit my cousin in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
small hospital in Rhymney. I could see the problems which would be caused if we did not have certain types of provision—I underline that—nearer to centres of population than some of the large base hospitals can be.<br><br>
That brings me to a point which I hope that all hon. Members, whatever the emotional and political or quasi-political pressures which are put upon them in dealing with these matters, will do their utmost genuinely to appreciate. I refer to the medical and scientific arguments which may be the other way in certain circumstances. We are all lay people in this Committee as far as medical matters are concerned. Who are we to refute the arguments put forward by the most distinguished surgeons and physicians in the land that for certain types of cases it is far more important that they should go to centres where there are the full diagnostic and emergency treatment facilities than that they should be dealt with at smaller units where those facilities do not exist and could never be provided? It is essential that we should try to look at each situation genuinely on its merits and that we should try to make the most intelligent evaluation that we possibly can.<br><br>
We are also very concerned—here again I know that I am speaking for my right hon. Friend and also for the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board—about public opinion and the whole process of consultation in these difficult matters. The Welsh Office is trying to speed up the procedure by which these consultations take place. There has been difficulty in the past. Rumours get around, quite understandably, because various discussions must take place before any firm proposals can be put forward. But the period has perhaps been unduly prolonged. This is a matter to which we are now paying considerable attention. I am doubtful whether we can settle such matters at a public meeting, as was suggested by one of my hon. Friends.<br><br>
Full discussions are taking place in north Monmouthshire and in the Swansea area following the first part of the Singleton reorganisation. These are full formal discussions with the local authorities and local interests concerned. In other places this is not so, because matters are still at a preliminary stage. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me, even if I had time, to deal with various local matters
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1968-1969V006P0I1488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
which have been raised by hon. Members concerning hospitals in their own areas.<br><br>
Llandudno is a case in point. We have not yet reached the stage for formal discussion in Llandudno and other areas. That does not mean that considerable thought is not being given to the matters that have been raised—for example, the west Wales patients who are now at Hensol Castle, and so on. A great deal of thought and discussion is going on about these matters, but I cannot at this moment deal with them. The Welsh Hospital Board is responsible for priorities, for planning and for consultation. My right hon. Friend has the ultimate decision, but all the preliminary planning work is the responsibility of the Welsh Hospital Board.<br><br>
I should dearly like to deal with some of the wider matters raised, more particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Conway, but also touched upon by other hon. Members, on the whole organisation of the health and welfare services, the Green Paper, the Seebohm Report, and so forth. However, time does not permit. I think that we could have another useful debate on that. I can say that we are taking part in the discussions which are being carried on by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services with the various organisations concerned with the replanning of the health and welfare services.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
I am reminded by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Ifor Davies) that we are in consultation with the Department of Education and Science about the future of the teaching hospital organisation, including the proposal for a hospital in Swansea. Whether we shall have a different organisation in Wales is a matter which will need much thought and consideration. My right hon. Friend may possibly take up the suggestion that at a later stage, when we have more experience in the matter, it will be helpful to bring out some kind of White Paper, perhaps with green edges, about hospital and health services in the Principality.<br><br>
Meanwhile, it is an extremely interesting and challenging time to have taken over these new responsibilities, because we are involved in discussions which affect, at least for a generation to come, the organisation of services which are very close to our interests and hearts. I hope that on some future occasion we will be able in more detail to go into a number of these matters.</span></p>
