	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> [	<i>This day</i>], That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Statement of Government Proposals for Reorganising Local Government in Wales.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>4.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been arguing that government, local and national, should be based on community. Now I turn to the national community. If the central Government, as a part of their local government reorganisation, had established an elected Council for Wales, with planning powers and adequate finance, this would have had value. And if the Government are concerned with the good of Wales, and with what the people of Wales want, this would have been done. However, this has not been done and it is now most unlikely that it will be done, by the present Government at any rate. This may be the last Labour Government that we will see at Westminster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Advisory Council was a worthless and derisory gesture. Wales was united in asking for an elected Council. The political parties were united and the trade unions were behind it. The chance nevertheless has been lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I mishear the hon. Gentleman? Did he say that the political parties were united in wanting an elected council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood this to be the position, but I am open to correction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In this part of the room, it is practically impossible, Mr. Probert, to hear anything that the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. George Thomas)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues his speech, will he tell me what powers he would like the elected council to carry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essential powers of planning: powers which would give the ability to plan economic growth in Wales; powers, for which we have been calling for the last generation, for a planning council in Wales. Those are the fundamental ones, but there are many others, which I will not go into now, which should be added. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State wishes me to make another speech. I would certainly award powers over water, for example, to the council, and powers in matters of health, hospitals and major roads. It should be given powers in regard to heavy industries and, in particular, to the coal industry. All these things, which are now dealt with by nationalised boards, should be part of the scope of this national council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now advancing quickly towards national freedom in Wales, and in two or three years' time the idea of a national council will be no more than a piece of flotsam thrown up by the tide of history. There will be a Government of the Welsh people, for and by the Welsh people, and it will be too late then to talk about a national council. If the Government are to establish it, the idea is a good one, but if not, then it will be too late and the idea should be dropped. Indeed, the proposals for reorganisation of local government should be dropped now, to allow a Welsh Parliament to examine the matter and to legislate on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my turn to follow the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans), and I am glad that he returned to the local government aspect of the papers that have been published. However, I do not want to follow him to Switzerland or anywhere else this afternoon, because I am more concerned that a local authority in my constituency should spend a three-farthing rate to buy a typewriter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall, perhaps, have the honour at some other time of listening more to the hon. Gentleman about the philosophical aspects of his ideas on local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend bear in mind that he is wise to avoid Switzerland this afternoon, since it has already been announced that that country, which the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) cited as an excellent example of harmonious democracy, now appears to be a country with a great deal of dissent and it seems that the splinter French groups want to leave it altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) will not wish to pursue the matter of Switzerland. Let us get back to the Statement, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand obliquely reproved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not do that, Mr. Probert, because I have never been regarded as a fighter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the statement of the Secretary of State in the circular issued to local authorities on 21st November, and also what he said this morning. He made a' very important statement, which I gladly accept in general. But I thank him particularly, and I am sure that I speak on behalf of all of us who are Members of Parliament and on behalf of staffs of local authorities, for indicating the likely provisions of new legislation concerning the staff commission. I hope that he will bear in mind that there are associations of staff, and it will be a good thing if they can be represented. A good example of that was the London reorganisation some years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather disappointed that we now seem to be letting the reins go, as it were. I remember when my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) first grasped the nettle and stuck to it at that time. I was glad to hear his statement, followed afterwards by that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. Cledwyn Hughes) and of my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have declared my interest in local government for me, but as a Member of Parliament I support what is in the White Paper and the statement with regard to the setting up of the three counties of Radnor, Brecon and Montgomery for the new Powys Coun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
cil. I do this because I represent, not six local authorities, as one hon. Member said this morning, but 21 local authorities. I shall not go through all those 21 local authorities to see what they have to say. There are eight rural authorities and district councils in Radnorshire and 11 in Breconshire. That is enough of a text for one afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Maerdy Jones and the late Edgar Chappell years ago advocated that something should be done about local government, and we are still at it. Judging by what has been said this morning—apart from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and I shall come to him afterwards—we shall not get it for the next five or six years. I do not agree with that at all. I am disappointed in the timetable given in the circular. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is therefore highly improbable that the appointed day for the assumption of responsibility by the new authorities will be before 1st April 1972. If legislation is not passed in the 1969–70 session, then the appointed day will be a year or more after 1st April, 1972".</p></blockquote>
That invites delay in the proposals. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary may say that there is a great deal of work to be done. I would remind them that it is possible for legislation to go through this Committee at any time, directly there has been a Second Reading of new legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why we should wait until 1972 for the implementation of what is already known to us. I hope that some matters may be looked at in the meantime. I remind hon. Members that the Secretary of State is a Cabinet Minister and is concerned with matters within Wales, amongst other things. He should not give way to any other Cabinet Minister over legislation which is less important than legislation for Wales. Measures for the economic situation of the country should take first priority, but the next priority is legislation in connection with local government reorganisation. The endurance of those of us who are connected with local government in Wales is equally as important as anything else for which any other Minister may canvass support in the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not wait for the Maud Commission Report or the Scottish Report. We did not intend doing that, I gather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
from the first White Paper on reorganisation. We said that we would wait for it with regard to the functions of finance. Conversations and consultations were going on with local authorities associations and are still going on. How can we carry on with the present position without awaiting their outcome? I respectfully suggest that if we get the Commission's Report by the end of March, another four or five years will be needed before the English Commission's proposals may be implemented. Are we to wait all that time? We ought to get on with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) referred to the Royal Commission, but in my estimation local government reorganisation should go on. It was said in the statement that local authorities will be consulted. I hope that these consultations will not be prolonged, because not so much discussion is now required. There is not a great deal of change in the proposals, although some of them may be important for other hon. Members to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary of State and his Ministers for the kind way in which they have handled the consultations with the local authorities, either jointly or in local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Member agree that if we were to implement the proposals and then change them basically because of what is recommended in the English and Scottish Commission Reports, it would be an expensive matter? The country simply cannot afford such expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to the expense, I can suggest even to the present Government where they could reduce expenditure in favour of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to query the provisions of the new Bill because my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has gone out of his way to tell us beforehand what is likely to be contained in its provisions. Will the Bill itself contain the provisions of the new reorganisation, or are we to have an Order in Council? This is an important point, because I would prefer that the Schedule of the Bill should list all the changes so that if we wish to put down Amendments, we can do so.
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give us an idea of what the Bill will contain. If we are to have a combination of counties, is it likely that in the Bill statutory bodies like National Health Service executive councils will have provision made for them in the Bill, or are they to remain as they are at present? Speaking as one with experience in this respect, I should prefer that all committees, whether statutory or voluntary, should be retained within the counties despite amalgamation. There are others to be considered—for example, water boards with different boundaries and fire services. All these are important aspects which, I am sure, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales will note. There is one advisory committee in each county for the appointment of magistrates with lords lieutenants as chairmen. I have seen other local government Orders in which provision is made for these bodies. Will legislation cover matters such as National Parks? I had better not dwell on that too much. In reply to what has been suggested by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Donnelly), I am glad that amalgamation has been the order of the day and not dismemberment of any county boundaries. Some district councils think that they are now great fish in little pools and that they will be small fish in larger pools under the reorganisation and they want to have their own small pool among themselves on the border of the County of Breconshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would tell my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) that there is a steering committee in his constituency at present contacting some of the district councillors in my constituency to oppose these proposals. I hope that the Ministers of the Welsh Office will oppose them as well. I do not wish to dismember the County of Breconshire at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 24, the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Bill is passed, a period of between 18 months and 2 years will have to be allowed between its passing and the appointed day for the new authorities to take on their full range of responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
What I am asking is this: what guidance will be given to the new authorities in their set-up? I do not want us to go,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
suddenly or in whatever period it may come, straight away into the new authorities. There ought to be a shadow committee examining them in detail beforehand. It is very important that guidance should be given by the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the important aspect of electoral divisions within any county on reorganisation. The Home Office will have charge of this. Surely that matter ought to have been considered by the existing counties rather than by larger counties. They have more knowledge of the matter. I hope that the Secretary of State will give guidance to the new authorities, and, in respect of amalgamating three areas, as in the county of Powys, will realise that there are areas in both counties which require special consideration in terms of human services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to light the candle—if it requires lighting—on behalf of parish councils—the third tier of the local authority system. I am very proud that the Secretary of State for Wales has given them a higher status than they have had before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had consultations in Newtown with representatives of associations and I know that there is more intelligent thinking and criticism coming from parish councils than from county councils, district councils or urban councils, in that respect. They are more with the people, and I want to preserve that situation. In fact, 90 per cent. of parish councils in Wales are members of the Association of Parish Councils, and the memorandum has been submitted by them to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also say, in connection with the parish councils, that in the last Government White Paper on Wales there is this statement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The areas of the present parishes should be reviewed by the new county councils so as to strengthen their ability to carry out their new functions."</p></blockquote>
That is all right, but I think that this ought to be done by the counties before they amalgamate, in readiness for the new proposals to be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot expect you to take part in a debate of this kind, Mr. Probert, but I know that you are interested in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
boundaries. If there are difficulties with regard to boundaries or electoral divisions of parish councils, they can be left over for the time being. I know that in the case of Hirwaun, for instance, you and I may not agree to which county it should go. I want to retain it for the present time with the idea that, later on, that kind of township should go to the most efficient and convenient one for the local authorities. If it is left to the new set-up, one can envisage that nothing will be done about boundaries of parish councils and amalgamations of them until 1977 or 1978. Those of us who are concerned with this are fearful about all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of areas like those we have in Breconshire and Radnorshire—there are nine urban areas in both counties—if the proposals are accepted they will have no local government structure. It is suggested that they should be common councils. One translates "common" into Welsh and finds that it has not the same meaning at all. We do not want that. Let us have a general council or a local council. I am certain that in the final analysis when the question is posed to those of us who are Members of Parliament, "Do you really want reorganisation?" our answer will be that we do. I do not want something else instead of it. We can pay tribute to our local government service, and I am glad that the opportunity has come to the Welsh Grand Committee to discuss it. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will give us some indication of the Government's view on rating. Should it rest with the new county authorities or with the district councils in the future? The majority opinion is in favour of the districts being in charge of rating. I have acceded to your request, Mr. Probert, not to speak too long. I have not really got going. I have merely got down to brass tacks and I have gone away from some of the big upward ideas in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this is the first time that we have discussed local government reorganisation in Wales in this Committee, there has, as the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Padley) pointed out this morning, been an infinity of discussion about it. Speaking for myself, it is a subject I have lived
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
with practically all the time I have been a Member of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State reminded us this morning that suggestions about this were made as far back as 1939 by the late Mr. Arthur Jenkins. The matter has been on the stocks, so far as the work of the Local Government Commission is concerned, even since 1958, and even now, of course, we are made very much aware in the course of this debate that the end is still not in sight. It is something in respect of which all of us would want to see some finality if it is possible. It seems quite clear, does it not, that there is very little chance of any legislation in the course of this Parliament? A recent letter from the Secretary of State to Welsh local authorities has, in fact, asked for yet further representation with regard to the most recent Government declaration of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now invited to wait for the Report of the Local Government Commission for England. I say this with regret, but I suppose that now we have waited so long, we may as well wait until that Report appears. We are told that it will do so within the next few months. No one can fairly claim that we have not had enough time in which to consider ths issue, and to consider it very carefully. So much time has elapsed since the initial proposals of the Local Government Commission that hon. Members may be forgiven if they forget what happened at that early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an example of that this morning from the hon. Member for Perbroke (Mr. Donnelly), who talked about the then "Mr. Brooke's plan". I do not doubt that Lord Brooke of Cumnor in his time may have made mistakes as Minister for Welsh Affairs, but nothing of that sort can be attributed to him in this connection, because the proposals that appeared in 1961 and 1962 were those of the Commission. The first Government declaration on this matter was made only in July of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the Secretary of State's request to local authorities in his letter is concerned, it is really the fourth time of asking. We had the draft proposals of the Commission in 1961 and the so-called final proposals at the end of 1962. We have had the Government White Paper in July, 1967, and now we have had a quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
serious change in the White Paper proposals by the present Secretary of State. I will refer shortly to this later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were two violent differences of approach so far as the Commission itself is concerned, and now we have this change of mind by the Government. It has also been very obvious from the debate today that these differences cut across party lines absolutely. I must make that quite clear, because my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) this morning talked about opposition to the White Paper from this side of the Committee. It is not universal opposition. I suppose that I can claim that I account for one-third of the Conservative representation in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But more than that in quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never, as my hon. Friend knows, opposed the White Paper solution, which I regard as the proper one. I can appreciate the Secretary of State's agony of soul when he said this morning that the views expressed by myself and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) during the Welsh debate were diametrically opposed and that he could not please us both. I am only sorry that, at the end of it all, he has come down on the wrong side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals and counter-proposals on this issue have been made for so long that, just as one may be forgiven for forgetting what appeared in the earlier proposals, so one may tend to forget precisely why the Welsh Local Government Commission was appointed to undertake its work long before the Commissions for England and Scotland. The reasons are clearly set out in the White Paper. Part of them was referred to by the hon. Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) this morning. He said that the White Paper talks of the need for early action being particularly urgent in Wales. One can find in the same paragraph this particularly significant passage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of these small authorities are facing increasingly serious difficulties in securing expert staffs, in placing economically large orders for goods and equipment and in coping with contingencies that larger authorities can take in their stride."</p></blockquote>
There is also a quotation on page 3 of the White Paper from the Report of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
the Local Government Commission which puts the matter in a nutshell. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our proposition is simply that there is a minimum size in terms of population and resources below which the full range of county functions cannot be effectively carried out."</p></blockquote>
However unpalatable amalgamation may be, and it must be so to many people, I think that this makes the case for amalgamation overwhelming. I think that, by now, most people in Wales accept the necessity for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far back as 1961, in the draft proposals of the Commission, the conclusion was reached that amalgamation of one kind or another was the only answer to this problem. Indeed, even then it was by no means a novel idea. I would remind the Committee that, as far back as 1947, the Report of the Committee which sat under Sir Malcolm Trustram-Eve recommended amalgamation—significantly enough in view of one of the atters which we are discussing today in the form of the union of the five North Wales counties.

Looking back over the mists of the years, I think it very unfortunate that the 1961 proposals were not better received than they were. I believe that that results, not so much from any defects in the proposals themselves as from the fact that, at that time at any rate, Welsh local authorities had not really attuned themselves to the idea of amalgamation. There were many aspects of those proposals which, I believe, made them better than any which have appeared since. For example, an effort was made in those 1961 proposals to deal with the problem of authorities which are weak or strong in terms of rateable value by uniting, for example, the counties of Brecon and Radnor with Monmouthshire to form the County of Gwent, and to unite the county of Montgomery with the counties of Flint and Denbigh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever view one takes of those proposals, they were far more acceptable than the later ones of 1962, which were very revolutionary and very ill-received in Wales. I can only presume that the Commission, having found so little responses to its Report in 1961, decided that something pretty revolutionary was necessary in order to draw attention to its find-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
ings. As members will remember these "final proposals" involved, among other things, the tearing-apart of existing counties—three counties would have disappeared altogether. A vast mid-Wales county was to be created, and there was little affinity or traditional connection between many parts of it. There was also the striking anomaly whereby Anglesey was left out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote an article on this recently, and I was taken to task afterwards by the Chairman of the Anglesey County Council for not giving the correct reason for Anglesey's being left out. I would like to make amends to the Chairman of the County Council. What I said was that Anglesey was left out because the Commission decided that there was great strength of local feeling against it. It has been pointed out to me that another reason was that there had been a very high standard of administration in Anglesey. That, of course, I accept, but the same arguments could be used against fusion in many other parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that those proposals were very wisely shelved by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph). In effect, we went back to square one. Some curious reasons were, incidentally, put forward in those proposals for the boundaries which were then suggested. For example, it was pointed out that the new boundaries suggested then would be similar to those of the estates of mediaeval landowners. I would not have thought that that would necessarily appeal very much to the radical Welsh as an argument. It presupposes an undue concern by the Welsh people, with their mediaeval past, and also a readiness on their part to thrown overboard the county boundaries to which they have now become accustomed during four centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least one good thing resulted from the unpopular proposals of 1962. The Government have been very careful—and I congratulate them for this—to make sure that any changes in boundaries which now takes place should follow existing boundaries in the sense that counties are to be amalgamated and not torn apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the end of that chapter. Then followed four years of reflection. The Conservative Government did not have very much time to reflect because the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
General Election of 1964 followed shortly after the rejection of these proposals by the then Conservative Government, but of course, it gave ample time to successive Secretaries of State in the present Government to consider this matter. One must accept that the Minister of Agriculture the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Cledwyn Hughes), must, when Secretary of State, have had considerable consultation with local authorities before he came to the important conclusion that the best solution for North Wales was the amalgamation of the five counties. It should also be remembered in this connection that the Minister is a North Wales Member and that he knows this area intimately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a much lower plane, I myself made as careful inquiries as I could in my own constituency about a possible union of the five counties. I must say, I found considerable support for it in all parts of my quite variegated constituency, both in the anglicised areas along the coast and in the "cefn gwlad". Of course, there are differences of opinion. That must be so. But it is significant that the idea of a big county was supported by the Denbighshire County Council by a decisive majority on two occasions, and also, of course, that two other counties—Anglesey and Merioneth—at any rate supported this solution in preference to the present one. If I may respectfully say so to the right hon. Gentleman, it is something of a quibble when he says in his letter to local authorities that only one county supported those proposals in their actual form. I think in the last analysis one may fairly say that it was a majority of three to two of the five counties in favour of amalgamation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite satisfied that this is the best solution. I will not dwell upon the advantages which have been referred to already, but it would certainly create a strong unit of local government with a rateable value of some £19 million. It is significant that this area already constitutes one police authority, and it would be most important for the planning of communications, which is of great concern to us because of our tourist industry. At the present time there is a good deal of feeling in Colwyn Bay, the largest town in my constituency, about
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
a certain road which is being planned to go through the town. It occurs to me that if there had been a union of the five counties long ago, all these things could have been planned very differently and that that particular problem would never have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find also that the excuse used—I hope that I do not use too sinister a word—in the letter for having two counties instead of one is rather inconclusive. It speaks of the lack of homogeneity between North-East and North-West Wales. This savours rather of a kind of apartheid of which I could not possibly approve. This morning, the hon. Member for Pembroke made a similar plea with regard to his own county, which he wanted to have extracted from the Dyfed union. He complained that there was opposition to teaching of the Welsh language, and so on. I do not agree with him about that, but, just assuming that I am wrong and he is right, if the Government are logical, they should take Pembrokeshire out of Dyfed in the same way that they have divided up these counties in North Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have said already, these views cut across party lines. There is one matter that I feel that I must refer to in this connection, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford will forgive me for doing so. He has expressed publicly the view that there is a very overwhelming feeling in the County of Denbigh against the proposed union. I can only say this. I understand that he has made some voyage of discovery into the County of Denbigh, but. unfortunately, his ports of call do not seem to have included either the Denbighshire Council Council or, what I regard as equally important, the local government officers serving the Denbighshire County Council. Both of them are, in fact, in support of this union. In any event, it is quite anomalous that the biggest town in my constituency—indeed, the biggest town along the North Wales coast—Colwyn Bay, which is already the centre of the police authority, and is well suited to be the capital of a North Wales county, should under this present dispensation be right on the edge of the proposed County of Clwyd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be abundantly sure, since we have waited so long for a solution, that it should be the right one for North

Wales. In conclusion, therefore, I ask the Secretary of State to hesitate, and hesitate long, before he confirms the quite startling reversal of policy which he recently announced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to listen to the constructive contribution of the hon. Member for Denbigh (Mr. Geraint Morgan). I wish that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) would take some of the other hon. Members in hand and give them lessons in elocution. Everyone in the Committee could hear what both hon. Members had to say without difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Grand Committee will be grateful to the Secretary of State for his opening survey of the Government's proposals regarding reorganisation of local government in Wales. His assurances regarding a Wales Staff Commission, his emphasis upon the basing of proposals of reorganisation on the same kind of authority, the retention of the three-tier system and the ultimate reduction of Councils by 50 per cent. into larger and, I hope, more efficient units have been guardedly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) tried hard to get my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to say when the Bill implementing the proposals would be tabled. Support for him came from the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Donnelly). Previously, the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) stuck his neck out quite voluntarily in estimating when the proposals would be implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wrong. What I said was that I was convinced that the present Government, with their present large majority, have no intention of bringing the Bill before the House at all. I regretted that. I also warned them that perhaps they would not hold that majority for very long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recorded something about sticking out the neck, and I thought that the hon. Member did it quite voluntarily in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still a fair way to go before all our difficulties are resolved. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State might
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
well have given a Christmas flavour to his statement today by concluding, "Sip slowly. It takes years to make." Twenty-nine years ago, this matter was looked upon as needing attention and now, as has been mentioned, the Local Government Commission, which reported first in 1961, has the same task of reorganisation. There is still a fair way to go before the job of translating the proposals into detailed legislation is through and my estimate—I know how dangerous it is to give an estimate—of the operation is that it will be 1975 before the job is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Grand Committee takes a hand in the fermentation and blending processes and democracy's job is to refine the final product, perhaps 	<i>par excellence.</i> There is much hope of it being smooth and mellow. The Departmental Working Committee got the ingredients together—the stronger and larger elements of the population, acreage and rateable value—and put them into the vat. Further nameless people suggested by local authority associations, were brought in for informal discussion. One can imagine all the doodling and the drawing and the scrapping series after series of maps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now seem to have reached some finality with the issue of the Secretary of State's Circular of 21st November, 1968. The pattern becomes more fixed unless the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England are such as to cause another look to be given at the proposed pattern for Wales. I think this probability is remote, but one cannot say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper and the Circular give us the larger units of local government, but whether this is synonymous with stronger local government is open to doubt. The sprawling areas of Mid- and Northern Wales are larger in acreage but remain weak in population and rateable value. It is rateable value that is so often the propeller to enable local government to do things better—finer housing, erasement of slums, proud schools, health services, roads, care of the aged, helping the mentally retarded and the physically disabled, and modern sewerage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these amenities need a tremendous amount of money. People want them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
fiercely, but it is financial ability that gets them past the awkward turns and difficult corners. Merely marking out larger local government units does not give the vital element of financial sufficiency for the work to be done, especially in the way that we would like it to be done. Those generating the forces of change giving us the new set up must avoid this shortcoming. It seems to be an integral shortcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk of doing something in the old way we feel the dread of dislocation and the objection to any improvement that really touches us. Otherwise we all like to be thought progressive. Already there are eddies, much as it may be sought to repress them. We cling to the old way for many of its fine associations, but there is the new hard, serious, fighting, interesting and satisfying life yet to be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the reorganisation we are facing, there are bound to be assents and dissents. Parliament has to be the voice of varying sizeable viewpoints. Later I shall make some dissenting noises. I think my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, East expects that. Nevertheless, in the proposals as presented there are good and sensible combinations that should make for better local government. There is substantial support for them. Their translation into detailed legislation will be closely watched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three sizeable local councils in my constituency—not like Brecon where half a dozen houses make up a local authority—which over the years have given good standards of service. Under the proposals of the White Paper the Pontypridd Urban Council is to be enlarged. On the other hand the Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre Rural Council is to be shared between the Rhondda and Pontypridd urban councils respectively, and Cowbridge Rural is to be merged entirely with Barry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his circular, the Secretary of State confirms these proposals. For each of such councils, being blotted out is a deep disappointment—that is recognised by the Secretary of State—because each submitted sound alternatives for consideration. However, these have not carried the Secretary of State to their side. The pattern to be is set. Consequently, in my
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
constituency two fine local councils are to see their respective civic centres become like a tent that will presently be folded up and taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I fail to understand is why Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre Councils should be folded up before the Buchanan Report on the Llantrisant new town has seen the light of day and decisions made. My contention is that it would be far better to freeze any proposals pertaining to Rhondda, Pontypridd and Llantrisant until our minds are fully informed as to the extent of the new town, because the new town is right in the centre of these changes. No one knows where its boundaries will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boundaries of these councils, as confirmed by the Secretary of State, might need alterations again when the new town is established. It does not make sense to me for reorganisation to proceed when faced with possible recommendations that could again transform the pattern for the Llantrisant area. In this drama of possible loss of identity through reorganisation, neither Llantrisant nor Cowbridge want even to think of the time when the curtain will come down. To the populace of the councils concerned, it is disdained with anger and looked upon as a kiss of unseemly taste. Everybody there blows off whiffs of protest and makes it plain that discontent will deepen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, it is known that Rhondda's aldermen and councillors have been making wooing noises and likening Llantrisant to the most exciting thing here at the moment. In comparison, even the headlines of the 	<i>Daily Express</i> seem utterly dull. However, the embraces are not welcome. Such is the temper of my constituents in the area affected that they consider the proposals as mushy as a boiled turnip. I must voice their disagreement with Rhondda's proposals, as so eloquently pleaded by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, East. He has been a determined advocate, putting his case extremely well, logically and cogently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my constituents are idealists. They want the shape of local councils in Wales to be superior to anything else on God's earth. I can see plainly the steps that must be taken to pass from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
present unsatisfactory complex to the new one, but the proposal is still only a prospectus. Will the councils, and their army of councillors, take up their shares? Will these civic-conscious people, who talk and wish so well, do all possible to bring about the new order? There is some way to go yet to make the proposals credible, albeit that a substantial part of the proposals will prove successful and beneficial. I see nothing in them to justify fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State seeks our blessing for his fitting together of a pattern of local government in the Principality. I support orderly growth all the way. None of us wants Town "surgery" for its own sake. Let whatever is decided be based upon taking full account of all existing assets, both natural and man-made—and these are considerable in some of the areas. The Government's determined intention of reducing the number of authorities is plainly evident, and is backed up overall, I believe, by a fairly strongly based public opinion. It is no use flying in the face of such formidable factors. Let us endeavour to reduce the unfavourable elements in the White Paper so as to provide strength to enable whatever new authority emerges adequately to discharge its responsibilities. Local Government may change its form, but it must live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Elfed Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for referring to the way I put my case, but what proposal has he to put forward? At least we put proposals forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Rhondda, East wants me to go on for another half-an-hour, after being here since 10.30 this morning, I am quite prepared to do so, although I think that this would try the patience of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He and Rhondda know my proposals well enough. If they had only taken my advice long ago, we would not be up against this problem at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There has been admirable restraint by hon. Members, with one or two exceptions, in acceding to my request at the commencement of the Committee. There are a
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
number of hon. Gentlemen who wish to speak, and I hope that restraint will be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all appreciated the eloquent plea made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. S. O. Davies) and the hon. Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) on behalf of their respective constituencies. We also appreciated the special plea by my hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh (Mr. Geraint Morgan), who expressed his view of the North Wales complex. Otherwise, most speeches have been expressed in general terms and have revealed divisions of opinion on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not recapitulate the history of these events, because that has been done very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh. The decision, taken some years ago, to exclude Welsh local government from the examination in depth by the Royal Commissions in England and in Scotland, was vital. I will not argue its merits or demerits today, except to say that I disagreed with that decision, as did the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson). It is regrettable that we did not enjoy that detailed examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are considering Government proposals based on a wholly different type of examination of Welsh local government problems. It would be churlish of us not to recognise that a good deal of earnest consideration by many people has gone into this question. Lord Brooke of Cumnor and the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph), on our side of the House, and the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. James Griffiths), the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Cledwyn Hughes)—the present Minister of Agriculture—and the Secretary of State for Wales have all tackled this problem. A great deal of serious thought and examination have been put into this matter during that time. Nevertheless, I feel that it would have been far better had it enjoyed the more detailed type of examination which is afforded by a Royal Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's discussion is in advance of the publication of the findings of the two Royal Commissions. Whatever view we would have taken, perhaps even a few months ago, we must now recognise that since the publication of those findings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
is so near—perhaps only as far ahead as next February—it would be folly to proceed with any changes or to make any final decisions, and so utterly to disregard such guidance as may ensue from the findings of the Royal Commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested in one of the White Papers that we could make our decisions now, note what happens when the findings of the Royal Commissions are published, and then follow with a kind of polishing-up process. That would be quite irresponsible. These important changes are certain to last for a long time. Nothing is permanent, but they will be semipermanent. Firm proposals should not be framed, even if it were possible, without a careful look at the findings of the Royal Commissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obvious differences between local government problems in Wales and in other parts of the United Kingdom. As the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery intimated, there comparisons can be made between parts of North Wales and parts of the rural counties of Scotland, but there are great differences between the Southern part of Scotland and some parts of Wales, and there are obviously great differences between parts of England and parts of the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In proportion to its size, Wales has more substantial areas of small population. City regions in Wales would appear to be less viable as a basis for our considerations than they would in most parts of England. Wales has comparatively few large towns, and only one large city. Much of the territory is rural. In the South there are peculiar conurbations—in fact, they are not so much conurbations as long lines of urban development, often following valleys and lines of rivers. It is a most unusual area in respect of which to have to make decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 of Cmnd. 3340 states that the main county functions would seem to prescribe larger administrative units than at present, the recruitment of able staff and officers and the extra cost of modern buildings and equipment. These items give validity to the suggestion that county areas should be larger than at present. The question we must ask is: how much larger than at present? Are
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
we going too far with the proposals for these new counties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the six counties now suggested are an improvement on the five counties suggested in the original White Paper. The decision of the Secretary of State to substitute two North Wales counties—Gwynedd and Clwyd—in place of the former proposal of a single county is beneficial. The sheer size and difficult topography of North Wales must make some division desirable. About 80 miles from Flintshire to the western seaboard—my right hon. Friend the hon. Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) says, "More than that" and I accept from him that the distance is greater than that——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) think that we should wait for the recommendations of the Maud Commission before proceeding? Is he not aware that the Maud Commission is examining the situation of some authorities in England which are already geographically larger than the proposed North Wales counties? It is possible that we will receive recommendations for those counties as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that possibility, but since I have not had the benefit of seeing the Maud Report I am commenting on what we have before us. I do so with caution, because none of us can afford to be dogmatic. There are grounds for thinking that the difficult topography and geography of North Wales—and, sometimes, the rather difficult communications—a distance of 80 miles or more from East to West and an average of 50 to 60 from North to South prescribe a need for some division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also question the amount of community interests between residents of, say, Anglesey and residents near Wrexham and East Flint. I should have thought that there was a big divergence here which under certain circumstances might be difficult to reconcile. If we had new large county council areas it would be necessary to see that they had the widest range of functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it somewhat difficult to reconcile the setting up of such large units with the idea put forward by the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) and others, of an elected council with extensive powers. Such a council would have to obtain its powers either
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
from the Secretary of State or from the new big councils. We may be taking a big step forward, or making a big change, in setting up large new county authorities, and it could be injurious to their future effectiveness if, at the same time, we set up another large elected council with extensive powers. I do not wish to be dogmatic, but there appears to be a case for not doing these things at the same time, or even approximately at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share some of the doubts already expressed about the size of these new councils. I have some sympathy with the opinions expressed by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Donnelly) about the Dyfed proposals. Would a sufficient number of local people of ability and talent be prepared to participate in the workings of these very large councils, in view of the amount of travelling involved in attending county council meetings? It is a matter for surmise, but in some of these areas it would be a problem, which we shall have to consider carefully before we finalise our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Need the units be quite as extensive in some of these cases? Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us what consideration has been given to alternative benefits which might be obtained by smaller amalgamations? Has consideration been given to the possibility of the amalgamation of two counties rather than three? What consideration has been given to such amalgamations, with greater use of joint services, and greater joint buying of supplies? In the case of the smaller district council could not some offices be shared, as suggested by the hon. Member for Carmarthen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious danger of too many virtues being attached to mere size. In many instances the county councillor, even with our relatively small county councils, seems a remote figure compared with the district councillor, or the member of a small borough authority. The county councillor's name is sometimes not known by many of his constituents, although they usually have a rough idea of the name of the district councillor or borough councillor. We must be cautious about this worship of size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, too, that we will not sacrifice local patriotism, which is too often
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
maligned. It can be a very healthy thing. It can be a motive force. I am not sure that a person who serves the interests of Anglesey will display the same local patriotism in serving the interests of the proposed, somewhat inchoate area—although it has historical associations—of Gwynedd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, I am not quite sure that a person who serves my borough of Barry will display the same local patriotism in serving the nondescript combination of Barry, Penarth, Cardiff Rural District, Cowbridge Rural District, and so on. We are making a considerable sacrifice of this useful motive force of local patriotism, and we should consider the question carefully before reaching finality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposal for a Staff Commission, but if it is set up there will be a lapse of time before it is in operation. Would the Welsh Office consider, in that period before legislation, the institution of some form of register? I put forward the suggestion of a register in the Welsh Office because officials in the various Welsh local authorities are worried about their future. I agree that there will be a better career structure for some of those at the top, but those in the middle ranges are anxious about the situation. Can the Minister give us an assurance that every help will be given to them in finding their niche in any new set-up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out some of the problems. None of us regards the task which faces the Welsh Office as an easy one. It is right to face it with caution and circumspection. The cautious approach is the right one in dealing with this sort of problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution which the right hon. Gentleman seeks will have to exist for a long time. It would be folly to rush into it just for the sake of speed. It would be far better to work it out carefully with the benefit of all the wise advice we can get, including that of the Royal Commission. Having reached that stage we may have some hope of arriving at a lasting solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate on local government. Our comments on the White Paper are bound to be mixed. I think that Williams Parry's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
self-analysis would apply to any paper on local government reform:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yn wych yn wael</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yn gymysg ôll i gyd".</p></blockquote>
That is the sort of comment that one must make on a Report which affects so fundamentally one's constituency and one's areas of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear so many Members express the need for cold caution, and for delay in implementing these proposals. Whether we agree or disagree with the effect that the proposals will have on our own areas there is obviously an urgent need for reform of this kind. I shall undoubtedly cause offence to many district councillors when I say that my constituency has nine district councils and a population of 38,000, and that economic development is being held up, first, because the local authorities are too weak to give the kind of assistance which is required to undertake economic development and, secondly, because of uncertainty in the minds of the local authorities. They are cautious about taking any step to implement economic development because they are waiting for this reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not lie in the mouth of the Opposition to condemn the fact that my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and his predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. Cledwyn Hughes), have not proceeded by way of a commission in Wales. We have had too many commissions. I am not worried about the fact that in this case we have been advised by faceless men. I am more worried when I learn the names of some of those people who are advising us on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that Wales has a responsibility to proceed in its own way in reorganising local government. It surprised me to hear the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) suggesting that we might await the recommendations from the English Royal Commission.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggested that we were having the worst of all worlds. The right hon.

By reaching some conclusion now we will at least have gained some years over the English authorities in reforming our local government.

If we had been dealing with the recommendations of the White Paper of July, 1967, I should have been able to endorse the recommendations for my own constituency completely. I am sorry that the recommendation in that White Paper to have one county in North Wales has been amended. I will not dwell on the reasons given, but I cannot accept the argument that the main reason for rejecting the recommendation of the White Paper is that the response to it was overwhelmingly in favour of dividing the two counties. As this is the responsiblity of the Labour Government, I should like to say that scant regard has been paid to the views of Labour representation in North Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I should have been happier with a more radical proposal for North Wales, and I would have welcomed wholeheartedly a five-county authority in North Wales. There are many reasons for this view. First, speaking as a North Walian, we would have been given an administrative county with the same kind of status as the county of Glamorgan. There is always the feeling in North Wales that we are the poor relatives, a division based not only on wealth but on the feeling that the politics of Wales are dominated by a powerful Glamorgan authority. The proposal to create a five-county authority in North Wales would dispel some of that feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
Secondly, if local governments look at this proposal and accept it, at the very earliest it will be implemented by 1974. By that time local government will have more and more responsibility in economic development, and I do not think it possible to contemplate economic development in North Wales being divided between the counties of Flintshire and Denbighshire as one entity, and Anglesey, Caernarvon and Merioneth as a second. The lines of economic development in North Wales run from west to east. In fact, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in arguing against separatism in Wales was the first to use this argument. Economically, all lines of communication between my constituency, are from west to east. This is the way the economy of North Wales will develop, and this is the way the roads of North Wales will develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is another responsibility allied to economic development. If one is seeking secondary higher education and technical education in Wales, there is no part of the new authority now proposed by my right hon. Friend which will provide any kind of technical education in my constituency. Similarly, if it is decided that economic development is to be controlled by a planning authority, that planning authority should have the responsibility of planning the whole of North Wales. In these ways, I believe that the failure of the amendment my right hon. Friend has made to the White Paper is that he has given in far too easily to all the forces of reaction in North Wales, and nowhere are these forces stronger than amongst local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that by far the greatest support for the amendment has come from the county of Flintshire. I do not apologise for commenting on the way in which Flintshire has developed local government. It has done very well. It would be surprising if it had not. It is the wealthiest authority in the whole of Wales, and if I had been an hon. Member for Flintshire I would certainly be defending the county's right to make sure that the tremendous reserves that it has should be kept as far as possible for its own use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
The fact is that Flintshire has used those reserves in the most irresponsible way in the past. We have the white elephant of the Kelstenton Technical College; we have the white elephant of the new shire hall in Flintshire, built in the middle of economic recession and in times of economic restraint. And it has been done with such success that the shire hall has to a certain extent preempted the choice of my right hon. Friend in providing North Wales with a new and modern authority. I listened very carefully to the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. Arthur Pearson). In trying to create a local government administrative unit we should certainly look at the resources of that unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have done in North Wales in the present proposals is to create a compendium of poverty with poverty and wealth with wealth. We have not given North Wales as a whole an authority which would have a certain amount of independence, which is the important thing in local government. It is no use telling people that they have a district council or a county council or a regional council if it has not the financial means to be independent, and if it does not have the means to operate according to its own lights, whatever the economic situation of the rest of the country may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anglesey, Merioneth and Caernarvon have been made into a week, poor and subservient authority for all time, and if people do not bother to serve on that authority I will not be surprised, because that authority, time after time, would be able to do only what central Government told it to do. On the other hand, if we had a strong, wealthy authority covering the whole of North Wales it would be to the advantage of a person serving on that authority because he would have the independence that financial self-reliance would give him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has it occurred to the hon. Member that if such an authority were set up, its members would be predominantly from the eastern part of the area, from Flintshire and Denbigh, and very probably their concentration of interest would be on developments in the east of the area and they might tend to neglect the part of Anglesey and Caernarvon, whereas, if there is a separate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
authority the sole interests of the persons who are representing Caernarvon and Merioneth and Anglesey will be in that area and they will do the best they can for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We always believe in my constituency that we can match quantity with quality, and I do not think that we would have to worry about the kind of representation we would have. Furthermore—and this is the whole basis of the argument—the situation that most local authorities face in Wales now is that they are so dependent upon central Government for their resources that they are not able to carry out the priorities they want to carry out. They have to wait and be told by central Government, be it the Welsh Office or be it by Whitehall, what they can do. They cannot decide their own priorities, anyway, and we shall always be in that situation if we are to have the division of North Wales into two authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Wales should have its own degree of independence, and not only do I want to make sure that the nonsense of this division between North Wales and South Wales is ended for all time but I also want to be sure that in North Wales we have an authority which is capable of standing up to all the large English authorities which we are likely to have competing with us when the Maud Commission has reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are already talking in England about amalgamating authorities which are already bigger, in terms of income and size, than the authority which the five counties of North Wales would comprise. The hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) is aware of what happened when Tryweryn in my constituency was drowned in favour of Liverpool Corporation's water supply. This sort of thing could not happen if we had an authority in North Wales which was wealthy and powerful enough to control the whole economic entity of North Wales, and to do on our own the sort of thing that Liverpool was able to do. We could not do that with the kind of authority that we are now to be given by my right hon. Friend's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should proceed with the reform of local government. We should do it as quickly as possible, and we should proceed independently. I believe that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
proceeding independently we can make sure that Wales is going to be some kind of backwater, the kind of place where we pander to all the short-sighted people who want to cling on to the parish pump. We want to create a Wales that is powerful and modern enough to be an independent nation in its own right, with the same material and educational standards, the same planning facilities, as our neighbour in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has spotlighted the fact that there are several leading theories as to how local government should be organised, and that to some extent there are merits and defects about each of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I came to the House I served on Coventry City Council, one of the largest, and perhaps the most progressive, authority in England. Now I am privileged to represent Newport—a prosperous and go-ahead county borough, quite capable of standing on its own feet. We are essentially a mirror of our own experiences. Perhaps I may be forgiven for being prejudiced in favour of the one-tier system of local government. To my mind, this system brings simplicity to the administration of local affairs and provides a focal point to which citizens can turn. In 1965, when the then Secretary of State set up his working party, a substantial minority of the working party favoured the one-tier system. It is therefore rather regrettable that the White Paper's proposals are not a little more fundamental in character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the principle of re-organisation in Wales goes, there is the complication of the Royal Commission, which has not yet reported, for England and Scotland. As the White Paper points out, there was no need for Wales to be included, first because action in Wales was urgent because of the large number of local authorities lacking the resources to carry out their full functions, and, secondly, it was stated that progress on reorganisation in Wales was well advanced before the Royal Commission was set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 in page 1 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it was apparent that local government in the Principality could be reorganised on lines that would secure its early strengthening."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
This may be so, but the sense of urgency expressed here does not seem to match up with the progress made up to now, or the forecast for the future. The White Paper was presented in July, 1967, and only now are we debating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we have the statement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State two weeks ago to the effect that we are going ahead with the proposals contained in the White Paper, but that we are also awaiting what is said by the Royal Commission when it reports. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. Arthur Pearson) was rather critical of this approach. It seems to be rather a wobbly stance and, if I may say so, it has not exactly what the Prime Minister once described as the 'smack of firm government'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has forgotten about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State believes in these proposals, they should be acted upon with the minimum of delay. In our local authority there is a certain amount of unrest and confusion. Local authorities earmarked for amalgamation should be having urgent consultations with their neighbours. There are many complicated problems to be sorted out. I will give a simple example, based on the subject of rent schemes. The first local authority may have a scheme based on the principle that when income drops below a certain level a lower rent automatically becomes payable. The second local authority may base its rents on a sliding scale of income. A third local authority may have no scheme at all. As I have said, there is need for urgent consultations on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of devolution. Some of our local authorities have obtained certain powers of devolution in education. Others have not. Again, the need for consultation is urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering this whole question of reorganisation we need repeatedly to remind ourselves that people count, and the people most basically affected by this reorganisation will be the staff of the local authorities concerned. For this reason, on 14th March, and again on 8th June, last year, I asked the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
whether, in conjunction with his reorganisation proposals, he would establish a Staffing Commission to ensure the smooth transfer of staff from one local authority to another. I was glad that when the White Paper was published, in July of last year it contained such a proposal. A similar body proved invaluable in London when carrying out reorganisation there. If I may say so, that was essentially an independent body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for staffing the local Commission, I was rather sorry that the Secretary of State did not mention the type of personality it was intended to recruit. To gain the confidence of the people concerned, it would be important for them to have a really good understanding of local government organisation in Wales. There might also be the need to appoint a local government adviser to the Commission, although this would not in any way inhibit a direct approach to the trade unions concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, it must be clearly shown that there will be fair play for all the staff affected. There is no doubt that in London the appointment of this independent body was fully justified by events. The staff were reassured that their interests were being protected, and the Commission was able in many ways to facilitate their smooth transfer. It was also able to act and co-ordinate on many issues, and make recommendations which could form the basis for action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a few comments about the more parochial aspects of the reorganisation. I am glad that it has been decided to retain the three county boroughs of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport. We all regret the alteration in status of Merthyr, but we appreciate the reasons for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend is not aware that not one reason has been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My Iron. Friend will appreciate that this is a matter for him to argue with the Secretary of State, and I am sure that he is well capable of doing that. I am well aware that many greedy eyes are cast upon Newport at present, but it is well able to stand on its own two feet. That is what is important, for efficiency does not automatically increase with size. The independent status of Newport as a county borough has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
accepted, and the next logical step would have been to recommend an extension of its boundary. Some years ago a very regrettable decision was taken that Llanwern should not be incorporated into Newport. One would have thought that now would be an appropriate time to reconsider this matter, because the Spencer works, in particular, has such a close identity with the rest of Newport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend think it a better idea if the boundaries of Newport were extended to include the whole county, and then we would have a proper city region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will bear with me, I can mention something of a similar character, a link up between Cwmbran and Newport. This should be seriously considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend desires to assimilate by breaking into the area of Monmouth. Would it not be wiser to take note of the admonition of my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Anderson), and proceed in thinking on a wider scale rather than thinking upon such a parochial basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not thinking on a parochial basis at all. My hon. Friend knows well that Cwmbran has been a very troublesome entity to him. Joining it with Newport would create a very powerful authority that would do a great deal for the surrounding area. Speaking as a Monmouthshire man, I fully realise its anomalous position. Sometimes someone is pleased that it is in England. My own stock reply is to the effect that this may well be so, but that I was born in Pontllanfraith in the parish of Aberiscoed, England. This to me is a bit of double Dutch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the ancient name of Gwent. It has a simple but historical ring about it. I was born in Monmouthshire, and I have never believed that the effective voice of that county comes from the backwoods of Raglan. My predecessor, the late Mr. Peter Freeman, always referred to the area as Gwent and I am glad that it has now been decided to recognise this fact officially. Another welcome feature too is the proposal to incorporate the Rhymney Valley into Gwent, for the social make-up of this valley—and I am the first Monmouthshire speaker to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
called today—is the same as that of the rest of Monmouthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome certain proposals contained in the White Paper, but I have misgivings about others. Nevertheless, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that these are the best solutions to the local government problem of Wales, these proposals should be implemented with the minimum possible delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Roy Hughes) in his empire building by making out the same case for the vast extension of Cardiff. It is a great pity that the discussions about alteration of boundaries in South Wales tends to degenerate somewhat into takeover bids, either by the county council for the county borough, or the county borough for the county council, because by far the weakest part of the whole of these proposals is the non-change policy that is being adopted for South Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right through this debate today we have been endeavouring to find out the proper criterion for working out the arrangement and rearrangement of local government boundaries. Is it communications? Is it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. William Edwards) was arguing, an economic entity such as North Wales, with its roads running from east to west? Or is it, as the hon. Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) said, something upon good sound rateable value of the area concerned? All these are put to us as bases on which we should form our local government structure. The hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) argued the question of community of interest. The areas had to be identifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been wrong so far in the debate is that we have not heard from right hon. and hon. Friends proposing these reforms of the real criteria they were using. For example I should like one of my hon. Friends to tell us what in Dyfed is the identity of interest between Llanelly and Aberystwyth? If there is no community of interest, how can it be proved that administrative efficiency will be achieved as a result of these two disparate and different areas being merged under one major authority?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
Despite the fact that they have their own district authorities, they are supposed to combine together into one authority. Why is this, and what is the justification for an amalgamation on such a large scale? I am sure that hon. Members who have said there is little community of interest in large local government structures are correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In North Wales and Mid-Wales we have had bold and bloody reform in the merging and marriage of counties, but in South Wales we have had weak and timid response to reform—in fact no reform at all for the main issues of county councils and county boroughs. The only justification for no reform comes in paragraph 13 of the White Paper, where it says that the community pattern in industrial South Wales is very different from that in most other parts of Britain—I am not convinced that it is in local government terms—and also that if it did perform more radically the relationship between county council and county boroughs it would lead to entirely new authorities
	<br><blockquote><p>"… of a kind not hitherto authoritatively recommended for such areas."</p></blockquote>
I thought that reform was to produce new regulations, not to try to find out what has previously been recommended so that it can be followed closely. There should be some radical spirit running through reform, If we are to cause an upheaval, let us do it for something really worth while. The failure to reform a relationship between county councils and county boroughs in South Wales is one of the weakest and most foolish parts of the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) said that he did not think city regions should apply to South Wales. He misunderstands the case for city regions. It does not concern huge conurbations but the relationship between urban and rural areas. We will not need a very large city to have a relationship between that urban core and some of the areas around it. These recommendations show that there is no real investigation or discussion of the mounting evidence that has been poured into the Royal Commission about the need, a variety of departments and services provided by local authorities, for a relationship between urban areas and surrounding rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office does not seem to have been interested in the information provided by colleagues and English departments. For example the Department of Education said in evidence before the Royal Commission on Local Government when talking about the need for new types of education authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The division between town and country, especially between county boroughs and counties, is in many cases quite artificial. The growth in population and in mobility means greater interdependence between town and country …. A situation which causes some tension in the field of further education is that almost all the major establishments are run by the county boroughs while a large proportion of their students come from the adjoining county area. The creation of larger authorities would break down this artificial division between urban and rural areas."</p></blockquote>
That is education. If one reads evidence provided by other Departments to the Royal Commission in England one will find the same theme coming up over and over again. One can see it emerging in Wales itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we be told what democratic authority would supervise the new amalgamated police force for South Wales? At the moment, we are saddled with an inter-county, county borough committee, and anyone who has observed the performance of that committee in trying to set up this amalgamated authority would be horrified at the thought that this was to be the final perpetual basis of democratic authority to govern the new South Wales police authority. But as far as this White Paper goes, there is no alternative, because we are still to have county councils, and county boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend announced last week which planning authorities he had chosen in Wales to assume the new important responsibilities under the town and country planning Acts. He listed five in South Wales, and quite rightly said that there must be collaboration between these authorities in drawing up structure plans. The idea of the town and country planning Acts and of structure plans is anticipating the new reform of local government. In the White Paper on Town and Country Planning the hint was given in saying that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The present development plans are failing to meet current needs. Part of the trouble is that the areas they cover are too small; the plan-making process is based upon local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
government boundaries which divide areas with competing and complementary needs and resources and, indeed, create planning problems by artificially separating town from country at the point where pressure for change is greatest."</p></blockquote>
That situation exists in South Wales. Cardiff is planning a massive expansion of its town centre with nothing like the same regard that it should have to complementary and competing developments in surrounding areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we implemented the White Paper proposal there would not be any elected authority in South Wales to handle the proper type of structure planning that has been anticipated already in the Town and Country Planning Act. Over and over again one finds that in almost every department in which local authority services will supposedly be made more efficient, more effective, cover wider areas whether it be railway services or child welfare services—no account has been taken of structure planning. There is the child, for instance, who might be handicapped by living a mile or so outside the city boundary and having to go through a whole variety of different authorities which would be unnecessary if there were there one good authority embracing an area wider than the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to grasp the nettle of real reform by reforming boundaries to make our local government much more efficient, why are we not making South Wales local authorities more efficient? Why are we shirking the responsibility of tackling the main problem, which is the relationship between county borough and county council? This division is artificial; it is out of date and archaic. It will clearly be the big recommendation of the Royal Commission, and I assume that is why we have been waiting for it. But it would have been wonderful if we in Wales could have shown that we, too, are up to date in our thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By putting into operation these proposals we would create massive county authorities bringing together authorities which have little or no community of interest, bringing together areas which would not improve administrative efficiency. At the same time, in South Wales, where reform is desperately needed, we would not reform anything at all. This is not what we would call radical reform in local government or
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
government of any sort. We seem to have thrown out of the window the idea of having a properly elected regional council, and if we have done that we should certainly ensure that reform at county council and county borough level is made more efficient. If we carry on with these proposals, we will fall between two stools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very impressed by the closing remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. William Edwards). In his desire to look at the whole question of strengthening Wales as an economically and nationally viable unit, I could discern quite a contrast between his remarks and those of the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) this morning in his dissection of this topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He spent a great deal of time in doing two things. One was to look at a very selective number of other counties which he felt provided a case for very small units of local government. I think that he misunderstood the nature of local government in a number of those counties. What distressed me was that he seemed to be concentrating solely on the concept of a sense of community. This is important as a factor in determining the size of a unit for any administrative purpose, but it is not an overriding factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have on so many occasions heard the hon. Member for Carmarthen speak in terms of performance. He is always interested in how things are working out, and he spends a great deal of his time trying to draw attention—I feel sometimes most inadequately—to what he considers to be deficiencies in Government performance. Today he was not prepared to look at the performance of local authorities. He was not prepared to look into the discussions which have gone in some detail—draft proposals, the Commission on Local Government in Wales and in the White Paper, into the question of consecutiveness and efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are things about which the hon. Gentleman normally speaks when he is attacking, but today he cannot attack by referring to them. Those are the very criteria which have been used here in assessing the organisation of local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
government, so he drops that, and finds some other ground in the sense of community. I feel that he is sometimes tempted against his will to follow lines of argument which he feels will be to the detriment of the present Government. In some ways, he is perhaps more concerned to make that point than to look out for what would be of real use to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evaias</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is rightly concerned with efficiency.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I worked very closely with one Welsh rural constituency—not, I grant, in Dyfed or, indeed, in my constituency—where I felt that the staff were excellent and the officers first-class. I was working with the planning department five or six years ago. If the planning officer was away on a conference and the deputy planning officer was not particularly well, or was particularly busy that day, there was no one in the office who could handle any problems of importance. The rest of the office staff consisted of junior draughtsmen. This is the type of case to which I was referring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said this morning—an outrageous thing to which I would not have drawn attention had he not come back on this type of thing—that it would be more efficient to have one clerk handling, part-time, six counties, and racing about from one to the other. We can make some sense of a clerk's handling a large unit if it is his unit, but if it is a case of doing an hour or two here and an hour or two there it becomes the abject nonsense in which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clear up just one little matter? I was not speaking of six counties, of course, but of six neighbouring councils, which is a very different thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member sees that one cannot handle six counties, but this does not affect the fact that there is a great deal to be said in terms of effectiveness. Very few counties in Wales
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
would dispute this. There are one or two counties—I think of Merioneth, and maybe of Anglesey—which take this line. None the less it is generally accepted among local authority people in Wales that, although they sometimes dispute the precise terms of amalgamation, amalgamation is needed. The hon. Member for Carmarthen should be prepared to be sensitive to the views of local authorities in Wales on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been urged by one or two speakers to keep to general issues of principle rather than to tie ourselves down to parochial issues. I should like to make one general criticism. It is not a criticism particularly of the recent Ministerial statement or of the White Paper, but a general criticism of our whole approach to local government reorganisation since the war. The fact is that since the war we seem to have been interested in reorganising local government purely in terms of reorganising its boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all remember the sad story of the Local Government Boundaries Commission which was set up shortly after the war to look at boundaries, and which had many interesting ideas outside its terms of reference. The Commission stated that it could not meaningfully say anything about boundaries unless it looked also at the question of the functions and definitions of local government. Because the Commission went outside its own terms of reference, its proposals were neglected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Local Government Commission for Wales was set up. It made a splendid draft set of proposals. By the time it drew up its final proposals something went very wild as the result of the type of discussions which had gone on in Wales during that period. The Commission was hamstrung by the fact that it was merely looking at the question of tidying-up local government to do what it is doing now, but to do it better; to make it more efficient and more effective within its present range of duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very worried about this because since the war we have seen an enormous increase in Government activity. We have seen the setting up of a Welfare State. We have seen the nationalisation of a number of industries. We have a whole range of social and welfare services. This is massive new activity. Where is the work being done? Local government, although we say that it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
important and pay lip service to it, is more important than we are willing to acknowledge. What we have done to local authorities since the war has been to take away from them many of their functions. Many authorities were running their own hospitals and their own commercial enterprises. These they have lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument which would rightly have been used then was that there is an enormous disparity of size, rateable value and resources. In Rutland, a penny rate brings in an excess of £3,000. In Lancashire, a penny rate brings in £300,000. A penny rate in Canterbury would bring in £6,000, whereas a penny rate in Birmingham—they are both county boroughs—would yield £250,000. It made sense to say that although very big authorities could do much in running the Welfare State, very small authorities could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot hand new duties to local authorities. Local authorities are busier than they have ever been before, but within a narrower field of operation. Their biggest responsibility is in education. Counties and county boroughs are under severe Ministerial control here. What has happened is that we have seen a mas sive growth in highly centralised Whitehall and Westminster. Both Government Departments and the Civil Service are becoming grossly overworked. Local authorities have lost many of the functions which they had before the war, and have not taken on any significant new functions since the war. There is a great scale of virile activity largely on a regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remember that during the war we broke up the country into regions. Minis terial Departments operate very largely on Treasury or near-Treasury and regional divisions. We see nationalised industries run in terms of regional boards. The regional hospital services and all these other bodies come either under reasonable Ministerial control or are out on a limb of only semi-responsibility. What we have is a great deal of activity where there are no democratic elections; where we have the appointed board member and the official. I would have been interested in an approach to local government which would have made it meaningful for local government to come in on its higher tier in that direction; into an
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
area where there was no democratic control at all, and no accountability. One cannot ask a Parliamentary Question on day-to-day matters concerning a number of the nationalised industries, because the Minister is not directly responsible for those industries, nor are we.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After general criticism that we have not gone that way, I draw some comfort from the fact that the door is, perhaps, not closed. We look forward to the Report of the Maud Commission, although, quite rightly, people have been disinclined to say what they do or do not know about its likely recommendations. There are grounds for suspecting that something will be said about provincial government in England. If this is so, it would strengthen the case for those of us who are very interested in an elected authority in Wales. I was happy to hear the Secretary of State say, when speaking in Wales recently, "My mind is not closed on the question of a third tier of government. There is all the advantage in the world to be gained from waiting to see what the Maud Commission recommend."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the more local problem of whether North Wales should be divided into two counties or be one. I have always favoured the one county concept. I am prepared to concede that there are arguments for two units, but I am not entirely happy about the way those arguments were presented today. There was the argument that there should be two homogeneous units. I am a little doubtful about this. This is a line which the Conservative Party would no doubt take—and certainly the Welsh Nationalists. They would like to see the Welsh counties of Carmarthen, Merioneth and Anglesey kept apart, with the more anglicised pair left on the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said in terms of a sense of unity within Wales, and North Wales. Here, I return to the argument of the hon. Member for Carmarthen that a sense of community is useful, but there is something wider than just this homogeneous sense or community. Anglesey, Carmarthen and Merioneth have a great deal in common, but they have their poverty in common, too. Flintshire is near the boundary, and is fairly anglicised. Denbighshire is going that way. They will go much further if we keep this line between Gwynedd and Gwent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
The argument about travelling time is rather specious. Councillors often travel to London, sometimes twice a week. They do not need to meet in full council more than once a month, or perhaps once a fortnight. There is a great tendency among local authorities to make most of their committees committees of the whole council. There is no reason why this should be so, and travelling is not an insurmountable ditch. After all, Cornwall is pretty well the size of the whole of North Wales. There would be as much travelling in Cornwall now as there would be if the whole of North Wales were one county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a recent meeting in North Wales, when the Secretary of State was speaking on this theme, a rather colourful character from the audience referred to the fact that he knew the Minister of State had always favoured two counties in North Wales, and it was his opinion that the Secretary of State had been not whitewashed but Eirene White-washed. The Secretary of State made it clear that the Minister had kept out of this decision entirely, and that I fully accept. Indeed, if I were to pursue this line further, I might say that he had been Birched as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong if the idea went abroad that Ministers used office for their personal constituency interest. There were those who insinuated that because my predecessor represented a constituency that wanted one county he might have been influenced by it. It is a monstrous suggestion—monstrous to my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White). We looked at this from the interests of North Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This I fully accept, and the Secretary of State knows it. I quite understand that the Minister kept out of these discussions, very properly, since she did have rather strong views. I noticed how amused the Secretary of State himself was by that story, and he has repeated it in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something seems to have gone wrong today on the scoring of opinion in North Wales counties. I have been doing some telephoning this afternoon. As I see it, Denbigh is clearly in favour of one
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
county. Carnarvonshire is clearly in favour of two. Flintshire is clearly in favour of two. Anglesey would have liked to have been left on its own, but last week passed a motion saying quite clearly that it was disappointed that there was not to be one county in North Wales. Merioneth has not committed itself. The scoring, therefore, is 2–2, with on abstention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that when Anglesey County Council last considered the situation it discussed the White Paper as it was drafted, and as it affected itself? There was not a debate as between two counties and one county. They were discussing the implications of a one-county proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies) also bear in mind that it is not only county councils that are concerned. There are other democratic bodies representing the people of North Wales, and the general view of all of them was overwhelmingly against one county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hudson Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to concede that there are two fields of opinion. But as for the counties, it ought to be made clear that the score is now 2–2, with one abstention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are settling for two counties in North Wales, the boundary between the two will be that existing between Caernarvonshire and Denbighshire, unless alterations can be made. That is an anomalous boundary. For instance, the parish of Mynach, although in Caernarvonshire, is on the Denbighshire side of the river. This is because Edward I had to find some land on which to build his castle in Conway. He took abbey land in Conway for land up the river. But because most of the abbey land was in Caernarvonshire, even though he gave them land across the river in Denbighshire, that then became Denbighshire, and that was reinforced in the Statute of 1284.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A must wilder historical accident is the fact that Llandudno and the Crwyddn Peninsula, which is the other side of the River Conway, has also, since 1284, been in Caernarvonshire. The Bishop of Bangor christened the son of Edward I, and was given as a fee a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
piece of royal land. This was the Crwyddn Peninsula, and Llandudno was eventually built on this land. So we have Llandudno in Caernarvonshire, and in Denbighshire—but both on the same side of the river—Colwyn Bay, both of which towns have now grown virtually into one large town. I am very concerned that when we speak about economies of size we may be running a county boundary through the middle of an urban area. The lower Conway Valley—Conway, Llandudno, Llandudno Junction, Colwyn Bay—has a total population, with the surrounding areas, of 75,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will look very carefully at this question. I do not know if there is a way around this. Caernarvonshire would not be happy to lose the rateable value of Llandudno, and Clwyd would not be happy to lose the rateable value of Colwyn Bay. Perhaps, if we are to treat that one equitably, we ought to look again at whether we are doing the right thing in dividing north Wales into two counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Ednyfed Hudson Davies), find it difficult to understand why, as an act of policy, the Government should create a relatively impoverished authority. Certainly, there are special circumstances in mid-Wales, and one can well understand why they were forced to the conclusion there that they should have a very weak authority; but why it should be so in North Wales, I do not know. If they are to split the North Wales authority, I cannot see why they could not have applied similar reasoning to district six, in Gwent, where, again, there is a very marked split between the industrialised South and the agricultural North and very little community of interest between the two. I am sceptical about the case which has been put forward for district six in Gwent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My starting point—and I think that it is the starting point of most hon. Members on this side—is that it is much easier to work up a majority against any proposition than to work up a majority in favour. We can all put forward our individual plans—the Jones plan, the Anderson plan and the Edwards plan; they would not have a majority. At the
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
very least, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his team at the Welsh Office should be given credit for grasping this nettle now and putting forward these proposals bravely, as they have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might begin briefly with one or two points of detail, I do not like the name Gwent. I should have thought that the onus was on the person wanting to make a change to make the case. I cannot see that any case has been made. If the Government were to be consistent in putting forward the name Gwent, I see no reason why they have retained the name of Glamorgan; why we cannot have Morgannwg as well, to have a more tidy operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome, however, the recognition now that Monmouthshire is fundamentally a Welsh county. I assume that this will have certain implications for the law circuit and that these will be worked out in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the Staff Commission, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will make special efforts to protect the officers of those authorities which have been split—like the Magor and St. Mellons R.D.C., for example—who might otherwise find themselves at a disadvantage with the officers of those authorities whose whole authority is to be amalgamated with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the thorny problem of representation at the district level and the number of representatives that a particular urban authority is to have, I should like to know who decides and when we may expect a decision on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, in these initial points, the Secretary of State was unable to tell us today when the legislation would be presented to Parliament, but I hope that when the legislation does come before Parliament, we can have an experiment in the House and that, instead of the Bill going to the whole House for Committee discussion, it might come to this Committee of Welsh Members, who are most qualified to discuss it. On an all-Wales Bill, that would be a very appropriate experiment in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, do the Government agree that by creating these larger authorities, there is a very real danger of limiting the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
already small field of local government candidates, now so often confined to retired workers or workers from public authorities and businessmen? Public transport in the rural areas, as we all know, is often inadequate. With the new responsibilities, we should seriously consider paying the local councillors who will have the new responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that I find most distressing about individual ratepayers, particularly on the Monmouthshire County Council, is that they are simply little local muck-rakers, trying to bring the local government representatives into disrepute, saying that they are in it for what they can get when, in fact, many representatives on local government are making a real sacrifice financially. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) has pointed out to me the particular sacrifice which so often is made, for example, by miners on the county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Finch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that miners, steelworkers and others who are serving on local authorities are now, under the schemes which are in operation, losing a pension of 25s. or 30s. a week as a result of serving on the local authority or the county council? This should be remedied, otherwise we will not get people to serve on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with that most helpful contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My most basic criticism relates to the proposed structure in South Wales. The Government say that they are laying the foundations of the structure for decades to come in Wales, yet we all surely recognise that the nominated council is an interim measure. I understand the reasons why the Government must make it an interim measure at this stage, but this will not last for a very long time; I certainly accept it on this basis. I think that the biggest weakness is in South Wales, where the Government have been not bold enough in accepting the concept of the city region. The only argument that I have heard advanced against having a series of city regions in South Wales is that it would be inappropriate to have one type of authority in Mid-Wales and North Wales and a different type of authority in South Wales. Of course, there are no cities in
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
Mid-Wales, and so one could not have city regions there, but I see no objection in principle to having a pattern which is appropriate to South Wales, and a pattern which is appropriate to Mid-Wales and to North Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the map with which we have been supplied, three obvious city regions stand out clearly—first, a Swansea region, which would, I think, cover the whole of west Glamorgan, the Porthcawl and Neath area; a Cardiff city region, which would cover the rest of Glamorgan; and a Newport city region, which would include Newport and Monmouthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I take up the point which has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Roy Hughes). This is by no means empire-building. If he wishes to sell this as Newport, swallowing up the County of Gwent or the County of Monmouthshire, it is quite immaterial to me; it is the end I want. I think that the case is overwhelming for Newport and the county to join together; I do not talk of absorption by either one or the other. I think that the 	<i>prima facie</i> case has been made, particularly in the evidence given by the Monmouthshire County Council to the Welsh Office, and, so far, no answer has been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Newport, the interdependence with the county has already been shown in the joint administration of, for example, the police force, the joint technical college, the joint remand home, the blind workshops and the joint probation committee. What really convinced me was that during this past month, for the first time, the Monmouthshire Federation of Labour Parties has joined with the Newport Labour Party in a joint grouping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want my hon. Friend to misrepresent my position, because I have not advocated a merger of Newport County Borough and Monmouthshire. I merely advocated a smaller extension of Newport County Borough boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend did not do that; I only wish he had. That is the point that I am trying to make. I am confident that this would save money and avoid duplication. No other authority—a Newport-Cwmbran set-up, for example—would be viable or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
would overcome the real objections that have been raised. I think that there should be one authority for education, for town and country planning, for highways, for health, for fire services, and for children. It is surely nonsense that separate development plans are now prepared for these two obviously interdependent units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deployed the case for Newport and Monmouthshire because I know it best. I am sure that there is an equally good case for Cardiff and Swansea. For the city regions, the functions could be broadly the same as for the new super-counties; the structure could be basically the same with districts beneath it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would take up a point made by the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) with, I hope, really lively ward councils and common councils where all members of the ward or the community could join together and meet their particular councillor. The thing that will make it more real is the new consensus which is emerging in Britain about the city region which, I am confident, will find expression in the Maud Commission Report. Here we have areas in South Wales which are ideally appropriate for the sort of problems which that Commission has been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 say that there is an overwhelming case for the city regions which has not yet been answered, but I would not be so naive as to imagine that when my hon. Friend the Under Secretary replies to the debate he will say that he has been so convinced by my case that he has changed his mind. What I would like him to do is to say that the Government still have an open mind on this and that when the Maud Report comes along, and after further consideration, they will still be sufficiently open to implement this case within the foreseeable future. Otherwise I am confident that it would be a wasted opportunity and we would not be doing what we claim to be doing—that is, building a structure appropriate to Wales which will last for several decades to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for rising at this late hour, but there are one or two points that I should make. I will not give you, Mr. Probert, or the Committee the full speech which I had prepared, I will merely cut it as short as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
The White Paper, in paragraph 14, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider that this kind of evolutionary reform is appropriate to Wales at the present time."</p></blockquote>
I can understand why an evolutionary reform is attractive to my right hon. Friend after the warning he received this morning that if he was too revolutionary he might find himself with a ten-year exile. This thesis of evolutionary reform is the thesis on which the White Paper is based. It is a thesis which is asserted many times in the White Paper, but it is my belief that it is a thesis which is not proved in the White Paper. I would have preferred that if we had considered reorganisation of local government based upon all-purpose authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper contains arguments or statements against all-purpose authorities which are certainly not convincing, because the arguments for all-purpose authorities, although there is a brief summary of them in paragraph 12, are not adequately expressed if the White Paper is to be a fair basis for a reasoned discussion on local government reform in Wales. I will not develop the theme of all-purpose authorities at this juncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced, however, that it would be foreign for us, despite the views of many of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins), to proceed at any great haste at the moment with the reform of local government in Wales without, at least, seeing the Report of the Royal Commission. I give this as an example. If we were to assume that the Royal Commission for England made certain recommendations—if it recommended that the all-purpose authority should be the basis of local government reform in England—what a paradoxical position it would be for us as Members of Parliament. On one day when we were discussing England, we would be saying that the tier system was the best system of local government reform and we would vote for that. On the following day, when we were discussing Wales, we would say that the all-purpose system was the best system of local government and we would vote for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is inconsistency in this. I hope that my right hon. Friend will do what he suggested this morning and not take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
a hard and fast line on this. I also hope that he will delay taking any irrevocable steps, at least until we have the benefit of seeing the Report of the Royal Commission on the functions of local government—and the functions of local government are probably the most important issue. I believe that these functions are exercised by authorities which are too remote from the people they serve. This in itself can be anti-democratic and can bring the whole system of local government into disrepute. My right hon. Friend this morning said that county councils and their associations oppose the transfer of powers to district councils, and that district councils and their associations argue for the widest extension of their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is quite natural, and something that we would expect. But it is equally important to us to appreciate that these views all have in them an element of vested interest. I note the point in my right hon. Friend's letter that the functions are to be the subject of further discussion, but what is the point of these discussions if neither side is prepared to yield from its fixed position? The county councils are reluctant to give up their powers and the district councils are equally determined to get them. It would appear that my right hon. Friend would be called in to arbitrate, or to be, in effect, the dictator—with the possible consequences of the ten years' exile to which the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Padley) referred this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions involved are so important that they should have been spelled out in far greater detail before asking local authorities, or the House, to accept any new local government boundary proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main purpose in speaking today is to explain the position of my own area. At present the Rhondda Borough Council exercises as wide a range of functions as any county district in the country. It is responsible for education, health and welfare, libraries, care of the aged, weights and measures, food and drugs, and so on. I am sure that nowhere would we find those functions being exercised more efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the only criterion, but it is important. For instance there are four Members of this Committee whose educa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
tion was provided by the Borough of Rhondda. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State visited Rhondda to open a day centre for the care of the aged, he said, in effect, that he wished that every authority in Wales would come to the borough to see how these functions were being carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has the White Paper to offer Rhondda in respect of administration functions? It says that for the interim period they may continue to operate these functions as they are now, but that the future situation is not clear. Discussions will go on, and then a decision will be made. In other words, these authorities are not told what functions they will eventually carry out. It is folly to provide that functions which now enable the more personal and consumer type of services to be administered shall be taken away from the authorities which are closest to the people which they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, East (Mr. G. Elfed Davies) said this morning, especially on the financial provisions. In answer to a Question which I asked on 28th November the Minister of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the principal objectives of the reorganisation of Welsh local government is to distinguish, at both county and district level, areas of adequate resources."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th November, 1968; Vol. 774, c. 704–5.]</p></blockquote>
I want to focus attention on the words "adequate resources", and to explain how the proposals in the White Paper affect Rhondda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rhonnda is to be added to a small portion of North Llantrisant making Glamorgan District Five. We have a population of 112,000—the second highest population of any district council in Wales. Its density, of 3–62 per acre, will be higher than that of any district council in Wales. Its rateable value per head of population—£165—will be the lowest rateable value, per head of population, of all district councils in Wales. Because of colliery closures, Rhondda has lost more than £60,000 in the past five years. The recent decision to close the National Colliery will cost £10,000 in rateable value alone. Fortunately, the closing of collieries has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
nearly come to an end, because we have run out of collieries which can be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rateable value per head of population is a fair yardstick for measuring the true wealth or poverty of an area. The argument will be put forward that this is made up in rate resources grant, but I ask whether anyone in this Committee can give a categorical assurance to the people of Rhondda that the present levels of the rate resources grant will continue. No one can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheet anchor for local government finance must, for a very long time, be the rateable value per head of population. This makes Rhondda the poorest area in Wales, and makes it impossible for Rhondda to implement the declared objectives of the White Paper. Rhondda has a motto: "Hwy clod na golud"—or, "Fame outlasts wealth". In many ways we have suffered from too much fame and far too little wealth. The Government have an obligation to ensure that Rhondda is provided with sufficient financial resources to enable it to carry out local government efficiently, in accordance with the best of our traditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans) in his travels through South America, Switzerland and Scandinavia. I want to make no claims for Newport to come into the Rhymney Valley or even for my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. Arthur Pearson) to return the rich, rateable areas of the Caerphilly constituency which have been transferred to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make only two points. The first concerns the nature of local government itself, particularly as it applies to Wales. The yardstick by which we ought to measure local government is the service which it provides to ordinary people. So long as local government units in Wales provide widely differing standards of service to the populations in their areas we are in need of local government reform. Standards vary so greatly from
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
area to area that no equation can be arrived at as between what one citizen gets and what another gets. Until we can guarantee equality of service to all citizens in the country we have not achieved democracy, and our local government is in need of reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, those who have been in local government for some time know how necessary it is for local government machinery to be overhauled to meet the demands of modern society and to do the job which it will be called upon to do in the technological Industrial Revolution which is upon us. In order to do this, there has to be streamlining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been one of the unfortunates on my district council who, in 1947, had to give evidence to Mr. Moelwyn Hughes and the Boundary Commission, I know how long local government reform takes. I am afraid that if this Welsh Grand Committee adduces too fierce an argument against any kind of reform we shall have no reforms whatever, and we shall wait another 21 years before any further move forward takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an open mind about city regions, and other suggestions which have been made, but I can assure my right hon. Friend that public representatives and officers in local government are equally fed up, and are equally anxious to see something done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a letter from the clerk of an urban authority in my constituency, which has a population of 38,000. He makes it clear that since the question of local government has been considered since 1947 it is high time that some action took place. Serious exception is taken to paragraph 23 of the document sent to local authorities by my right hon. Friend, which says that it is neither feasible nor desirable to deal with major boundary anomalies in the new legislation because many chief officers in local government want drastic legislation which will carry out what they have been asking for for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express my sincere thanks to my right hon. Friend for carrying out an imaginative proposal which was forced upon the Boundary Commission by one of my own local authorities—the Gelligaer authority—when, after more years than I care to remember, through the imaginative proposals of the great local government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
reformer, Maerdy Jones, who envisaged multi-purpose authorities in each of the Welsh valleys, we have at last secured the integration of the Rhymney Valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This idea was pioneered by people in my constituency. We saw the folly of small local government units exercising functions at the same time that events were creating other bodies with bigger functions. Water boards and sewage boards were growing up because the matters which required to be dealt with were too big for single authorities. It was a matter of no concern to the people in a valley between Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire whether they remained in Glamorgan or went into the new county of Gwent. They wanted the integration of communities in the valley, and I thank my right hon. Friend for seeing to it that this recommendation was included in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Birch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not having been present during the whole of this feast of reason. I have attended the whole of the second course, which was substantial, but it has not stoked me up sufficiently to enable me to speak for more than about five minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Gentlemen have spoken with contempt of the parish pump, and have then taken a pretty firm grasp of the handle of their own. It makes this a rather disjointed debate to follow. I welcome the Secretary of State's Mark II plan. I did not like the Mark I plan. As I said at the time, I did not like the one-county solution for North Wales. The right hon. Gentleman has done me the honour of lifting my exact words in the House of Commons to justify his argument for the change. Speaking in the House sometimes helps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some controversy whether the Secretary of State is right about what people really want in North Wales. He has had 25 meetings, and he ought to know something about it. I suggest that we cannot get the true feeling by simply ringing up the clerks of the county councils. This point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Denbigh (Mr. Geraint Morgan) who is, as always, in his place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An Hon. Member</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has gone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Birch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he always goes. My hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) had not visited the clerk of the county council at Denbigh, but everybody knew that that clerk was a violent partisan, whose views I did not share and which are not shared by many other people. It cannot really be done on the telephone. The hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. William Edwards) was rather rude about Flintshire. He said that it was an awful thing to have a Kelsterton Technical College. I seem to remember that it was conceived, if not started, by the 1945 Labour Government. He ought to be proud of it. So he would have been, had he won his gallant fight to stand for Flintshire in 1964.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the history of the Kelsterton Training College he will find that the conception of the college was not quite so simple. Nor was it the work of any Government. The history of the setting up of that college is rather more freckled than the right hon. Member suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Birch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could hardly have been erected without Government assistance and permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the main point, which many hon. Members have raised, about whether we should wait for the Maud Commission. I have always said that either we would wait or we would say, "To hell with what the Maud Commission says; we will go on with our own plan". Anything between the two is absolutely useless. I was at school with the Chairman of the Maud Commission, so he must be a good man. It was always being said of him that he was all right, provided that one took the smooth with the smooth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State does not know the main lines of the Maud Report, then he has no proper spies in his office and he ought to get some. If he does know the contents of the Report, we are wasting our time and it would be much more sensible for us to go on with this and be damned to the Maud Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that in some areas there is a desire to tidy up the boundaries of district councils. I am not against the amalgamation of the district councils, but in the past the question of their boundaries has been decided by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
county council, not by the central Government. There will be cases where tidying up operations will be necessary, and those should be left to the county councils and not reserved for the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will, of course, be interested in what is to happen to the rates, but that is a large subject and I shall not touch upon it now. I would simply say that we should get on with the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ifor Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the right hon. Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) I am sure that the Committee would be very disappointed if I did not speak for more than five minutes. I realise that the hour is late, but it would be discourteous on my part, having regard to the very serious questions which I have been asked, not to give the serious answers that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the longest Welsh Grand Committee which we have had in its history and in view of the serious nature of the debate, and, indeed, the importance of the subject, which will affect the whole of Wales, I believe its length to have been justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a very close-packed, wide-ranging discussion. I cannot hope to do more than answer a proportion of the serious questions which I have been asked. At the outset, I would assure the Committee that everything that has been discussed here today had already been discussed at great length at meetings which we have had with local authorities. Someone once said that Parliament is the lengthened shadow of a nation. Today, we have had the lengthened shadow of the local authorities put before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised fall into two main groups. I would like first to comment on the interjection by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) as it was a matter of some importance. He made a serious charge that we were rushing in and that a more profound study should be made by those who know. I would like to tell the Committee that no matter has received a greater extent of joint consultation in Wales than this issue of the reform of local government. The right hon. Member for Flint, West referred to a figure
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
of 25 meetings, at which this subject has been discussed in depth and in detail. We can take pride in the fact that in this exercise of joint consultation we have gone to a great deal of trouble to arrive at the discussion in depth which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery called for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned that the points raised fall into two main groups: first, the general issues applicable to all or large parts of Wales; and secondly, the issues raised in relation to the particular areas. These are the two themes. I shall try to deal first with general issues. Apart from meetings, we have had a number of written representations, which have given us a feel of how the local authorities are thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) asked me a number of questions. He asked why we did not discuss the White Paper before. It was certainly not because we regard it as a comparatively unimportant matter. On the contrary, it is because we regard it as of such importance that we considered that it would make a much more useful debate if we could first review the comments of the local authorities and their associations and decide whether to modify the proposals in the White Paper, and then to announce the results of the review. The purpose of the announcement which has been made was mainly to set some guide-lines within which subsequent discussion in Parliament, and, indeed, with local authorities and their associations, could take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guide-lines covered three main issues first, the basic structure—the continuance of county boroughs, administrative counties and districts and parishes; secondly, the geographical areas of the new districts and the counties; thirdly, the timing of the operation. We know that local authorities and their staffs are concerned about the lack of certainty. The Committee will see that my right hon. Friend has said as much as he could in the circumstances, in an excellent opening speech which was most comprehensive and in which he dealt in advance with many of the subjects which have since been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought it sensible to try to set these guidelines—to put our cards on the table—before we had the debate. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
quality of the discussion that we have had today, over five hours, is an indication that we were right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have noted carefully all the points made in Committee, and we shall take account of them in discussions with local authorities, in the preparation of the instructions on which a Bill would be based, and in the administrative action necessary before and after the Bill is going through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the timing of the reorganisation, and to the most contentious issue to have emerged from the debate: should Welsh local government be recognised separately from English local government, from the point of view of timing, and should the reorganisation in Wales take a different form from that in England? When is the right time to make changes? When is the right time for reform? Any reform, introduced at any time in history, has been confronted with tremendous opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When is the right time? We were reminded this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Padley) that it was once said by the former Member for Ebbw Vale that any Minister attempting to reform local government would have to be a very strong Minister, who would then go into the wilderness to hide away from the criticism. There is a clear division of views in this Committee. Some say, "Wait for Maud". Some say—as did the hon. Member for Hereford, supported by the right hon. Member for Flint, West—"Get on with the job". Others say, "Wait for Buchanan". There has been a strong difference of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities have asked why we should bother to wait. Others have said that we should press on, so that reorganisation may take place as quickly as possible, and so end uncertainty. This point was made strongly in the conference that we had. I received an apology from the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, who suggested that we should discuss these things "with the people who know". The people who know best about local government are the people working in it—people with knowledge and experience. It has been very heartening to hear them say to us, time after lime, that they would like us to get on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
Others have said "Wait and see. The Royal Commission has been considering the same problems in England as have arisen in Wales." The arguments put to the Commission in favour of one kind of organisation or another are the same as those advanced in the comments on the White Paper. The Commission's judgments on those arguments must plainly be relevant to consideration of the reorganisation of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend said very clearly in his opening remarks that in our judgment it would be unwise, at this time, to commit ourselves irrevocably to the proposition either that Wales must be reorganised on the same basis as England or that the two systems must necessarily be substantially different. The existing state of local government in Wales is substantially different from that in England, mainly because there is a larger proportion of small authorities. More than half the English county councils serve populations exceeding 400,000 people. Only one of the 13 Welsh administrative counties has a population exceeding that figure. Seventy-one per cent. of Welsh non-county boroughs, urban districts, and rural districts have populations below 15,000. The corresponding figure for England is 44 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The large proportion of very small local authorities in Wales was one of the main reasons why paragraph 2 of the White Paper stressed the need for early action in Wales, separate from that in England. It may be asked why, if the need for reorganisation is so urgent, the Government do not commit themselves to legislation at a certain time. The answer is that they cannot. Throughout our discussions with local authorities and their associations my hon. Friends and I were at some pains to make it clear, first, that we could not say when it would be possible to introduce legislation and, secondly, that the earliest Session in which legislation would be possible would be 1969–70. That is still the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still regard reform as an urgent matter. I emphasise that point. Reference has been made to the urgency mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) when he was Secretary of State. He was criticised for urgency. This is not an academic exercise. I am glad that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Member for Ogmore, supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Roy Hughes) and many other Members, stressed its urgency. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) also asked us to pursue this matter urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well to say that this matter is urgent. Most of us agree that it is. But could not the hon. Gentleman go a little further in quoting the White Paper, which says that the earliest time that any legislation could be produced would be 1969–70? There is nothing definite about this. To say that the earliest time is 1969–70 is just the same as saying 1979–80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member listens to my succeeding remarks he will have the answer. I have a wide brief and I wish to cover it in a reasonable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We aim at completing the further consulations with local authority associations as quick as we can, but it would be wrong to give anyone the idea that legislation in 1969–70 is practically certain. Quite apart from the constitutional objections, to prophesy that a Bill will be passed in a given Session of Parliament is not possible, because there are far too many unknowns. In this situation, therefore, it would be wrong for us to give the impression that legislation in any one year can be taken as certain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some confusion has been caused by my hon. Friend's reference to waiting for the proposals of the Maud Commission. Can he tell the House whether the instructions to Parliamentary draftsmen will be sent straight away, or whether he will wait for the decision on the Maud Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will wait he will see that I shall explain that as I proceed with my speech. I propose to give serious answers to the questions which I have been asked. I regret that we are so late, but I shall attempt to do it. If we took this decision, local authorities and their staffs individually and collectively would be bound to make their preparations accordingly
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
and if legislation was not passed and the timetable of reorganisation had to be scrapped, the resulting confusion might be enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot, therefore, put local government in Wales to these risks. Where one does not know for certain, one should say so rather than venture on rash prophecies which may seriously mislead thousands of devoted people involved in the local government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, should be our attitude to the Royal Commission on Local Government in England? It is expected to report early in the New Year. Whatever it recommends is bound to have a relevance to reorganisation in Wales and, as has been indicated earlier, there are marked differences between England and Wales, from the point of view of the size of local authorities as well as other differences. But English and Welsh authorities work within the same legal frame, providing the same services, employing the same kind of staff and facing similar problems. We cannot possibly undertake to disregard what the Royal Commission will have to say. To do so would be the height of folly. Moreover, the local authority associations and the individual local authorities are certain to want to consider the White Paper in the light of the Royal Commission's recommendations. They will want to say what they think of both together. It would be unreasonable of us to refuse them the opportunity for so doing. This is the assurance which many hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Anderson), asked me to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I might probe a little further, would that include an alteration even as radical as the creation of city regions, if that were suggested by the Maud Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said that we would consider the recommendations I meant it, whatever the recommendations are. We believe that the proposals in our own White Paper, with relatively minor modifications proposed by my right hon. Friend's statement, are likely to provide the best basis for reorganisation in Wales at the present time. But if the Royal Commission came to a different conclusion for England, those conclusions must not necessarily be applied to Wales.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
It seems neither sensible nor fair, however, to exclude the possibility of reexamining parts of the White Paper proposals in the light of what the Royal Commission may have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to an entirely different point, it has been asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) why there should be a gap of 18 months to two years between the passing of the Bill and the appointed day for the taking over of responsibilities by the new authorities. On the basis of past experience, it has been found that this is a minimum period within which it is reasonable to expect the necessary operations to be carried out. Consider what has to be done. First, the normal local authority services must continue to be provided, with no breaks either before or after the appointed day. We cannot have a situation in which the public suffers because of failure to handle the responsibilities in an orderly fashion. There must be new local authorities in being with existing committee and administrative structures and, most important, with the money to take over from the old ones without a break. I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also asked about the substantial issues which will be dealt with in the Bill. These are consequential matters to be brought to the attention of the executive councils and joint boards. They will be dealt with by Statutory Instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important question, which was asked by the hon. Member for Hereford, concerns the selection of centres by the new local authorities, particularly by the new county councils. This will have to be a matter for the new local authorities themselves, since local knowledge and local wishes are all very important in such decisions. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Member. If the local authorities ask for advice, we shall, of course, do the best we can to provide it; but the decision must be theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would certainly hope that the administrative centres for the new councils would be chosen before the appointed date. Making the choices would be among the first tasks of the new authorities after they had been elected and while they were running in parallel with the existing authorities before the appointed date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
We would hope, however, that for some time before the new councils were elected local authorities would have joined with their neighbours—my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor hinted at this—to lay the groundwork for many of the major decisions, such as these, although the decisions themselves must be for the new councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important matter and I am grateful for the answer that the hon. Gentleman has given to us; I think that it is the right answer. There may, however, be a situation where, in a new authority, a new building has to be built in order to get a central place, and it may take more than two years to get the building on the spot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for that intervention. We realise that this is a real problem but, like many other problems, we will come to it and deal with it when it arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to another important strand in the debate, from the issues of timing to some of the other major points which have ben raised. One major criticism which has been made is that the changes will mean the end of emphasis on local government in Wales. Nothing is further from the truth. This has been said because, if the size of counties and districts increased on the scale proposed, many councillors will have to travel further to meetings and will have to represent larger areas and more electors. Further, it has been suggested that the creation of larger areas will tend to limit the field from which councillors can be recruited, because of the greater demands on their time and the tendency to have meetings during normal working hours rather than in the evenings. These are the criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my past experience as a county councillor, serving perhaps one of the largest populations of any local authority, I am not sure that I can accept the proposition that local democracy necessarily becomes less democratic the greater the number of electors each councillor represents; not necessarily. Be that as it may, the whole point of our proposals is to make local authorities more effective in the tasks that they have to perform, by increasing their resources and enlarging the areas within which they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
The hon. Member for Carmarthen made some comments, with some of which I agreed. He said that communities are essential to the human person. I think that the whole Committee would agree with that, and that there is no greater need than the need for communities to develop. May I say, Mr. Probert, that no Government have given greater attention to the needs to develop communities, especially valley communities, than the present Government. It is because we believe that that we have set up our development districts to attract new industries and new life to these communities and thereby increase the standard of local democracy and local authority. These matters are complementary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I agree with the sentiments upon the need for the community as essential for the human person, I do not accept the hon. Member's criticism that the White Paper is an attack upon local government. I am convinced that this is the way to make service on local authorities attractive, by strengthening the economic life of valleys. There may be many fewer councillors, admittedly, but they will be able to work more effectively for their constituents because of the increased resources at the disposal of these authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How the new local authorities plan their work and what demands they make on the time of members are, obviously, matters of the highest importance for the efficiency of local government and for its attractiveness to elected members. Let us put the right picture on this reform; let us put the correct view that we take of it. The new councils in Wales will have splendid opportunities to look afresh at the structure of committees, the way of presenting issues for members' decisions and the organisation of business generally so as to enable elected members to concentrate on matters which they alone can decide. So the new local authorities themselves will be primarily responsible for the methods which they adopt in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we are talking again of local democracy, let us not forget, either, the proposals in the White Paper for strengthening the third-tier authorities and setting up the equivalent of parish councils in urban areas. Parish councils acknowledge the value of this. They rejoice
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
in the fact that they have not been wiped out of existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a student of his, G. D. H. Cole said that the strength of local democracy really rests in the parishes, near the roots. If democracy means discussion, we have discussion in these smaller communities. This will keep open many opportunities for public service on elected bodies, and if they are properly used public opinion at local levels will have a chance to express itself and to have an impact on the work of district councils and county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn briefly to the other important question, namely, the Staff Commission. I can assure the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Anderson) that as soon as possible we shall be discussing both matters with the local authority associations and the staff association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor asked me how soon, and I reply, "As soon as possible". But there is no intention that the Commission shall be part of the Welsh Office and wholly comprised of civil servants. I can also satisfy the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower), who asked whether a register could be kept in the Welsh Office. We are prepared to consider that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present proposals for the makeup of the new counties and districts arise partly from the work of the Local Government Commission for Wales, partly from the Working Party, assisted by their informal advisers, partly from the conclusions of the Government following the considerations of the Working Party's Report, and partly from what has emerged from consultations with the individual authorities since the White Paper was published. At every stage we have tried to take fully into account local wishes and opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that in some instances local councils—or important sections of local opinion—are unhappy about what has been proposed for their areas, but after carefully weighing all the considerations we have thought it right, in the best interests of local government and the public, to present these proposals. We should be foolish to ignore any fresh considerations that may emerge between now and the introduction of legislation; we should have to consider them and see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
whether they required any changes to be made in our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hereford raised the question of the name Gwent. The Local Government Commission for Wales suggested in its final report that the ancient name of Gwent should be given to the slightly enlarged county that it proposed. As it said, the name is in common usage and we think it right to adopt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was raised about the additional costs of reorganisation. The hon. Member for Hereford and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery both suggested that the costs of local government would go up as a result of reorganisation. They drew comparisons with the amalgamation of police authorities, but we doubt whether thay are strictly comparable. No exercise of the kind which we contemplate in Wales has been carried out in modern times. We can only promise that we shall not forget that one of our objects must be economic local government. If large increases in administrative costs followed reorganisation this object would be defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.

I now turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. S. O. Davies) who spoke very eloquently on a subject very dear to his heart, and a very serious issue, not only to him, but to anybody who is attempting the reform of local government. He asked: where has Merthyr failed? I will answer it. We do not consider that Merthyr has failed. It is not a question of the failure any more than it is a failure of any other local authority which is involved in this report. It is not a condemnation of Merthyr. I ask him to believe me. We have great respect for Merthyr. In fairness to my right hon. Friend, this morning he emphasised that the proposal in the White Paper was not a condemnation in any sense whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Of course, this is important to my constituents and myself. If Merthyr has not failed to carry out its responsibility as an all-purpose authority, why are the Secretary of State for Wales and my hon. Friends messing about with that local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will be patient. I listened to him in silence. I ask him now to listen to me finishing my comment on Merthyr. I will try to cover all his points of anxiety. We are not messing about with Merthyr. We are not messing about with any local authority. It is the wrong word. But my right hon. Friend recognises that the Merthyr council may wish to fight the proposals in the White Paper with all the means in its power. That is its constitutional right, and my right hon. Friend cannot take it amiss, and will not take it amiss, whether it is successful or not, if it uses every fair weapon to defend the present status. I am sure that my hon. Friend will take it from me that the prosperity of Merthyr and the prosperity of the surrounding areas within the administrative county are interlinked and are definitely interdependent. One cannot escape from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of my hon. Friend's argument merely is no reform. My right hon. Friend made no reference to the rates in Merthyr. We are not arguing that Merthyr Tydvil should cease to be a county borough because it has the highest rate of any county borough in the country, and a higher rate than Glamorgan. It is perfectly true, as my hon. Friend said, that because domestic rateable values in Merthyr are so low the average householder there has substantially lower rates than his counterpart elsewhere. He has, for example, only just over half the average in Cardiff. It is a fact that in several neighbouring districts within the administrative county of Glamorgan—many of them could be named—the average ratepayer is paying less than the average in Merthyr Tydvil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend suggested that the citizens of Merthyr Tydvil would lose advantages of direct contact with councillors and officers of their own town. But, under the Government's proposal, Merthyr Tydvil will still have a council, it will still have officers responsible for the wide range of the vital services. He referred to housing—the Merthyr council will still be the housing authority and will be responsible for slum clearance, the development of the town centre, the provision of land for industrial development, clean air, and many other things. I raise my cap to what it has done for housing. It can still go on doing it. As

	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
for the services which would be taken over by the Glamorgan County Council, the town itself would elect members to sit on the Glamorgan Council Council. So the relationship and liaison would still be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the other hot potato—the Rhondda. All hon. Members—I do not see the Member for Rhondda, East here—caught your eye, Mr. Probert, and I feel that you regard it as a matter of some importance. The rateable value per head of population is only one of the criteria which have guided the choice of new districts. The conclusions we have reached about the district structure in East Glamorgan is that the balance of advantage lies in accepting districts of relatively low rateable value per head in the Rhondda and Cynon Valleys, rather than in creating large districts. There is no reason to believe that the proposed districts Nos. 5, 8 and 9 will not be viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative amalgamation put forward by Rhondda is not favoured by any of the district councils concerned. The addition of the northern part of Llantrisant Parish to the existing area of the Borough of Rhondda would not only recognise an existing community of interest between communities like Tonyre-fail with the towns and villages of Rhondda Valleys but would help to revitalise the area. The bigger added area proposed by Rhondda would inevitably give rise to a greater conflict of interest with the citizens of Llantrisant and Pontypridd than would the adoption of the proposals in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figures have been quoted on the 1966–67 basis. They will be out of date very soon. By the time the proposals contained in the White Paper come into operation, there will be many new industries in the Rhondda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main factories in a major development in the area of Llantrisant—the bulk industrial development—is to be transferred to the already wealthier Pontypridd area and the addition of the Mint and the Perkins-Elmer factory would have an insignificant effect on the rateable value of the Rhondda.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that my right hon. Friend cannot confirm that.
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
It has not been mentioned that the Mint will be in this area. Who can say—with the incentives that the Government are giving to Rhondda and elsewhere—that by the time these things develop, the figure that he quoted will not be out of date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor made a point about his area, and I want to touch on it briefly. The question of the southern industrial fringe of Breconshire must be considered as a whole, and we are considering it as a whole. We cannot consider the difficulties of Brynmawr without taking into account their implications for Cefncoed and Hirwaun. We cannot deal separately with Ystradgynlais's relationship with the Swansea valley without recognising the affinity also between Llanelly Hill and the Monmouthshire Valleys. These things are all interrelated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that on grounds of community of interest, economic and social affinity, means of communication and, probably, the wishes of inhabitants, there is a good case for putting the industrial fringe of Breconshire into Glamorgan and Gwent. This is not to say that we do not also see the point of view of the Breconshire County Council, which argues that its industrial areas act as a valuable complement to the more extensive rural part of the county, and that in the east, around Abergavenny, there is as much a case for taking the boundary south as north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paramount consideration has to be the viability of Powys. I emphasise that in this case the chief consideration must be the total resources available to the county administration. The Government recognised in the White Paper that Powys would be poor in total resources but felt that it would be better to accept a unified administration of what is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to one or two other questions that I was asked. I am afraid that I must pass over those Members who are not here. The Committee will appreciate that. I want also to refer briefly to a point raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Birch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not write to the absentees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mrs. Eirene White)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Write to the rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think I will. But I ought to make the point about Cardiff, because it is important. The central point in the issue of the all-purpose authority is that proposals like those of Cardiff and Swansea are totally opposed to the philosophy of the White Paper. This has been explained to the authorities in great detail. The Government made it clear in the White Paper that a programme of amalgamation without fundamental changes was the most suitable remedy for Welsh local government at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the consultation meeting, it was pointed out that the main reason for the Government's proposal was not so much to meet the needs of the large authorities as to remedy the weaknesses arising from a multiplicity of small ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. William Edwards). We understand and appreciate what he said. My right hon. Friend dealt very fully with these points in his opening speech. I wish to reply only to my hon. Friend's comment that the areas in Gwynedd would be subservient to this in Clwyd. I can hardly believe that Caernarvonshire would be subservient to anybody. I think that Caernarvonshire could stand on its own feet, like Merionethshire and Anglesey. I have every confidence that they will work together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In the time I have left, I shall try to cover most of the main points that I wish to raise. The White Paper—"Wales—The Way Ahead"—emphasised that the responsibility for pursuing many of the vital matters discussed in that White Paper lies with local authorities. In that setting, the Government are convinced that their proposals for the reorganisation of Welsh local government, which has been discussed today very fully, will not only strengthen the ability of local authorities to undertake and overcome their great tasks, but also inspire them to respond to the challenge with vigour and great imagination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you put the Question, Mr. Probert, I know that the Committee would like me to express its thanks to you. You have, over a very long Committee, exercised patience, restraint and understanding. We are very grateful to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse those remarks, Mr. Probert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I have to say is that I have an excellent prototype in the Secretary of State for Wales when he was Chairman of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
