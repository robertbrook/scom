	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. George Thomas)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That at the conclusion of this sitting the Committee do meet this day at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
There has been a little misunderstanding, I think, but four o'clock, I believe, would suit the convenience of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. We have been bewildered about the time of the afternoon sitting. We all understood that it was to be at four o'clock. Then circulars were sent round to tell us that it would be at 4.30. Now I understand it is back at four o'clock. May we have some explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the difficulties of the authorities, but the notice given in this case, even had it been correct, was unfortunately far too short. It is not right that hon. Members should have to rely on unofficial channels or chance conversations to know whether and when there is to be a sitting in the afternoon as well as in the morning. Hon. Members have to make their arrangements in advance. For my part, while I knew a long time ago that there was to be a morning sitting, I had no knowledge that there was to be an afternoon sitting until I received a card—an inaccurate card—on Monday morning. I respectfully submit that that is not adequate notice for hon. Members on this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The observations of the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) are noted, but I remind him that the announcement was on the Order Paper of the House of Commons on Tuesday that the question would be put to this Committee that we meet in the afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Statement of Government Proposals for Reorganising Local Government in Wales.</p></blockquote>
As long ago as 31st July, 1939, the late Arthur Jenkins, father of my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exhequer, wrote in the 	<i>Western Mail:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is, I think, obvious that there should be an early and far-reaching re-organisation of local government areas. The old boundaries are no longer suitable; the standards of services in many of them are far below modern requirements, and the parish pump must now be superseded by institutions to designed as to be able to perform their duties with a rate liability on the inhabitants that approximates to the cost of similar services in other districts."</p></blockquote>
Twenty-nine years later, the basic structure of local government and the areas of individual local authorities are both relatively unchanged. Indeed, as far as the administrative counties and county boroughs are concerned, there have been two major changes only since they were first set up in 1888. They were the establishment of the county boroughs of Newport in 1891 and Merthyr Tydfil in 1908. I think that both sides of the Committee will agree that I should have been lacking in my duty as Secretary of State if I now failed to deal with the question of local government reform in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see in this morning's 	<i>Western Mail</i> that the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) promises me "a hot time" on this question. I think that the words are those of the sub-editor. I should not have been surprised if they had been the words of his hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult subject. There are many vested interests which will be distured. No one can hope to provide a plan for local government reform which will please everyone. My over-riding aim is to produce a scheme that will best serve the interests of the Welsh people as a whole. I am tremendously encouraged by the friendly reception which the White Paper has received both among those directly concerned with local government in Wales and in the Welsh Press. No previous scheme of local government reorganisation has gained as wide a measure of acceptance, and this factor, although it is not an over-ruling one, must clearly be a major one for any Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Paragraphs 12–14 of the White Paper deal with the two main alternative forms of re-organisation considered by the Working Party and also by their informal advisers and subsequently by the Government. The first was re-organisation based on all-purpose authorities—that is, a system in which there would be only one main tier of local government and the authorities in this tier would have responsibility for all local government services in their areas other than those which would be done at parish level. This would mean a tier of most-purpose authorities—perhaps about 16 of them—replacing the present county boroughs, counties and county districts and performing their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second main alternative considered by the Government was re-organisation based on a tier structure broadly like the present structure in the administrative counties, enabling those functions that can be carried out by relatively small authorities to be so carried out and those functions that need to be organised over a large area to be so organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two models of re-organisation, with their variants, include all the possibilities which might be applied to the Principality. They have been considered very carefully by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government considered a scheme based on a neighbourhood unit as the basic unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may be satisfied as I go along that such a consideration has been before the Government. We have looked at all these considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility was considered of applying one pattern to one part of Wales and another to the remainder—for example, going over to all-purpose or most-purpose authorities in parts of South Wales and retaining the existing system in the rest of the Principality, or vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's conclusions, however, were that evolutionary reform on the basis of a tier structure was most appropriate to Wales at the present time. There were two main reasons for this. First, in rural Wales, for which my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) and other hon. Members are such doughty advocates, the main county services, notably town and country
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
planning and education, would require such large areas and populations to make them effective that there could be no more than two or three authorities to discharge them. Since on the most-purpose authority basis, these authorities would discharge the district functions as well as the county functions, the reduction in the number of authorities would be very drastic indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->s
Secondly, in South Wales, re-organisation on a one-tier basis would mean abolishing all the present district councils and bringing about the disappearance of some of the largest and most comprehensively equipped county and county borough authorities in the whole Principality; authorities which are already large enough to operate efficient services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, whilst everyone is in favour of local government reform in general, many tend to have reservations when it comes to their own particular area. Before I turn to the main proposals of the White Paper, I hope the Committee will allow me to say a word about the effect of re-organisation on the staffs of local authorities in Wales, since understandably there is anxiety on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me first say that the great majority of local authority employees—teachers, district nurses, midwives, and health visitors, manual workers of all kinds—nearly all those, in fact, who do not work in the actual offices of local authorities—are unlikely to be much affected by re-organisation since their work remains the same whatever the character of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to exaggerate the extent of changes so far as office staff are concerned. There is no question of there being wholesale losses of jobs in the Principality. Obviously there are bound to be some individual problems among the staff of district councils and of the smaller county councils in the fense that some officers may have to move house or travel longer distances than they have been used to do. Some senior officers, too, will certainly have to accept that they will no longer be heads or deputy heads of their departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But against this, I want to stress that the creation of stronger authorities will lead to the better deployment of staff and will undoubtedly provide new career opportunities. The changes may well prove materially advantageous to some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and I doubt whether they will be materially disadvantageous to any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very important safeguard to staff will be the Welsh Staff Commission which we intend to set up by the legislation. My hope is that this Commission will be set up on an informal basis before the legislation is passed and it will certainly be at work long before the appointed date. The Commission will consider and keep under review arrangements for the recruitment and transfer of all local government employees and it will consider such staffing problems arising from the re-organisation as I may refer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman think it appropriate to give instructions to local authorities in the difficult interim period, before the Staff Commission is set up, on their methods and the principles to be employed in recruiting under the present system—that is, before the reorganisation comes into effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend will find that the Staff Commission will be set up in good time to advise local authorities. It will also be charged with advising me of steps needed to safeguard the interests of staff affected by the re-organisation. This body will therefore be a powerful safeguarder of the interests of the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper may well be regarded as both an evolutionary and revolutionary document. It is evolutionary in that it proposes the continuance of the same kinds of local authorities as exist at present—county borough councils, county councils, district councils, parish councils, neighbourhood councils, or something very like them. It is, however, revolutionary in the drastic changes it proposes in the administrative map of Wales—the number of administrative counties will be reduced by more than 50 per cent; there will be 35 districts instead of 164.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Needless to say, the reception it has received has not been uniformly favourable. Some hon. Members will no doubt have come primed with the views of individual authorities or individual local authority associations. But it may help the Committee as a whole if I indicate the broad lines of the views which have been expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The County Councils Association are broadly content with proposals in the White Paper, though they have reservations about the continued separate existence of the county boroughs. Their views are generally shared by county councils representing the majority of the population in Wales—Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, Breconshire, Carmarthenshire, Radnorshire. Other county councils—Pembrokeshire, Montgomeryshire, Cardiganshire—wish to remain as they are, or to become all-purpose authorities or most-purpose authorities. The division of opinion among the North Wales counties has been more complicated. I will deal with it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rural District Councils Association and the Urban District Councils Association have both accepted the principle of the continuance of a tiered system over most of Wales. Their main reservations are over the distribution of functions between the first and second tiers. They, and the Association of Municipal Corporations, but not, it should be noted, the County Councils Association, want functions to be taken from the new county councils and entrusted to the new district councils. This view is shared by many of the existing non-county borough and district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Parish Councils—of which, I believe, my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor is Vice-President—are broadly in agreement with the White Paper as it affects their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only Association fundamentally opposed to the suggestions in the White Paper are the Association of Municipal Corporations. They would prefer reorganisation on the same general basis as they have proposed to the Royal Commission on Local Government in England—an elected provincial council, for the whole of Wales, responsible for a limited number of strategic functions, with a number of local authorities exercising on a uniform basis all the other local authority functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Municipal Corporations suggested 15 areas which might form the bases of these new local authorities, though they made it clear that these were not necessarily the only groupings which would meet their requirements. They would have preferred, therefore, a reform on the lines of the most-purpose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
authority model considered by the Government. There are good reasons why I do not think this is the answer in the particular circumstances of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the four county borough councils in Wales, Merthyr Tydfil have argued eloquently and forcefully that they should remain a county borough. I shall have more to say about them later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So will someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not be surprised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cardiff City Council and Swansea County Borough Council have put forward proposals which amount to making Cardiff and Swansea the centres of much-enlarged local authorities. I have told them that this would be contrary to the principles on which I propose to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I refer to my proposals, I should like to say a word about Merthyr Tydfil. It is entirely natural that the council should be opposed to our proposal that Merthyr Tydfil should become a district and that they should challenge the whole basis on which it was made. I know that I cannot hope to convince my hon. Friend, the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. S. O. Davies) that the proposal has any merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are agreed on that. We are agreed on the fact that I cannot persuade him—and only on that. But I would ask him to believe that this is not just a piece of administrative tidiness. The Government considered very carefully the arguments for maintaining the present position in Merthyr Tydfil—a community for which I have a great effection and esteem—but to concede that Merthyr Tydfil should continue to be an all-purpose authority would make nonsense of one of the basic principles in the White Paper that larger units of administration are required in Wales not only for the district council services but for the county council services as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merthyr Tydfil and some of the smaller county councils have, in effect, challenged this basic principle by arguing that they are strong enough to continue to provide these services. To that I would reply that the weight of qualified opinion—not just Government Departments, but bodies such as the County Councils Association and the Association of Education Committees—is in favour of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
view that a population of the size of Merthyr's 57,000 is too small to support economically the whole range of local government services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would stress that the proposal is not a vote of censure on the Borough Council and their staff; far from it. We have been deeply impressed by the efforts they have made to serve the town. But there is no dishonour in not being a county borough. Towns with substantially larger populations than Merthyr Tydfil have not attained that status, and I doubt whether their citizens would accept that they were any the worse for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend specifically state where Merthyr Tydfil has failed to carry out, comparatively speaking, of course, its full local government responsibilities? That is the only criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be able to tell my hon. Friend that our aim is still further to improve the facilities for the people of Merthyr Tydfil. It is in order that they shall have the advantages of a stronger authority that these proposals are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why will not my right hon. Friend, who has been prattling on this theme for quite a long time, answer my question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot of experience of my hon. Friend and I know that whatever I say he will not consider to be an answer to his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And now for the thorny subject of the structure of local government in North Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have his opportunity, I have no doubt, if he is lucky enough to catch your eye, Mr. Probert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the thorny subject of the structure of local government in North Wales. The White Paper put forward some very good arguments for uniting them in one new county. With its population of over half-a-million it would have constituted a strong unit of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
If the response to this suggestion in the White Paper had been generally favourable, I would have had no hesitation in persisting with it. However, of the five county councils concerned, only the Denbighshire County Council have supported the proposal as it was presented in the White Paper. The Flintshire and Caernarvonshire County Councils are strongly against it. The Anglesey County Council would prefer a five-county merger in North Wales rather than be united with Caernarvonshire and Merioneth alone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would prefer one county rather than merely to be linked with Caernarvonshire and Merioneth. If hon. Members will hold themselves in patience for a moment I am about to say that they would much prefer to be a most-purpose authority. In fact, I know that what they want is to be left alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Merioneth County Council are against the White Paper proposals as they stand. So far as I know, they have not expressed any preference on whether they would regard being united with Anglesey and Caernarvon as the lesser of two evils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter sent to local authorities mentioned the strong practical arguments in favour of having two counties in North Wales rather than one. Most important perhaps is the consideration that two counties would be more convenient to council members, staff and members of the public. It is clear, too, that two counties of sufficient strength to stand on their own could be—can be—centred in North Wales. Moreover, by creating two new counties instead of one we would, as was most strongly represented to me, achieve a far greater measure of homogeneity, It was also strongly argued that the suggestion of one county council instead of five would lead to a far greater reduction in the opportunities for holding office than would the creation of two councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before altering the proposals for North Wales, I considered very carefully all the arguments put forward, including those expressed by the right hon. Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) and the hon. Member for Denbigh (Mr. Geraint Mor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
gan), in the Welsh Day Debate on 15th October of this year. They were views diametrically opposed. It is quite clear that on this, as on other matters, I have no opportunity of pleasing everyone—not that I have ever thought that a very profitable exercise to seek to fulfil—and I know that I cannot please the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend. My conclusion after much anxious thought, was that it would be better for local government in North Wales if there were two counties rather than one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major change which I have made in the White Paper proposals is to withdraw the proposal for a Tiefiside authority, which would combine areas on both sides of the River Teifi, from Cardiganshire, Pembrokeshire, and Carmarthenshire-. Here (again, (there were good arguments for the proposal in the White Paper, but there was strong feeling in Cardiganshire that the integrity of the present county should be retained, even if it had to become the area of a new district council. A county apparently is a county and always will be, with all the virtues for which it is well renowned—and I decided that it would be right to try to meet that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued by a number of individual local authorities of all kinds, as well as by the A.M.C. that it would be better to wait until after the Royal Commission on Local Government in England have reported before reaching decisions on the pattern to adopt in Wales. On the other hand, other local authorities, and indeed the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt), who leads for the Opposition, have urged that re-organisation in Wales should proceed separately from that in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is an issue on which it is sensible at this stage to take a hard-and-fast line. The facts are that it has been impossible to introduce legislation in the present Session, partly because of lack of Parliamentary time and partly because the necessary consultations could not have been completed in time. The Royal Commission's report is, I understand, likely to be published early next year. I have no idea what they will recommend—not officially at any rate, any more than the hon. Member for Hereford who hears the same gossip as I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
But it is possible that some of their recommendations will be relevant to both England and Wales. That being so, it would be foolish, in my opinion, to exclude the possibility of adapting the proposals for Wales to take account of ideas emerging from England. And it would be unfair to debar Welsh local authorities from the opportunity to comment further on the White Paper proposals in the light of what the Royal Commission say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Probert)—he is a very quiet member of this Committee—and the letter to local authorities mentioned that I would shortly be discussing general issues with the local authority associations, including the distribution of responsibilities between the different tiers of local government. The White Paper proposals, in the words of paragraph 29, are essentially for
	<br><blockquote><p>"amalgamating authorities within the existing structure without making greater changes in the present pattern of functions than are required as a result of amalgamation".</p></blockquote>
There are fundamental differences of attitude between local authorities on this issue. As I mentioned earlier, the County Councils Association and the larger county councils are strongly opposed to functions being transferred from county councils to district councils. The district councils, and the associations representing them, quite naturally want the widest possible range of functions to be given to the new district councils, and they have expressed vigorous disapproval of the proposal in paragraph 41 of the White Paper to allocate responsibility for rating to the new county councils. Clearly, this is a matter on which I must have further consultations with the Associations before I make a final announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While appreciating the difficulties with which the right hon. Gentleman is faced, is this not possibly one of the few fields in which any pronounced difference from England would be very inconvenient indeed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making it clear on whose side he will come down. I want to wait until I talk further with the Associations representing local government before I commit myself at all on this question, other than to support the proposals in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Finally, there is the difficult question of the timing of any legislation. I must repeat that I cannot say when it will be possible to introduce legislation. This would not be the simple five-Clause Bill which some people seem to expect. It would be a lengthy and complicated Measure requiring substantial preparations and a substantial allotment of Parliamentary time. It would be quite wrong of me to venture on prophecies, since they cannot at this stage be more than guesses. It is clear, however, that 18 months to two years would have to be allowed between the passing of the Bill and the assumption of responsibility by the new authorities, to allow for elections, the appointment of staff and the other necessary operations which have to be carried out, to permit a smooth transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one relatively simple but very important issue which we intend to tackle in any legislation and which it might be convenient to mention now. Hon. Members will have noticed that in some Acts of Parliament Monmouthshire is included among English counties—for example, in the list of administrative counties in the First Schedule to the Local Government Act, 1933. There are legal and historical reasons for this, with which I need not trouble the Committee. Sufficient to say that we intend to provide that for the purposes of this and any future Act of Parliament "Wales" is to mean the areas of the six new administrative counties, including Monmouthshire under its new name of Gwent, plus the three county boroughs including Newport. That will settle once and for all the question whether Monmouthshire is in Wales or not. It most definitely is and will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Personally I am much in favour of this, but many people in the county would have doubts, either because of the county motto—"Faithful to Both"—or because they want to keep their options open in case the separatists have their way further West. Rather than giving the impression of introducing this by the backdoor, as the critics might say, would my right hon. Friend consider concluding it formally by having some referendum in the county?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had heard every possible proposal for a referendum. I am surprised if the good

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
people of Monmouthshire, with whom I am well acquainted, are not better judges of the political situation in Wales. There is not a dog's chance of the separatists ever getting their way. Monmouthshire can feel secure with the rest of the Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman outlined, or did not outline, a timetable. Does he state categorically that it is the intention of the Government to implement these recommendations during this Parliament, or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are quite clear about this: when the Government are ready, the legislation will be introduced. But I believe that it is of the highest importance that the Welsh local authorities feel that they will have every opportunity for thorough discussions and that we shall not be stampeded into denying local authorities in Wales the right to these further consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to the welcome statement which the right hon. Gentleman made about Monmouthshire, can he say that the term "Wales and Monmouthshire" will now be dropped?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the passing of this legislation. That will be added to the many other things which the present Government have done for Wales. It will be "Wales—full stop."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important matter. It will possibly affect the careers of a large number of people. Does the right hon. Gentlman's answer to me mean that the Government contemplate that this legislation will not be introduced in this Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a date. I made it perfectly clear in the statement which I made that I cannot say when. It will come when everything is ready, and not before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Committee will now express their views frankly on the White Paper and the changes which I have proposed for it. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will bear in mind that I have taken longer because of many interruptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I will study the OFFICIAL REPORT with great care. Time
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
and again in this business I have found myself faced with two opposing cases, each reasonable and powerfully argued, but offering little or no scope for compromise and reconciliation. I hope that all those concerned will at least try to see the other side's point of view, and to accept unpalatable conclusions with a good grace. That is what Wales needs and, I believe, has a right to expect from this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call upon the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt), may I appeal to hon. and right hon. Members present to make brief speeches. I hope to call every Member who wishes to speak, but that will depend on the brevity of the speeches which we hope to hear from now on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Secretary of State has given us a comprehensive and reasonably long speech today upon this vital problem of local government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, first, that my right hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Mr. Birch) is unable to be here this morning but hopes to be with the Committee this afternoon. I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) about the notice for this Committee. Perhaps it would be advantageous to every Member if we could have rather better notice of this Committee, particularly if we are to sit both in the morning and the afternoon, because it affects Members' occupations elsewhere in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad to have this debate today, and glad, too, that it is to be continued this afternoon, so that, as you say, Mr. Probert, every Member, particularly every Member who has a Welsh constituency, may give the Committee the benefit of his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that the Opposition have been asking for this debate for a long time. I hesitate to give the number of times that I have asked the Leader of the House for a debate upon this subject. We particularly wanted this debate because we had been informed that the vital consultations between the Government and the local authorities had been concluded. We were also told in the original Blue Paper of July, 1967, that this for Wales was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
matter of particular urgency. It says it in the introduction; it says it in the summary. Whatever the right hon. Gentleman may say, and whatever his reasons may have been for failing to give an accurate answer to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson), I would say that it is highly unlikely that legislation will be coming forward during the life of this Government. The right hon. Gentleman was right when he said that this was a matter which had to be properly discussed with the local authorities, and we certainly support these further consultations with the local authorities. One does not have to go back, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly did, through the whole history of local government to 1939. The words of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) in our debates in 1958 about special areas and an Amendment of his are well remembered. We also have the Report of the Local Government Commission in 1963.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is on the horns of a dilemma. The need for urgency was expressed time and time again in the Blue Paper, which was produced when his right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) was the Secretary of State. The right hon. Gentleman has to consider that this is a matter of extreme urgency, or he has to recognise, as he has in his speech today, that the report of the Maud Committee, which is to be published early next year, may affect Wales. I hope that he will not regard it as derogatory if I say that to some extent his speech today was a holding operation. Perhaps it had to be—that I will not argue—but, beyond one or two rather small matters, he has not told us anything new. He had the goodness to recognise that the Government have followed the excellent suggestions which the Opposition put forward about North Wales on 21st May, this year, when I propose that there should be two separate counties in North Wales rather than one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes it very easy for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always try to make things easy for the right hon. Gentleman. But what he did not say was that we shall have to try to find another name
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
for the other county. He must bend his mind to the question of finding another name for the other authority in North Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The name Clwyd is suggested, but, with the hon. Gentleman in mind, Dafydd would be a very nice name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that. The right hon. Gentleman will remember a famous Welsh politician who always used to refer to the beautiful vale of Clwyd. It would be a highly suitable name for Flint and Denbigh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are on the subject of names, I question—and this was not asked by the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Anderson)—whether it is necessary to change the name of Monmouth. The right hon. Gentleman himself knows that there is considerable feeling on this subject in the county. If there is any magic in the word Gwent, let us have it, but I doubt whether at present there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the question of capitals for these new authorities is exercising the minds of many counties. The area which I know the best is in central Wales, Powys, and we should very much like to know where the capital of Powys is to be. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor is to be Chairman of the Breconshire County Council in 1969, and I am sure that he of all people will wish to know whether, after the money which the Breconshire ratepayers have spent on beautifying the Breconshire civil centre, it is to be used as the centre, or whether we may have something more central, say in Llandrindod Wells, which I know so well. I shall come in a moment to the problem of the difficulties of local councillors and of their difficulty in getting to council meetings. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to give us some guidance about where the capitals of Clwyd and Gwynedd are to be. After all, the right hon. Gentleman is to have further discussions with the local authorities and this must be one of the main problems which he will discuss with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman faced up very well to the different advice which he had had from different councils in Dyfed. In Pembrokeshire, in particular, on the one hand the county council wishes to remain alone; on the other hand, the district councils and the urban
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
district councils wish the three counties to be amalgamated. What is the right hon. Gentleman to do? To whom is he to listen? This is, I admit, an extremely difficult problem, and I should certainly not be one to pronounce on it until the further discussions have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that the right hon. Gentleman was in a very difficult position with regard to this matter. I believe that there are some basic fears, and that it is right that I should air them this morning, with regard to the whole question of local government reorganisation. We cannot deny that, in spite of the fact that this matter has been discussed time and time again and that so much work has been done on it by various Governments, there are still basic fears about these amalgamations. May I put them very shortly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing we hear is that local government will cease to be local. People have fears about those who are elected to serve these new authorities, because of the great geographical difficulties of so much of rural Wales and because of the expense of getting to these centres. Indeed, we may find that those who represent these areas are either retired people or are the employees of nationalised industries. One must admit that it is easier for both those two categories to attend than for others to leave their place of work. This is a fear which we must try to meet, whichever side of the Committee we are on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that people feel that this new local authority set-up will be more expensive, and here I am afraid I have no good news to give them. I believe that it will be more expensive. If one looks at the experience which one has had with regard to the amalgamations of police authorities in Wales, one cannot say that the cost has gone down. It may well be argued that the efficiency has gone up—that may be so—but let no one in this Committee or in Wales consider that the new set-up, whether it is that proposed under this White Paper or that proposed under any other White Paper, will be cheaper for local government, because I am convinced that it will cost more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point—and this is a point which the right hon. Gentleman rightly
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
made—was this there is pleasure that the county structure has been kept in the amalgamation. In all the original and the previous suggestions, both under our Government and under the present Government, there were suggestions that the counties should be cut up in some small way or another. I believe, and always have believed, that there is a great county loyalty in Wales, and I am very glad that the right hon. Gentleman has come to the conclusion that, whatever the amalgamations may be, the rural county boundaries will be kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fourth point which I should like to make about the feelings of individual people. I believe that there is abroad today, in Wales as much as anywhere else, a feeling that in this country of ours we have too much government. There is a feeling that these new amalgamations may accentuate that situation. In considering these matters we should not overlook it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will be having further discussions with the existing authorities. I am sorry that he has not been able to tell us more about the Maud Commission for England. He said to me, during the course of the debate, that I was privy to the same gossip as that which he heard. I wish I were. If only I could hear what he and his right hon. Friends say in the Cabinet, I might not be a very much wiser man but I should be more capable of deciding this matter. If the right hon. Gentleman has not had an interim report from Maud, he ought to get hold of him, take him down to Cardiff and give him a good tea in the Angel Hotel. Then he should take him across the road and say. "Come into the garden, Maud!" There he should show him the beauties of Cardiff, and learn a little of what is in the mind of the Chairman of this English Commission. I can see little reason for waiting for the English Commission to report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the Maud Commission may recommend city regions, but city regions in England may have a totally different effect from city regions in South Wales. I think that it would be much better for Wales to take the lead in this matter. After all, there is no Welsh representation on the Maud Commission. Why is Wales waiting for this Report which deals with English local government? We should go
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
ahead and as soon as the right hon. Gentleman has had these discussions he should go ahead and tackle this immense job. Because it will be immense, I do not believe that it will take place during the life of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a pity, because a large number of Members of Parliament from Wales sit on the benches opposite. We do not know how long they will sit there in their present numbers—they know as much as I do—but they have a unique opportunity to deal with local government in Wales during the lifetime of the present Government, and I shall be sorry if they do not tackle it as we attempted to tackle it in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Mr. Probert, if I do not like the noises that you have had to listen to. We have had another remarkable speech from the Secretary of State for Wales this morning. Being remarkable, it could be first class, of very high quality, or at the other extreme. Why did he go back to 1939 in his first sentence and quote what the late Mr. Arthur Jenkins, an old friend and a fellow-worker of mine for many years, said about local government when what he said was only an opinion? The Secretary of State for Wales has expressed a thousand opinions about local government, hardly two of them consistent one with the other. To say, as he did this morning, that this was a scheme to help the Welsh people—I am not merely talking about Merthyr Tydfil, angry as I feel about what the Welsh Office threatens to do with my constituency—is sheer nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here the new map of Wales, and I disagree absolutely with the hon. Member for Hereford when he said that he was glad that the county borough and county boundaries had been kept intact. They have not been kept intact. Given a few years of wretched, unconstructive and unprogressive local government as suggested in this scheme, and local government for three of these counties will be dead. I am a Welshman before I am a Merthyr Tydfil man.

I have inherited the sentiment of those who have fought persistently for the good name and the freedom of our own little country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has not my right hon. Friend seen the obvious? This map is the result of the enforced depopulation of rural Wales in particular. If rural Wales had had the attention, without the eloquence, of the present Secretary of State for Wales and other responsible officials, this humiliating map would not have been placed before us this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend passed over with a measure of indifference the fact that the municipal associations of the country are against these schemes. He had better wake up to the fact that it is one of the most powerful and esteemed associations of local authorities. He will learn that sooner or later. The scheme will certainly kill local government in Wales; there can be no gainsaying that. What local government can we have in these vast areas, the local government of which so many of us have been proud? Local government, and Wales has its share, has had a larger content of democracy than anything I know in the life of the country today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the county borough system—I may take Merthyr Tydfil as an example—any member of the electorate and any organisation has access to a local authority almost on his doorstep. Not only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
councillors, but council officials are always available to explain certain problems which crop up, certain misunderstandings which inevitably at times worry people. That, to me, is the real measure of democracy. This silly, absurd exploitation of the neglect of our own country should make the Secretary of State for Wales and all those who have advised him ashamed of themselves. It could have been avoided over the years. Some of us have never been silent about the effect of this colossal and criminal neglect by certain politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I asked my right hon. Friend—and the Committee heard his reply, if one can call it a reply—where or in what respect in terms of local Government Merthyr Tydfil had failed to carry out its responsibilities; he never answered. I once asked a Question in the House on the subject and all my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Ifor Davies) could tell me was that that had been answered by the Commission some years previously. My hon. Friend could never have read what that Commission said about Merthyr Tydfil. It devoted something less than a page to Merthyr Tydfil and did not stipulate a single local governmental responsibility that Merthyr had not carried out in full. Has Merthyr failed in education? In fact it has a better record than anywhere else in Wales of equal size. Merthyr Tydfil established the first fully free grammar school in these islands and has maintained it, and it has turned out more professional people through its spendid schools than any place in Wales of a comparable size.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Brecon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoosen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Monmouthshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We happen to be in a better position than these neglected county areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor knows a great deal about that. These are the fundamental responsibilities of the Minister, not the endless chatter-boxing that we hear from the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any place of comparable size, or comparable population that has Merthyr Tydfil's housing record? Of course there is not. We have four large
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
council housing estates; we have four smaller estates. When my hon. Friend the Member for Gower referred me to the Commission, he was talking about ancient history. Merthyr and Dowlais are being rebuilt and there is no place in Wales of comparable size and population where such a large measure of demolition and construction has taken place. Where in terms of local government has Merthyr failed? I am getting tired of these flippant replies that have no meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merthyr's high rates are made an excuse. This is a pathetic excuse from people who should know better. May I give a few up-to-date facts? The rates paid per head per year, the only criterion I can accept, in Cardiff are £9 14s. 3d., that is 44–5 per cent. higher than in Merthyr Tydfil. Hon. Members can seek their own explanations. The figure for Newport is £9 13s. 2d., which is 44–2 per cent. more. The figure for Swansea, much nearer home, is £2 8s. Od., or 11 per cent. more. Yet we have to listen to this endless sing-song about how high the rates in Merthyr Tydfil are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that without explanation the rate appears to be high. That is unavoidable. Not so very long ago, Merthyr Tydfil had a population greater than those of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea combined. It has meant a monumental legacy of bad housing, bad schools and bad roads problems for us, but we are getting over it. Those houses are now being demolished by the hundred, if not by the thousand. Where in terms of local government has Merthyr Tydfii failed? I could cite other aspects of local government, but I do not wish to take up too much time. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Merthyr Tydfil is deeply involved in this subject, but, as usual, it wants to play a sporting game and see that others have the time they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask my right hon. Friend and those who advise him to have another look at this stupid, irresponsibly destructive plan. I suppose that this Committee will not end before attention is also drawn—and this throws an ominous light on the whole business—to the appointment of a council for Wales the members of which will not be elected or representative. With erratic and untutored brains, the Secretary of State for Wales and his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
advisers are out to destroy local government in Wales. I shall object to their plan as persistently as I can, because I know that it is about the grossest disservice to our country that I have seen since I came to the House of Commons</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. S. O.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be published in HANSARD, but it would not do any hon. Member opposite any good. When the 	<i>Western Mail</i> announced this morning that the Secretary of State was to have a "hot time", apparently from the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt), it must have confused the identity of the Member for Hereford with that of the Member for Merthyr Tydfil, because one thing the Secretary of State did not have this morning was a hot time at the hands of the Member for Hereford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the hon. and learned Member that I am not, never have been, and never hope to become a correspondent of the 	<i>Western Mail</i>? The 	<i>Western Mail</i> did not derive that report from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the hon. Member has a warm regard for the 	<i>Western Mail,</i> though I am not sure whether he said "co-respondent" or correspondent". The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) is anxious that the Government should bring in this legislation during this Parliament, because he clearly does not want to bring it in. What is equally clear is that the Secretary of State for Wales has no intention of introducing it in this Parliament. It is absolutely clear that there is little significance in the debate. We are debating theoretical concepts, because there is not the slightest intention of bringing in a Bill to implement what we are discussing. At least we have gleaned that, though by a process of inference and not directly, from the replies giver by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil that in essence local government must be local, that it must attract the attention and the interest of people in a locality who feel a loyalty to that locality. Democracy, as opposed to carrying out functions—they can be combined, but they are different things—means getting the interest of people to serve. We serve in a national Parliament and we might serve eventually in a Welsh Parliament, but if we want people to serve in local government, unless they are to do it for remuneration, when we will get simply the qualities in response to the remuneration offered, we have to enlist their interest and loyalty. That is where this plan fails, and fails entirely: it is to be neither national nor local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil has a very considerable knowledge of Powys, as I know from my own experience. The people in Brecon and Radnor are very good people, but their paths do not often cross those of the people of Montgomeryshire. There is not a tradition historically of a great deal of intercourse between them, social or otherwise. Although they mix on the borders of Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire, certainly for agricultural purposes, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Tudor Watkins) will agree with me that in fact the lives of the counties run quite separately and have no common historical background. It is difficult to feel, therefore, that in a forced amalgamation of this kind there will be the feeling of loyalty, the feeling of identity, which is necessary if there is to be not efficient local government, but efficient democratic local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is a hope of these plans being brought in for a number of reasons. I shall not enumerate them, but I wonder how the man in the street regards all this planning of local government. There is a great tendency for Governments, particularly the present Government, to build in mid-air, to go for the theoretical rather than the practical. The man in the street is concerned with the kind of service being provided, the people who are to control his environment, the kind of job they will make of it, whether a plan is likely to result in higher rates, the increased cost of living, whether it will cost more, be efficient,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
give his children a better opportunity in life than he had, or whether it is simply building in mid-air, changing various things, but resulting in no better services. Those are the kinds of tests that the man in the street applies to plans of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any possible hope of this plan being implemented at present for a number of reasons. The first is the economic situation of the country. This plan clearly would cost a great deal. The hon. Member for Hereford is absolutely right about that. I have not know yet of an amalgamation of police forces, or local authorities, or anything of the kind, that has not resulted in a great increase in costs. Parkinson's Law works wonders when there are amalgamations. There is the perfectly natural muscling about for increased status, but it all results in a greatly increased cost. At the moment, when most economists say that Government spending is a major factor in the economic problems of the country, how could anyone possibly justify going on with this kind of scheme when it would clearly cost the country a great deal more money and cost the ratepayers of all the amalgamated counties a great deal more money? It is completely "out" on that count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me illustrate this a little further. Some services in Wales are extremely efficient while others leave great room for improvement. Far be it from me to say that there is no room for improvement in local government; there clearly is. Basically, there is more room for improvement at district and urban level than at county level. The Secretary of State knows perfectly well one matter which has been greatly troubling me recently, and troubling him, has been that he has had to turn down 18 rural sewerage schemes in Wales in the past few months. People expect a service of local government. If the Government cannot afford to spend money on an essential service, they certainly cannot afford to spend money on tinkering with the machinery by which it is provided, because what matters to people is the provision of the service, not the machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) was absolutely wrong when he said that this was a matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
of great urgency. Because he took that view, Wales has had the worst of all worlds. We have had a working party of anonymous people, faceless men. They may be extremely able men, and I do not doubt that; nevertheless, they are unknown, save in the footnotes in the reports by their tasks as the heads of various departments, and Professor Ivor Gowan, who is the only named man, at the University of Wales. We have had a series of unknown advisers, but in Wales we have not had a thorough public study of the problems of local government in depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have in this plan is a tinkering with the matter, a tinkering with the boundaries, as though that would solve the problem. Local Government in Wales deserves a far profounder study. It should have been a public study and people should have been allowed to give evidence. I am not privy to the gossip as the right hon. Gentleman is, but I know that there have been consultations, but this was not the right way of going about it. The result is that we have the worst of all worlds. The urgency has gone. We are to wait for the Reports of the Local Government Commissions in England and Scotland. As the problems of Wales are often akin to those of Scotland, we might lean on and learn more from the Scottish Report than the English Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various concepts have to be considered. There is the suggestion of a city area. I am attracted by the idea of most-purpose authorities centred on, for example, Cardiff, Swansea, and possibly mid-Glamorgan. This kind of suggestion should have been studied. To rush in with a plan that simply tinkers with the boundaries and amalgamates authorities before the Report of the Royal Commission has been considered would be quite wrong, and I think the Secretary of State is right to perform a holding operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from St. Dyfed, we have only one city. Is it not the trouble that we cannot very well have "city regions" in a country which has only one city?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong to think that Wales has only one city. I recommend him to learn a little more about the country which he represents. I was using "city" in the sense
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
of a large conurbation—I cited Swansea, whose football team plays under the name of "Swansea Town". Nevertheless, it is a considerable area and would be a suitable centre for a city region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Llanelly went about this the wrong way. There was not the urgency that he suggested. There was certainly no justification for Wales having only a working party while Scotland and England had thorough inquiries into local government at all levels and also a study of functions. The reform of local government depends basically not so much on tinkering with boundaries and amalgamations as on a study of the discharge of functions. This has not been done for Wales as it should have been done. This is an additional reason why it is not possible to implement these plans now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third and important factor. When the working party was set up only a few of us thought, and it was not generally accepted that there might be important constitutional changes. A constitutional Commission has now been set up to inquire into the problems of government in Wales and Scotland, because local government cannot be considered without considering the question of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, we are concerned with government at all levels, and some functions now discharged here may in the future be discharged elsewhere. Certain functions now discharged by county councils might be better discharged nationally. Any reform of government should begin in essence with a study of functions and the report of the constitutional Commission is likely to affect our basic views of the reform of local government in Wales. For example, if there were a domestic Parliament in Wales, or an elected council, it could not be said that the setting up of such a body would not affect our views on the reform of local government in Wales, clearly, it would. Today's debate is therefore best regarded as a holding operation a debate which is part of the discussion that will lead to the reform of government at all levels. It would be a great mistake to implement these reforms piecemeal, and that may be what the Secretary of State has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are very fond of magic words, none more so than the Secretary of State. "Evolutionary" was his magic word this morning. This plan was the touchstone, was evolutionary. I am not sure what exactly that meant and the right hon. Gentleman certainly did not explain it. It is one of those little words that suggest that something is marvellous—" this is evolutionary". The Government have got themselves into a complete muddle on this matter. There was the initial view of the first Secretary of State for Wales that this was an urgent matter that it could not wait for any commissions, that it had to be pushed on. Now the whole process has been reversed, and we have seen it in reverse today. Furthermore, the Government are in such a state that they cannot afford to introduce any reforms of this kind at present. Therefore, this is a rather academic debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the Secretary of State he is not to wait for legislation to set up a staff commision, but will evolve one of his own to give guidance. Presumably it will be evolved within the Welsh Office. As a practical matter, if such a staff commission is to be evolved, it should have representatives of local government from the start, not only the heads of Departments within the Welsh Office, but representatives of local government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much reform of local government is necessary, I am sorry for those local government officers in Wales who have endured a long period of uncertainty which is to be prolonged yet further. Nevertheless, this matter must be carefully considered. I am not at all enamoured of this plan. I would much prefer most-purposes authorities in Wales. I see tha tthe basic principle appears to be that, whatever else happens, Glamorgan must not be touched. If we are to have most-purposes authorities, Glamorgan could well be divided into regions, with great benefit to all concerned. That might solve the problem of Merthyr Tydfil by enlarging its region and enlarging the region of Cardiff and Swansea and so on. In the meantime, I am certain that if the Government have money to spare, it should be spent on providing the services that local government is intended to provide, and not spent on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
superstructures such as we have had suggested today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Padley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the last two speakers, I wish to give determined support to the Secretary of State. This morning we have heard speeches which assumed that, because local government in Wales had not received sufficient public discussion, an investigation by a committee was required. Everyone who knows the history of Wales must know that this has been the subject of countless investigations and prolonged discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I heard the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) say that this was an academic discussion, that my right hon. Friend had no intention of implementing the proposals, and implying that the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) had no intention of implementing them, I was reminded of a meeting in this Committee Room just after the late Aneurin Bevan ceased to be Minister of Health. Under the then arrangements, he had been responsible for local government. He had been holding discussions and he said that he had come to the conclusion that the local government reorganisation would require a strong Minister to impose reform and then go into exile to escape the wrath to come. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be that strong Minister, and I promise my services to organise a regiment of Welch Guards to defend him from the wrath to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger is that today we will hear only criticisms of the proposals, but I agree with the First Secretary of State for Wales, my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths), that this is an urgent matter. In England, Scotland and in Wales local government has become an anachronistic absurdity, totally unsuited to the new industrial revolution through which we are going. Naturally, any reform of local government arouses controversy. Of course there are local traditional rivalries; of course there are vested interests; of course there are different views based on political principles of organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were writing the Padley Plan, I would come down in favour of all-purpose authorities for a considerable part of industrial south Wales and certainly in
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
mid-Glamorgan an amalgamation of Port Talbot and Ogmore would be an idea. But if I am asked whether I am to go into the wilderness to preach that idea, rejecting concrete proposals which have commanded more support than any put up certainly in the 20 years that I have been actively associated with Welsh politics, I will say "No". I prefer to implement these proposals, to let the Secretary of State carry out his promise to discuss functions and the financial problems in the interregnum between now and legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Ogmore constituency which consists of four boroughs, all proud of their records: Maesteg U.D.C., Ogmore and Garw U.D.C., Bridgend U.D.C., and Penybont R.D.C. But from the middle twenties the late Vernon Hartshorn, a member of the first Labour Cabinet, advocated the amalgamation of those four authorities, with or without Porthcawl. Today, we have a proposal before us to amalgamate the four authorities with Porthcawl, and frankly, the fact that Porthcawl Council tends to be rather the blushing young lady who will not say yes and who will not say no, with one view today and another tomorrow, does not worry me. It is a question of with or without Porthcawl as far as I am concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mid-Glamorgan has been, and is scheduled for the future as, a growth point in the new industrial revolution in Wales. When considering the structure of local government, and facing the problems of growth in population, of housing, of water, of sewerage and so on, I would say that the present division of mid-Glamorgan into five authorities is an anachronistic absurdity. I do not believe that we can carry out the work of industrial reconstruction without this kind of reform—and that is my answer to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery when he talks about the cost of amalgamation. What we need to do is to increase the wealth of Wales, to increase the income of Wales. I assure the hon. Gentleman that any costs of amalgamation will be infinitesimal compared with the solid economic advances which this reorganisation can bring about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Here we are, four years later, and it has not happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Padley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that we have all—and when I say "all" I mean all political persuasions in Wales—been talking about it for some 50 years. This is the first set of proposals which has broadly carried support from the representative organisations. The Secretary of State adduced the evidence this morning that that is a statement of fact, and we should be most unwise if between now and the rising of this Committee late this afternoon, we gave the Press and the public the opportunity to say that the Welsh Grand Committee were prepared to turn down proposals which are constructive—proposals which, I am certain, will serve the long-term interests not only of mid-Glamorgan, which I represent, but of the whole of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Donnelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for long and I will address my remarks to three different aspects of this White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it seems to me that we must consider the whole general principle of local government in the United Kingdom. Secondly, perhaps I might say a few words about the detailed proposals. Thirdly, I would add some thoughts about what we ought to be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weakness of the White Paper is that it is produced in a vacuum. It does not consider the whole governmental problem, as one piece, in the United Kingdom. One must start by looking at the whole spectrum. When I first came here, 18 or 20 years ago, I came with a suitable sense or respect for the House of Commons as an institution. Very quickly I realised that it was a most inefficient body. Since last year, when my wife won a seat for the Labour Party in the Pembrokeshire County Council—a month after hon. Gentlemen devalued the £—I have had more frustrations visited into my home on the workings of local government. The basic point is that the whole governmental structure, starting with the House of Lords and ending with the parish councils is out of date for a modern country. We are discussing only one aspect of it here, but we should be thinking of the whole spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
These proposals offer a series of amalgamations of county councils and a wholesale amalgamation of rural districts urban districts and boroughs. Some of these proposals are highly desirable. As the hon. Member for Ogmore (Mr. Padley) rightly said, the local government structure at the moment is totally unsuitable and completely out of date. In my own constituency I represent 12 local authorities who have to find about 300 councillors and aldermen to occupy the local authority seats in one constituency alone. There are not enough people of a suitable calibre with the time available to do the job. It is right that we should deal with these small, local authorities, which are unsuitable vehicles for administration. They are too poor and they do not attract the right quality of staff because they cannot pay them. It is right that all these things should be dealt with. But it is only one part of the whole proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The true weakness of these proposals arises from the question what we are to do about regional government in the United Kingdom. A constitutional Commission is about to be set up. Either the constitutional Commission means something or it is merely a form of fobbing off the hon. and very tame Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Gwynfor Evans). If the constitutional Commission means something, we should be thinking about local government structure in relation to what might be a possible regional Government for Wales. This is where the size of the county councils raises one's doubts. The turning down of the proposal for a single-tier local authority in paragraph 13 makes one wonder whether the Government have given it proper attention, in looking ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in the report references—as the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) said—to the faceless men who gave advice to the Government. The Secretary of State also paid tribute to the Rural District Councils Association and other associations which seemed to be in agreement with this Report. The right hon. Gentleman ought to realise that a number of these local authority associations have a vested interest in perpetuating themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The function of an experienced Minister is to reject the advice which he is given until he is forced to accept it. He is in office partly as a veto of society on behalf of the public. But that is so often not the case with Ministers. After all, this proposal is in effect an advanced form of the old Henry Brooke plan. It has been produced under the name of the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas). I never thought that I should see him in the mantle of Henry Brooke, but here he is with his plan.

Pembrokeshire, were then to be amalgamated with Carmarthen and South Cardiganshire. Now it is to be all of Cardiganshire. But there is very little difference. The difference is marginal. One Cardiganshire man is very little different from another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with these specific proposals, I have some doubts, too, about West Wales, but I should not be putting them forward if I did not think that they were part of the general doubts which I have about the whole scheme as it stands. Take Pembrokeshire. We are being asked to amalgamate with Carmarthen and Cardigan. Basically, our central interest is as an oil port, whereas their interests are to do with the coalfield in Carmarthen and with agriculture in Cardigan. We have an agricultural interest, too, but basically that is the only interest that we have in common with these other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, too, a problem of attracting industrial growth in the area. We shall not be able to attract new industries to that area from other parts of the United Kingdom, or to attract capital investment from abroad if, for instance, our local educational system has an excessive bias towards Welsh. Industrialists will not come to the area. Yet the proposal could well be that Pembrokeshire, with its English tradition in South Pembrokeshire, should be amalgamated with these two predominantly Welsh counties. I am not criticising whether they should be Welsh or net. I am merely stating this as a practical fact of attracting industry. We shall run into immediate difficulties if our educational system is overweighted towards Welsh, as opposed to the situation as it is today in South Pembrokeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the other day I was in Aberystwyth, talking to one of the university professors who is leaving because he does not want his children to be taught Welsh in Cardiganshire. That is the sort of problem that one faces. If we are to have a cosmopolitan community, attracting industry, we have to face the practical realities. There is no way round it. This is another deep concern that exists in Pembrokeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, there is the minor point that we have a different view about drinking on Sundays from that of hon. Gentlemen
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
in other parts of Wales. Are we, with our tourist trade, to go back to a dry Sunday? In my view that would be disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore, these separate lines of demarcation between these local authorities which cause some doubt as to the way in which the boundaries have been drawn and which are bound to lead to deep resentment, certainly in Pembrokeshire. This brings me back to the central thought, that if we are moving towards an elected Parliament for Wales, the question arises whether we want a two-tier structure of local government and whether we want these excessively large county units. Who is to staff all these authorities? Who is to sit on them? Who is to be travelling around Wales doing this work? Who is prepared to find the time to do that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the central answer, which ought to be, in my view, that the Government should mark time and wait until the constitutional Commission has reported. If the constitutional Commission reports in favour of a separate Parliament, modified in one way or another, with new powers, some perhaps delegated from this House, some taken from the county councils to Cardiff, we might well have to consider a single-tier structure of local government as the most suitable form of local government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ogmore referred to Aneurin Bevan and his references to local government reform. Aneurin Bevan sacked the Local Government Boundary Commission because they did not produce a single-tier proposal, and he was basically a single-tier proposal man. I think that he was absolutely right. That is the way in which we shall get a local government with a sense of involvement and with excitement and commitment at grass roots level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, this place is over-cluttered with too many powers and responsibilities. Some must be devolved from here if this place is to be effective. Some powers are better administered regionally, as we are finding only too clearly. The police force is an example and the fire service a possibility. Regional planning, certainly, and main highways and transport arrangements in regions probably, should be regional responsi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
bilities. The health services, in my view, might well be regional responsibilities. Certain aspects of housing, such as the overspill problem of congested areas or the establishment of new towns, should be regional responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that means that the county council structure, such as we are discussing, could easily be out of date overnight if this constitutional Commission reports differently from the structure which some hon. Gentlemen would like. If the Commission came down in favour of the views of the hon. Member for Carmarthen, there would certainly be a considerable radical change, with what effect I am not at all sure—but I dare say the rest of us would be leaving fast, emigrating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nub of the problem is that the proposals which we have might have been all right before we were considering a regional movement in the United Kingdom. They are not all right in the present state of the debate. Certainly something has to be done. I should have thought that the amalgamation of the district councils ought to proceed as speedily as possible, but the county proposals, I think, must be left in abeyance until we have determined our regional policy. I do not see any alternative to that if we are to have effective government in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I commend to hon. Gentlemen a small book which has just been published. It is called "The Devolution of Power", and it is written by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh). I do not think there are many Members of the House of Commons capable of writing a book of this nature. One does not have to agree with every proposal in it to realise that this is a very interesting and stimulating guide to the debate. I am sure that the hon. Member for Carmarthen would certainly not agree with many of its conclusions, nor would the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse)—it would certainly make his hair curl. He is not here today. He is just curling his hair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by reminding hon. Gentlemen of some words used by the hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian at the end of his book. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But the real problem is both intensely practical and a vital matter of theory. The Royal Commissions on Local Government are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
to report in December 1968 or early in 1969. If the Reports are wrong or muddled or timid, or if they are correct and courageous but are not implemented by the Government, it will be a disaster—a disaster not for any vague reasons of theory but because of the damage that will be done if local government is incapable of organizing our economic growth in terms of factories, houses, water supplies and roads, if the motives that underlie Scottish and Welsh nationalism are misunderstood or ignored, and if we are incapable of reaffirming the democratic element in our tradition."</p></blockquote>
The democratic element, I emphasise, means departing from local government as it is today.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The recasting of Britain's local Government system presents as great a challenge as the curent need to readjust to a new European rôle in defence and foreign policy or to restructure the economy to enable it to succeed in a new and competitive trading environment. It is a challenge to take the necessary decisions and carry them through."</p></blockquote>
All these decisions, I submit to the Committee, must be taken as part of a grand design. It is the grand design that is lacking in the discussions which we are having here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Elfed Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In deference to your remarks at the beginning of this Committee, Mr. Probert, I shall endeavour to keep my remarks as brief as I can, as I know that there are many Members who wish to speak. I want to say a few words, first of all, on the general position, and then I shall deal briefly with the failure, as I see it, of the recommendations of the Secretary of State, with particular reference to the part of the Principality which I know best—the constituency which I represent and the districts which surround it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said quite clearly, and I think it is patent, that all connected with local government work in Wales are unanimous in one thing, that there is a need, a need which has been apparent for a very long time, for a radical and far-reaching change in the organisation of the old structure and system of local government in Wales. It is equally true to say that few agree about what this new structure should be, because in no field of activity are there more local and parochial attitudes than in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had some experience of this matter as the Chairman of the Local Government Committee of the Glamorgan County Council prior to coming to
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
this House. At that time we were in negotiation on the question of giving evidence to the Local Boundary Commission. I became convinced that almost everyone we met wanted the status quo. Everyone needed change. it was thought, but no one needed change in themelves. That, I believe, is an attitude which persists. I am fairly satisfied that there is no likelihood whatever of changes being agreed mutually between and by the various authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the late Aneurin Bevan—reference with which I agree entirely. The person who undertakes to do this responsible task would indeed be a courageous and brave man. I have always thought that the Secretary of State was a brave man. I hope that I shall continue to think so after I have finished my few remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overriding consideration of any effective reorganisation must be greatly improved efficiency of local government administration, which must have regard to the interests of the people it is intended to serve. To accomplish successful and effective changes, the new authorities must be made more viable and larger units, authorities which are able to stand upon their own feet, more reliant on their own resources and less upon the need for Government aid in the form of grants. It is my sincere conviction that, in a number of instances, the proposals of the Secretary of State fail to do this. I have not the time today to deal with all the proposals for amalgamations in respect of county councils. In the main, I consider them to be fairly reasonable. I know that there are arguments about having one or two counties in North Wales, but I am sure that these issues will be argued in the Committee later by hon. Members from that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper of July, 1967, "Local Government in Wales", states in paragraph 2 of page 1:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the need for early action is particularly urgent in Wales where a very large number of authorities lack the resources to discharge their functions as fully and effectively as modern conditions increasingly demand."</p></blockquote>
It seems from the Secretary of State's proposals of 21st November, 1968, that there has been some change in that respect and that the Secretary of State does not consider the argument valid at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
present. The urgency it seems, is not now so apparent. In paragraph 3 he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He recognises however that authorities and the associations representing them may wish to express further views in the light of the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England. He is therefore prepared to accept that those local authority associations and individual local authorities who so wish should have a further opportunity to submit in writing their views on the form which the reorganisation should take after they have been able to consider the report of the Royal Commission."</p></blockquote>
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with that contention. I think that it is right. The Secretary of State, in his speech in opening this debate has given reasons why this change has taken place. I do not quarrel with them at all. I believe that it is necessary for us to have some understanding of what is going on and why we should say at one juncture that it is urgent and at another juncture that it is not urgent. One reason is that we are to have in the next few months the report of the Local Government Commission for England. Secondly, the constitutional Commission is to be set up. But we should be very careful about this, because there is always some new body which has been set up which can be used as a reason to delay the organisation of local government. If that is the argument which we always use, there will never be a right time. We ought to take note of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to why I consider that the latest recommendations have failed to create, within the new structure proposed, the viable units which are regarded as necessary for effective local government authorities in Wales. I make no apology for referring, in the few moments I have left, to Rhondda, because it is the largest authority in Wales, apart from the county boroughs. It has a long tradition. I do not want to get into an argument with my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydvil (Mr. S. O. Davies), but Rhondda, too, has a proud and honourable tradition and is entitled to be looked at rather more favourably than has been the case in these proposals. Under the new proposals, Rhondda will still be the lowest local authority in Wales in rateable value per head of population. District 5 of the county of Glamorgan, comprising Rhondda Municipal Borough and the northern part of Llantrisant and
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Llantwit Fardre Rural Districts, will have a rateable value per head of population of £16–50. That will be the position after reorganisation. The next lowest is District 8, which is Aberdare Urban District and Mountain Ash Urban District, which has a rateable value per head of population of £1867. All other districts in Glamorgan are over £22–74. Almost every other district in the whole of Wales is higher than Rhondda, which is the lowest in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is generally accepted that the measure of wealth or poverty of a local authority is its rateable value per head of population. The implementation of the White Paper proposals would increase Rhondda's figure in this respect only marginally from £16–16 to £16–50. I repeat, it would be the lowest of all the new districts under this proposal. With the merging of the southern part of Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre, the figure for Pontypridd would increase from £29–76 to £34–73—more than double that of Rhondda under these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that one other cardinal principle of the White Paper of 1967 has been thrown away for no good reason, and that is the recommendation that, in amalgamations of district or borough councils, present local authorities should not be split up unless that is unavoidable. I contend that there was no need whatever to split Llantwit Fardre. It could have been merged with the Rhondda as one authority. What has been done is to carve up this area, with the northern part—the poorer—going to Rhondda, an already poor authority, and the southern part—the richer part of the area—going into Pontypridd, which is already far better off than is Rhondda. I am not quarrelling with this, but I think that the facts ought to be faced. Pontypridd, with the admitted advantage of having the Treforest industrial estate already within its boundaries, now gets the major industrial part of Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre Rural District. What seems to me to be stupidity in the extreme is to split up the new Ynysmardy industrial estate into two parts, again with the major part going to an authority already having a major industrial estate within its own boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rhondda Council, in their submission on this matter, suggested what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
to me seem far more reasonable and far more realistic proposals. Briefly, they were that the Rhondda Borough Council and the Llantrisant and Llantwit Fardre Rural District should be amalgamated into one authority. That would create an authority with a population of 127,220, against 111,640 in the White Paper, with a rateable value of £2,590,722, against £1,841,594 in the White Paper, and a population density per acre of 3 01, against 3–62, in the White Paper; and—here is the most important point—with a rateable value per head of population of £20–36 against £16–50 in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority put forward proposals of their own, they have a duty to give the reasons why the proposals can be implemented with authorities which surround them. They further suggested that the Pontypridd Urban District Council, the Aberdare Urban District Council and the Mountain Ash Urban District Council should become one authority. If that were done it would also be a strong and viable authority, with an urban population of 107,090, against 54,000 for the proposed New Pontypridd and Llantrisant South—I give the odd figures—and 67,000 for Aberdare and Mountain Ash, with a rateable value of £2,418,667, against £1,898,557 for the proposed New Pontypridd and Llantwit Fardre South and £1,276,500 for the New Aberdare. The population density would be 2–95, against 2–48 in the Pontypridd area and 2–65 in Aberdare. The rateable value per head of population would be £22–59, against £34–73 for Pontypridd and £18–67 for Aberdare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These, I believe, are sensible proposals for reform. The lowest rateable value per head of population would be increased from £16–50 to £20–36, making a much more viable and strong unit of local government than the proposal recommended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these proposals are too far-reaching for the Secretary of State to adopt—and I ask him to give further serious consideration to them—he should in any case extend the new boundaries of The Rhondda, as proposed by him, at least to the edge of Talbot Green, which would take the whole of the new Ynysmardy industrial estate within the new Rhondda authority and not split it
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
up. Surely diat is practicable and sensible—at least if we do not accept the major proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about the diminution of our functions which are inferred in the proposals, but as time is passing. I will content myself with asking for an assurance that there will be much more consultation with local authorities on this matter before final decisions are taken. There are minor adjustments which I consider to be practical and which should be looked at in respect of the authorities which I have mentioned. For instance, it seems to me nonsensical that we should propose that the village of Trehaford be split up into two. That would not add to or take away from either authority, but it is sensible, I think, that the whole of Trehaford should be one community, and obviously, as a continuation of The Rhondda, it should go into The Rhondda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point which I should like to raise concerns Gilfach Goch. Here we have another ridiculous situation. There is one small part of Gilfaen which I think is called Evanstown. I am sure that my hon. Friends would agree that a proposal involving bringing the new authority right through Bridgend, Pontypridd and part of The Rhondda into this little patch in Gilfach Goch is ludicrous. That ought to be tidied up. There are one or two other small issues involving Mardy and Aberdare, on the Mardy side of the mountain, which ought to be put right. I do not see much difficulty in these matters. They can easily be put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final word is to tell the Secretary of State that his proposals for Rhondda do not deal with the fundamental problem of making local authorities of a viable and health character, and to plead with him not to close his mind to the proposals which have been put to him by The Rhondda Borough Council and which I have attempted briefly to put to the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In approaching the question of local government, it would be wise for us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
bear in mind what is, perhaps, the fundamental problem of our time, not only in Wales and in the other countries of Britain but through the world, and that is the breakdown of the structure of society. This disintegration in local society, in the neighbourhood, and up to the national society, is happening almost everywhere. A distant example is what is happening in Peru. Forty years ago Lima was a very handsome Spanish city of some 175,000 people. Today it is a sprawling mass—a hideous mass—of some three million people, collected together largely in slums. This structural breakdown, it seems to me, has the same basic cause—the mobility of labour, much loved by our economists. That, in turn, is due to the ease of transport and the ease of other communications, the result of modern techniques.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is from this breakdown in social structure that many of our social difficulties spring, such as the strain from which people suffer today, much of the hooliganism, the crime, the ugliness, the hopelessness, the loneliness, the spiritual death, which are so evident in our rootless conurbations. There is no greater need today than to create the conditions in which community can develop; and where community already exists, it must be strengthened. Certainly we should take the greatest care possible to avoid action which breaks down community structure. Community is essential to the human person, and that means a community which the individual person can comprehend, in which he is rooted and with which he can identify. The most fundamental criticism which can be made of the Government White Paper is that it shows little awareness of that fact. Its approach is legalistic and bureaucratic rather than sociological.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donnelly</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been carefully following the hon. Member's argument about the community structure. I have a great deal of sympathy with him. But the problem of Lima, and the problem of any of these great cities into which people suddenly rush, is the problem of industrialisation. The end of the world may now be coming in Lima. It might have been argued that it came in the days of Robert Owen in Manchester, for society was disorganised then.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member, it has not always taken place. It is a characteristic of our present age. Although industrialisation makes its contribution, the main reason is the mobility, the ease with which people can move about and the ease of communication generally. At any rate, if the Government had studied a number of countries in Europe where local government is firmly based upon the local community, they could have learned a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in Norway there are 20 county councils, and 451 local district councils called "municipalities". Denmark has 25 county councils, 88 borough councils and 1,000 district municipalities. In Switzerland, where there is extreme decentralisation, the commune and the canton are the fundamental government forms, and both are real communities. In some cantons the government serves a population little bigger than that of Radnorshire, but all the canton governments have greater powers than even the Stormont Government in Northern Ireland. In Switzerland there are 3,100 communes, and this is a country just about twice the size of Wales; it works out at about 2,000 people per commune, and the commune governments have extensive powers. They have an independence that comes from their financial autonomy, and the constitution gives them virtual immunity from amalgamation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Sweden was one of the countries examined by the Maud Commission which said the local government of that country: "leaves it with 900 primary authorities, with populations below 5,000 which are yet responsible for nearly all the local government functions".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The equivalent number in Wales is about 300. I quote two other passages
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I1419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
from the Maud Commission Report about Sweden:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities have more independence than any other known to the writer. This autonomy is related to their financial position, for though many of them have a small population, they are richer in financial resources than any other local authorities in the world."</p></blockquote>
The other quotation is from the conclusions at the end of this section of the Report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The context of Swedish local government is that of a small modern country, prosperous, efficient and democratic, with great respect for individual rights and local sentiment."</p></blockquote>
How I wish that that could be said about Wales! It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The characteristics of the local government itself, many of which are shared by the other Scandinavian countries, are its wide span of duties, independence and financial autonomy."</p></blockquote>
This is reflected in the interest the people take in local government there, because in local government elections in Sweden no less than 80 per cent. on average of the electorate votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
West Germany is in some ways the most surprising example of all. It has 24,000 local government units with major functions, and 20,000 of these have populations smaller than 2,000.

It is true that there is to be a reduction in the number of local authorities in Germany, as there is in Sweden, but there have been two local government reforms in Sweden in recent years, but still there is this large number of small authorities. The Swedes want to keep it that way, and there are strong sociological reasons for doing so. At any rate, they do not have the prejudice that we have here against the small unit, and we belong to a country where the State system is one of the most highly centralised in the world, and the Government now propose to centralise it still further by abolishing 11 of the 13 county councils and replacing them by four or five which will serve areas three times the present size, and to abolish 164 rural district and urban councils, replacing them by 35, and not to establish a strong neighbourhood council at the base.

I asked the right hon. Gentleman whether the Government had considered this at all. He said that he would tell me in the course of his argument, but we did not hear about it.

That they are not too small is shown by the examples I have given from other countries; if they are too weak, that is due to Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the situation from the standpoint that I have outlined, we can certainly see no place for the rural district councils. They should go, not because they are too small or too weak, but because they do not serve a social entity, and it is always a social entity which should be the basis of local government and national government. Rural district councils serve no neighbourhood. For the most part they are artificial concepts, artificial creations, and they are inspired by no sense of community.

It is a different matter for the small and large towns whose councils are to go. In a town one has a compact urban community which demands a council of its own. Sometimes market towns can be the centre of a rural community for local government purposes, but there are areas where the rural community is focussed upon some large village, and that village should be the centre of a neighbourhood council—a "Cyngor bro"; I think the Welsh phrase is better than the English. Certainly we should avoid the bureaucratic passion for tidiness at all costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government commit the small town to oblivion, as they do, they show little awareness of what goes with it. In my constituency I have, apart from the county town of Carmarthen, four small towns, two of them small boroughs—Cydweli and Llandyfri—and two urban district councils at Llandeilo and Newcastle Emlyn.

Councils of effective members have in each of these cases done a good job of work for their little towns, for which they care passionately, and we must not think that these people are less able than people who serve on bigger authorities. That is a mistake, a mistake often made, but from my own experience I know it is not true, because, for one thing, these people are drawn from a wider range. They can meet at night, which is a big advantage, for they do not have to meet during the day, and they meet near their homes, of course. But for the work that these—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not adequately dealt with, certainly not dealt with as the possible basis of a structure of local government. Only a passing mention is given to it and the White Paper speaks of it as the kind of council we now have in the parishes. That is not what I have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking of the councils of small towns and of the way in which they serve their communities. But for these councils, the present and the future of these small urban communities would be considerably bleaker. People with problems turn to these councillors. If there are 12 or 15 councillors in a town of 2,000, everybody knows them. If someone has no councillor in the same street, he has one in the next. Here we have a splendid example of participation locally. There is nothing remote, nothing impersonal, about this kind of administration, and the people are vitally interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At elections to small councils people turn out in greater numbers than they do for large councils—that is true of Wales. For the larger authorities there is never a turn-out of more than 40 per cent., and it is sometimes less than 30 per cent. For the small councils it is never below 45 per cent. and it goes up to 68 per cent. Some people have been talking a lot about participation in this part of the world. Here is participation in the life of the community, and what do the Government propose to do with it? They want to get rid of it and thus weaken the structure of the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same kind of thing, although not so intensively, is true of the counties, too. Nearly every county in Wales has a sense of history. They have their own written histories. There are historical societies, publications and even county archivists in almost every county in Wales. County consciousness is now so strong that in London the strongest Welsh societies are county societies. It is weakest in the two most populous counties, the only two which the Government propose to retain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, too, the sense of community and local participation will be reduced without

	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
any corresponding gains to offset the losses. Nothing will be gained in this way that could not have been gained through methods of co-operation. Even in small urban or rural areas, one could co-operate by having the same clerk, for instance, for half a dozen authorities. There is no reason why this could not be done as it is done in other counties. Better councillors may not be found in this way. My constituency is 15 miles across and under the new system there will be constituencies three times that size to be served, and the distances to be travelled will be far greater. Membership of councils may be almost restricted to retired people or the professionally party-political, and this would be a great drawback.

The White Paper says that this plan is necessary because these authorities are too weak. But in what ways are three weak and poor authorities strengthened and made more wealthy by being knocked together? They have the same revenue; they have the same costs. The costs of running the schools are the same; the costs of building the roads are the same; the costs of the welfare services are the same. One does not save anything financially, but one loses much in local participation. The argument that one
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
will have abler officers is very dubious. In some cases there may be abler officers, but when a poor choice is made, the damage done by a poor official will be three times as great.

This is the old argument about uniting the states of Germany into a big country all over again. It had some advantages, but when one has a Hitler in charge of the country, obviously it has disadvantages, for he can do a lot more damage than he could do in a little country like Bavaria. This applies in all matters of local government and national government. It would be a bold man who would say that there are abler people running Great Britain than run the small countries of Scandanavia, even including Iceland. It is the worship of bigness which has vitiated the whole of the Government's thinking about local government.

Finally, I turn very briefly to the national community. If the London Government had established an elected council for Wales with planning powers and adequate finance, that would have had value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
