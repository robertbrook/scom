	<div class='legislation'>Education in Wales</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i> [this day],
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of education in Wales.—[	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for lunch I was discussing the support in my consitutency among heads and teachers for the Government's reforms. I mentioned the head of a local primary school who said, in reference to LMS, "Now that I am director of education for this community, I have control and responsibility for my school's budget. I can allocate it according to the needs of my school." That view has been welcomed widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are worries that the pace of reform has been carried out too hastily, with too little consultation and with inadequate consideration of the administrative burden that will fall on headmasters, especially in smaller schools in which headmasters have to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Government's achievements there is a need for consolidation and consensus. Two years ago the mere utterance of those words by Conservative Members would have made the Front Bench shout, or perhaps screech, "Send him to the tower. Off with his head!;" That is what happened to my right hon. Friend the Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen) who lost his place in the Cabinet because he dared to utter the word "consolidation". I have noticed that the words "consolidation" and "consensus" are creeping back into the parliamentary lexicon, and they are occasionally uttered by the Government Front Bench. I am glad to see that even my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has dared to use them. Within the next few months, they may become fashionable and—who knows?—the Under-Secretary of State for Wales may use them. I am glad that he is in Committee to hear my remarks. Like other hon. Members, I have visited schools. I shall go quickly through my impressions. I agree with the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) that the national curriculum is too detailed and restrictive. Even my right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) realised when she saw the huge piles of documents on different subjects that the national curriculum had taken a turn that she did not expect and that it had become too detailed. That was also the view of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House when he held the education portfolio. There was a feeling that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
national curriculum had to out of hand and that there was too much detail for teachers to absorb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a shortage of textbooks in various subjects, especially in Welsh. The hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) mentioned the stock in a school library; I agree with him. When I visit a school one of the first things that I ask about is the library stock. When a school has to hold back its spending, one of the first things to suffer is its library stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with the number of Welsh language teachers, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State discussed. I shall not repeat that point. However, despite the Government's initiatives and despite the encouragement in teacher training colleges for those training to do so in Welsh, there is a shortage of teachers using the Welsh language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about funding. Is the funding that is available through education support grants and local education authority training grant schemes adequate? There was £7 million available for 1989–90, £10 million for 1990–91 and £14.5 million for 1991–92. I do not want to detract from the fact that the Government have increased spending but, given the extent and complexity of the problem, I wonder whether that was enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about standard assessment tasks, given their first year of application, and I am particularly worried about their impact on seven-year-olds. I have two reports from head teachers in my constituency, whose schools I visited. I asked them to let me know their teachers' views on standard assessment tasks. I understand that the School Examinations and Assessment Council is reviewing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pilot schemes led to the Government slimming down materials and assessment arrangements, but I am not sure that enough slimming down was done. There is still a feeling that they take too long and are too stressful on pupils. There is also difficulty obtaining books for SATs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One report on SATs from head teacher W. G. Hughes concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Considerable time spent on preliminary work and during SAT period. All done in one's own time.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Too heavy a work load on top of usual work connected with preparation of lessons.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>SATs impractical in its present form. Too time consuming and not fair to rest of class. With all the will in the world impossible to concentrate on all the children in the class while the SATs were in progress.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>No provision has been made to indicate a child's level when he or she commenced full-rime education, and the subsequent achievement that has taken place during the first two years of schooling.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The assessments are unfair because they do nor take into account the rate of development of children. Some children at the age of 7 might appear as low achievers or even failures and these same children could within a few months reach a far higher attainment level.</p></blockquote>
There are also comments on the good aspects of SATs:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All practical work was well enjoyed. The Story Discussion was popular. Working on a Theme was a good plan."</p></blockquote>
The report attempted to give a balanced assessment, but the question is one of the time involved and the stress put on children, as well as the use of the word "test".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I recall my 11-plus examination as a horrid experience because I was made to sit a test. The teachers' guidance handbook uses the word "activities", but all children know that they are being tested. A problem exists here. We want to move more towards an assessment and less towards the idea of an obstacle that children see ahead. We want less defining of seven-year-olds into categories, especially as they might move out of them rapidly at that age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also anxious about the publication of league tables. I am aware that that is to enable parents to compare the performances of their local schools, and that is good. The Government have said, in response to points that I have raised, that they have enabled parents to make the comparison while taking account of circumstances that are unique to the school and any other factors affecting it, but how can that be done? The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney also asked that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give as an example a village school in my constituency. It is in a deprived area. Some 75 per cent of its pupils take school meals because their parents are receiving supplementary benefit, so the meals are free. I have visited the school and I know the teachers. Nowhere in the principality could one find a more committed bunch of people, but they are worried about the publication of the results. They feel that publication is an unfair measure of the work that they do because they are actually raising educational standards from a very low base. That in itself is an achievement, but it will not be measured by SATs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. I took the Secretary of State for Wales to a school meeting with the head to discuss LMS, as the right hon. Gentleman mentioned this morning. He should have described the other side of the coin, which was that the head master of Penydre school thought that league tables would be disastrous to the morale and development of schools such as his. The hon. Gentleman makes precisely that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support and I hope that the Government will take my argument on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LMS is about delegating and devolving—my favourite word, as the Committee knows. I could not be against local management; on the contrary, I am strongly in favour of it. The problem is the way in which it works. The chief factor in deciding how much money a school receives is the number and age of pupils: it is effectively pupil-led funding. The Government see this as an incentive to schools to attract pupils by offering them the best education. There is nothing wrong with that. What worries me is the potentially detrimental effect of pupil-led funding on the ability of schools to pay experienced, stable, long-serving staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite another example from my constituency. There is a small school with a low turnover of staff who have remained for many years, at the highest pay level. The school is now worried about is ability to continue to pay them. The Government have said that such schools will be given a number of years to decide how to adjust
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
towards budgets when making new appointments. That is all very well, but I wonder how they will do it. How many years will they be allowed? Some schools face a serious problem. The Government have said that they will consider sympathetically proposals from LEAs, but how will they help these schools? Will long-serving, experienced staff be replaceed by cheaper staff? This is an important point. The principle of LMS is absolutely right, but the Government must address the problem of long-serving, stable staff. There is no use their saying that there will be a huge turnover because, thank goodness, in many rural schools there is not a huge turnover, which is why they have such high standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an important point, but I return to an issue that I raised earlier. How will LMS relate to highly experienced and highly professional staff, many of whom have been in their positions for a long time, who offer specialised services to schools? That particularly relates to the teachers of handicapped people and the peripatetic teachers of music and other subjects to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) referred. How will they fit into the overall framework of this brave new world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of peripatetic teaching and special needs is important and provision for that will be retained centrally. We touched on that earlier and as I am conscious of the time and know that other hon. Members want to speak, I shall not go into it in too much detail. However, I am worried about what the review says about the subject. Much needs to be done to identify the learning difficulties of pupils and LEAs should carry out more surveys. Individual programmes of work need to be prepared and in the majority of schools the position is less than satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the LEAs must deal with that; ultimately, it is a question of resources. It is important to retain staff for special needs. That is that last area in which one wants a big turnover. Experienced teachers get to know the pupils with learning difficulties and those pupils need stability and do not want to keep seeing new faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Government that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if standards of education in this country are to he raised—it is essential to have a well-qualified and well-paid reaching force—which is dedicated to serving the needs of pupils and is held in high esteem in the country."</p></blockquote>
That is an admirable statement and we must work towards its fulfilment—not just at election time. I welcome Monday's announcement that the review body report will be met in full and will not be scaled back or phased in. I am sure that that has nothing to do with Easter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the additional allocation of £3.5 million to the LEAs is, according to the press release from the Welsh Office
	<br><blockquote><p>"to help cover the cost of the award."</p></blockquote>
I want to know how far that will fall short of covering the whole award. That is important. I have many differences with my county council regarding spending—I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
shall not mention the castle—but it cannot have that thrust on it at this time, particularly when it has a backlog of school building maintenance. The award is essential to raise morale, retrain existing staff and increase recruitment. Teachers' pay must be increased steadily to attract high-quality recruits. We shall not be able to compete with Germany or Japan or anywhere else—I shall not mention the United States in view of Japan's comments on it—unless pupils have the best possible education and that means the highest quality of teachers. We must work hard towards that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the review body when it says that the top priority is properly designed performance-related pay arrangements. We need targeted incentives for experienced teachers for scarce subjects—the report lists subjects for which it is difficult to find teachers—and for hard-to-staff schools. Kids must not suffer because they come from a deprived community and go to school in the middle of a deprived area of a town or of a rural area. The Government must provide incentives to counterbalance the difficulties such schools may have in finding staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the increased number of applications for teacher training, but I am worried about turnover: 5 per cent a year leave the profession and among new entrants the proportion is as high as one third within five years, although half of them return. We must consider job sharing, child care schemes and part-time working. I am worried about the low number of applicants for each vacancy. About a third of vacancies have only three or four applicants. In the south-east of England two thirds of vacancies have only three to four applicants. That is very bad. I should like to know what the ratio is for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the inspectorate and I do not want to repeat my remarks. We have only 58 inspectors who spend 65 per cent of their time going round schools and 35 per cent of their time advising. I am worried that we will lose that expertise through a registration or licence scheme. We must look at the Scottish scheme. If they can do something different from England, why cannot we?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the award to teachers, can I assure my hon. Friend that the £3.5 million is additional to what has been allocated in anticipation of an increase before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able also to assure us when he replies to the debate that the previous allocation, plus the £3.5 million, will be enough to cover it all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so. I am sure that all the county councils and LEAs will be very happy. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State wrote to me not long ago saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recognise that the introduction of education reforms have imposed a demanding schedule on teachers."</p></blockquote>
It is too demanding. Too much has been done too quickly. The pace has been too fast. My right hon. and
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science says that his aim now is to take forward the reform programme and maintain the momentum. We must look at consolidation and building on what we have achieved through consensus. I am worried about his further initiative, particularly in training and his plans to move training from colleges more to schools. Schools are having a hard enough job absorbing and digesting the national curriculum, SATs and LMS. He is now taking an initiative in primary education as a result of SATs. I do not disagree with that, but the inquiry was announced in December and only two months were allowed to carry it out. How can one consult in that period? How can a report, which is to be achieved by consensus and is to be as influential as Plowden was, be produced in such a short time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is taking a different course here. There will be wider consultation on primary teaching methods in Wales and evidence will be taken from the profession in moving to a more gradual, consensual approach. That is the way to go. According to that extremely left-wing newspaper, the 	<i>Financial Times,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the priority now is to stop making endless policy on the hoof."</p></blockquote>
Wales's education provision needs to be examined fully, calmly and deliberately taking evidence from all in the field, even abroad and yes, including Scotland. We must harness and not ignore the professionalism of teachers without whose co-operation no education reforms can succeed. The Government cannot dictate teaching methods. The only way they can move forward is with the co-operation, enthusiasm and whole-hearted support of the teaching profession. At present their morale is distressingly low. We need a consensual approach to replace conflict and dissension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's responsibility is to safeguard basic education standards and opportunities. Their role is one of oversight and monitoring. They must let the reforms settle down. They must stop turning schools upside down. I quote from one of my heroes in the Conservative party, the late Sir Edward Boyle, who was and Education Minister and Vice-Chancellor of Leeds University. He once said that we do not believe in equality but—and this is where I part company so strongly with the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones)—we do believe in equality of opportunity. All our policies and all our efforts must be geared towards that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great privilege to address the Committee again on the issue of education. I welcomed some of the Secretary of State's annnouncements this morning. There is to be a welcome increase in funding in certain areas. I welcome some of the investment that has recently been introduced in in-service training for teachers. It was a great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
honour for me recently to attend Gwent college of higher education and present the INSET awards. Many innovations in teacher training have taken place at that college. Education and training for those involved in education is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am concerned about the Secretary of State's statement. He said nothing about nursery education—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Secretary of State said that he did not say anything about nursery education. Parents throughout my constituency are concerned that there is no opportunity for children to be educated before the age of five. Women want their children to have pre-school education, but it is not possible. It is a vital area of equal opportunities and it needs major new investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour party policy is that all three and four-year-olds whose parents wish it should have access to nursery education. It is scandalous than in areas of my constituency—half of Monmouth—there is no nursery education provision whatever. Gwent county council has a slightly better record than other authorities, but given present constraints and the lack of a major Government initiative it cannot increase nursery education provision as people want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that the reason why there is less nursery education in Monmouth compared with the rest of Gwent—for instance the Newport area achieved 100 per cent at one time—is that the old authority was not sympathetic to such a policy whereas the authorities in the Newport area were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. It is a tragedy that in the Overmonnow area of Monmouth there is an empty former infants school. It could easily be converted for nursery education. It is unreasonable to expect parents to travel further away to get any chance of nursery education for their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents in my constituency are concerned about the morale of teachers. The hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan) referred to that problem. I have visited many schools in my constituency, some of them fine schools that have done well in national education assessment—for example King Henry VIII school in Abergavenny, Croesyceiliog comprehensive school, Monmouth comprehensive school and Chepstow comprehensive school. The feeling of those in secondary education is that they are having to teach in more and more difficult circumstances. They have the commitment, but the circumstances in which they have to preform their vocation—it is a vocation—have deteriorated considerably in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents are also concerned about the backlog of repairs in schools in Gwent. Gwent county council estimates that it has a £15 million backlog of repairs. Currently, precisely £1 million is allocated for repairs to secondary schools and precisely £1 million for primary schools. That shows the scandalous amount of repairs outstanding in Gwent, as in other areas of Wales. That needs to be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I went to an infants school in Chepstow—Pembroke Road school. It was built in 1950 and
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
is largely an aluminium construction that had a 25 to 30-year lifespan. There are no plans for that school to be renewed and it has a growing problem of leaking roofs. I happened to be there when officials from Gwent education authority were visiting the school and was able to talk to the chair of the governors and the new head teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disappointed me most about the Secretary of State's speech was his comments about the inspectorate. The whole educational world remains totally unconvinced by the Government's proposals for greatly reducing Her Majesty's inspectorate and privatising major parts of it. Two weeks ago Her Majesty's inspectors decided to lobby Parliament en masse because they fear mass redundancies. In the past such action would have been inconceivable. After working in education for many years they switched to the inspectorate, but now suddenly find that the Government are prepared virtually to abandon the independent inspectorate in its current form. We are conscious of the need for inspectors to visit schools more often and to produce more reports. The answer is not to privatise the inspectorate, but to provide adequate investment and to give it the resources that it needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the political traditions in my constituency, and many of my constituents would be absolutely appalled if they fully understood the Government's aims with regard to the privatisation of the inspectorate. My constituency contains fine state and independent schools, all of which are subject to the inspectorate. They have been able to maintain their very high standards because of the threat of regular visits from inspectors. When I was a teacher and lecturer I always knew that inspectors could come into my classroom at any time—they did not need to be invited. People working in education should always be aware of that. I had colleagues who were always too willing to cancel classes at short notice. Had they been more conscious of the role of Her Majesty's inspectorate, as are many teachers in Wales, they may not have acted in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the tradition of the inspectorate in Wales. Those who have studied the history of education in Wales will know of the great contribution made by Sir O. M. Edwards in the late 19th and early 20th century. His work instilled in all of us who have an interest in education in Wales principles and commitments that we will never lose—it was an ethos of education. In Kenneth Morgan's great history of modern Wales, these few lines refer to the role of Sir O. M. Edwards as an inspector:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He had a genius for communication to the young, and for quiet encouragement of the raw talents of the sons and daughters of the Welsh working class. More generally Edwards's remarkably magnetic personality, angular and difficult though he could sometimes be, captivated his generation."</p></blockquote>
Kenneth Morgan also writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"His visitations to Welsh schools, when he could discourse on European history, literature, and philosophy over a wide range, were memorable for the children who experienced them."</p></blockquote>
That tradition has been infused into whole generations of people committed to education in Wales. I ask the Secretary of State to dwell on the work of people such as Sir O. M. Edwards before he destroys the tradition of the inspectorate.

Last night on the Floor of the House I had the privilege of contributing to the debate on the Further and Higher Education Bill. We support key parts of the Bill, such as the end of the binary divide. I am very pleased that the polytechnic of Wales will be recreated as the university of Glamorgan. I am glad that a parity will be established between universities and polytechnics, and I hope that the existing universities will learn some lessons about good teaching from polytechnics. I hope also that the new universities will receive sufficient resources to enable them to carry out their academic tasks and engage in research on an equal footing with existing universities. Those proposals present an exciting new challenge for higher education throughout Britain, especially in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a concern, however, about the provisions in the Bill for further education. We do not need to be convinced that the only reason why the Government introduced those provisions was because of the cost of the poll tax. The Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), wanted to take all education out of local authority control. He did not succeed in doing so, but he was able to influence the decision to bring sixth-form colleges out of local education authority control. There is widespread concern that by losing local accountability they will be unable to provide a service that is integrated with local schools, as they do at present. Such colleges are quite different from polytechnics. Corporate status may be acceptable for polytechnics, but I very much doubt that it is acceptable for sixth-form and other further education colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks ago, just before Christmas, I had the privilege of visiting Newport college of further education in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Mr. Hughes). I was impressed with its wide range of courses, which lead many young people on to higher education. People who previously would never have envisaged going on to higher education are now doing access courses. I commend the Government for the increased higher education opportunity brought about in the past 12 years by that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the increase in student numbers. I was certainly aware of it when I was a lecturer, before becoming a Member of Parliament. There should be a commensurate increase in the number of lecturing and teaching staff. I found it increasingly difficult to maintain good teaching standards when I had to teach seminar groups of 20 or more students. A proportionate increase in library facilities and resources is vital. One of the big mistakes that the Government made in the early 1980s was to encourage polytechnics and universities to cut back on their library resources. The Labour party has grave reservations about some of the changes being instituted. I will not forgive the Government for the increasing student hardship, to which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) referred. Students have been penalised by the Government by having benefits withdrawn, which is part of all the social security changes that the Government have introduced. That withdrawal of ben-
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
efit is absolutely shameful. Hon. Members who represent Cardiff or any other town in which there is a University or a polytechnic will know what hardship students suffer in the housing market. The student loan scheme has been an absolute flop. Grants have been frozen. The economic effect of the recession on parents who must make a contribution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Mon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that students find it difficult to manage not only in term time but in the holidays—particularly the summer holidays—because of the cuts in social security? We should look at the whole picture not just narrow aspects of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. Students are one of the groups that the vultures of social security, the Government, attacked in the Social Security Act 1986. The Government made serious errors in their treatment of students.

Within a few weeks we shall have a Labour Government. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is a confident prediction—as confident as the prediction that we would win the Monmouth by-election in May 1991. A Labour Government will ensure that all three and four-year-olds whose parents wish it have access to nursery education. A Labour Government will be committed to earmarked funds for investment in books, classrooms and libraries. They will be committed to ensuring that school classes do not contain more than 40 pupils, with a progressive policy towards classes with no more than 30 pupils. We will have a programme of repairing crumbling schools and of setting new targets to increase the proportion of 16 and 17-year-olds staying in full-time education. We must restore the confidence and morale of those who have given their professional lives to education. Our aim is to create the best educated nation in Europe. The key to that is policies that are dedicated to modernising, not to privatising, education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall quote from the hon. Member for Cambridge (Sir R. James) who, sadly, made his last speech in the House last night. In a very dignified contribution to the Second Reading debate of the Further and Higher Education Bill, he talked about those educational values that we should not lose. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall now return to academic life; to scholarship; to the love of learning for its own sake"—</p></blockquote>
that last sentiment should be applied to the adult education provisions of the Further and Higher Education Bill. We should move away from the nonsense that there is a difference between vocational and leisure courses—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which I believe is still the dominant purpose of education; to the excitement of a new generation eager to learn; to the sheer fun of education, which people sometimes forger; and to the joy of seeing one's students do well and to the sadness of sometimes seeing them not do as well as one would wish."</p></blockquote>
He finished by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a glow about the glory of true educaiton."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1992; Vol. 203, c. 872.]</p></blockquote>
I regret that that glow has disappeared for many people in education in the past 12 years. I hope that, in two

months' time, we will have a Labour Government who will restore it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In taking up the remarks of the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), I agree with what he said about the Polytechnic of Wales and the opportunities that are now opening up for it. The Polytechnic of Wales is a most excellent institution. I know that it will seize the greatest advantage from the new opportunity and add even more lustre to its reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with practically anything else that the hon. Gentleman said, but I congratulate him on making the most positive, forward-looking speech that I have heard from the Opposition throughout today's debate. What a contrast the hon. Gentleman's remarks were to the opening address by the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). One would have thought that he would have set out the Labour party's policy on education for the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speech of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside was amazing, not for its content, but for its omission. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who spoke for almost half an hour, but noted down only two policy proposals—on nursery education and reading programmes for younger children. In themselves, they are both important, but they are by no means a comprehensive Labour party policy on education in Wales or in the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my knowledge, the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside made the same speech today that he has made at every sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee since 1983. It was the usual litany of complaints. A general election will be held within a few months at most, so where were the alternative policies or the comprehensive approach? All the hon. Gentleman's claims were purely self-serving. Cannot he break away from being totally negative and destructive towards Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed especially that the hon. Gentleman refused to give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer). The hon. Gentleman gave the finest imitation of the mechanical hare on a greyhound track: he was desperate to leave the course before those who were really in the race caught up with him, as they were already snapping at his heels. It behoves us to be positive about education as it behoves us to be positive about all other subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome two announcements made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State this morning: first, the £1.9 million worth of grants for the Welsh language, which I am sure that that will be welcomed widely in the Principality and secondly of equal importance, the teachers' pay increase, which was first announced on Monday. I am sure that that is welcomed by the teaching profession throughout Wales. As we know, teachers have suffered dreadfully from what their trade unions have done in their names. It has lowered their public esteem and, in consequence, their morale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the teachers' salary increase, but I am told that it will
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
increase the expenditure of Gwynedd county council because of poll tax capping. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that an adjustment must be made to take account of that, if local authorities are not to get into all sorts of trouble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has already referred to that in previous interventions and he may want to return to it more fully—perhaps, in this evening's debate on the rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government on what they have done to reverse the damage caused by the teachers' unions and to restore teachers' public esteem and teachers' morale. That is one virtue of an independent pay review. It is obviously the way to resolve teachers' remuneration and I recommend its extension to other areas, where it would be equally desirable. Universities come to mind, but I understand that the Government have not yet been persuaded of that. They recognise that there are significant difficulties for the independent employers in the university sector. I commend that principle to my right hon. Friend and hope that we see progress with an independent pay review for academics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members referred to Her Majesty's inspectors of education. Like the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), I, too, was lobbied a fortnight ago. I had a long conversation with Mr. Neville Evans, an HMI who lives in my constituency. He explained to me that HMIs have reservations about the proposed changes, not least an understandable concern about what might happen to those who are presently employed as HMIs. Mr. Evans told me that people are usually recruited to the inspectorate in mid-career: they have moved on from teaching and are that much nearer retirement. Their employment prospects need to be borne in mind just as much as anyone else's. I was impressed by the positive attitude of HMIs in wanting to ensure that the changes work as well as possible. On behalf of my constituent and other HMIs, I wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to put forward those views. I look forward to his reply, which I know will be positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the references to local advisory services somewhat unrealistic. During the past 10 years, I have been deputy chairman of the board of governors of many primary schools in my constituency. During that time I have been familiar with the complaints and worries of local head teachers about the quality of the advice that they receive from local education authorities. Not all the advice is necessary. They would often prefer to have less advice and more flexibility, making progress on their own. In the same vein, it is disturbing that although capital expenditure has increased by 24 per cent, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State reported successive instances of underfunding by local education authorities, saying that they do not take full advantage of the provisions to improve our schools. That is most significant for me because, sadly, South Glamorgan county council is one of the lowest spenders per head on education. That underlines what I was told by the headmaster of one of the leading primary schools in the north of my constituency. He is relatively content with his budget. Unfortunately, he cannot buy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
what he needs for the school because the education authority had previously allowed substantial repairs to accumulate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are too many unofficial committees going on in the Room. I am finding it difficult to hear the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As has been underlined, head teachers feel that if their education authorities had provided them with a level playing field, the money that they have now would be more or less adequate and would provide a far better future. The problem is repairing the neglect. The example I gave is not an isolated one; the same applies in almost all primary and secondary schools in my constituency. Much more can be accomplished, at a lower cost, by the continual process of devolution into the hands of head teachers. I see no small advantage in reducing the anxiety that head teachers constantly face—the frustration of telephoning the education department to get something done, to no avail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan) referred this morning to possible confusion about whether the school or the local education authority was responsible for repairs. He is right. I hope that we can make more progress in resolving that confusion. Where doubt arises, we should give head teachers more opportunity to take over the responsibility. They will achieve much more than was achieved under the previous system where such spending was controlled by the local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how much responsibility he envisages giving to headmasters? We have heard a great deal today about the crumbs that the Secretary of State has thrown at teaching through the medium of Welsh. A school in my constituency, ysgol gyfun Rhydfelen, has buildings that are falling apart. Is the headmaster supposed to ask for £4.5 million to rebuild the school? Presumably, the Sectetary of State will give him that money and tell him to get on with it—to ask for tenders from local builders and to carry on with the reconstruction of the school. Should the headmaster do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. I could cite similar but not such bad examples in my constituency. We can look forward to more devolution. Practical examples of repairing past neglect and taking more control, and of head teachers being freer to run their own lives illustrate the most significant aspect of the Government's reforms of the institution of grant maintained schools. I am not sure that "grant maintained" is a good name, as it does not readily convey what such schools are about. Grant maintained status is an excellent example of real devolution; the greatest amount of power is devolved to the schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hughes, for arriving late, but I had to attend to other parliamentary duties. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's case, but he is being unfair to local authorities about their handling of the school system. I am not trying to make a party political point, as this applies
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
to all parties when they are in government, but the Government have not given sufficient money to local authorities in south Wales to carry out the capital building programme that they require. In the valley constituencies schools built at the end of last century are now badly in need of repair and revitalisation. This Government, more than any other, have cut the capital building programme for schools. There is a huge backlog of work waiting to be done. It is no good beating the local authorities over the head. They cannot make resources available if central Government do not allow them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rush to disagree with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers). There is substance in what he says. However, I repeat what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said about past underspending: we have the opportunity of a 24 per cent increase in capital spending. I look forward to the even greater opportunities that grant maintained status and local management of schools are providing and will increasingly provide. They will bring more flexibility and allow schools to take greater advantage of the money available. I attach the greatest importance to grant maintained status. I reject the notion that those are opted-out schools. They are opted-in schools because they have opted in to the most local form of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State reminded us, Wales has shown the way forward. The constituency of Islwyn was the first to have a completely devolved school. It is right that the process has begun slowly in Wales. I prefer that it should begin slowly, instead of our rushing headlong into it. I am sure that when we debate the matter again in Committee towards the end of 1993, far more schools in Wales will have chosen devolution. I predict that within five years it will be the norm in Wales for the control of schools to be devolved locally. When the greatest amount of control is devolved to local level, we shall have the best prospect of the best schools offering the best choice to parents and children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to refer to an important constituency matter. Allansbank primary school is one of our older schools in an older part of Cardiff. There are not as many green fields around it as most schools would like. None the less, it is a very good school. I have visited the school and have met the head teacher, Mrs. Kay Andrews, the staff and the chairman of the governors. I know that they are as enthusiastic as any to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the reforms. That reinforces my judgment that Allansbank is an excellent school. However, they are apprehensive about the publication of their school's results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housed within the school are three special classes that accommodate children from the school's catchment area and children from throughout south Glamorgan. The school is concerned that the inclusion of the results of those three special classes in the results may impair its excellent local reputation, as the effect of having those three special classes may not be fully understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to see my right hon. Friend the Minister of State last week. I must put on record my appreciation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
of his ready response to the problem that I outlined. I was impressed by his understanding of and desire to help with the problems of Allansbank primary school, which are probably mirrored in several other schools throughout the Principality. It is important that parents know exactly what results mean: they should have the truest picture so that slightly unusual factors, such as special classes, are properly delineated in a way that does not impair the reputation of excellent schools, such as Allansbank primary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal briefly with issues that affect my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) referred to adult education, but I want to explore it in more detail. The Further and Higher Education Bill contains a severe threat to the provision of adult education, especially in valley communities. The Bill distinguishes between vocational and non-vocational courses, and between vocational and leisure courses. That distinction is wrong and false. For example, how can it be known whether a person is studying French to improve his holiday or to enable him to take up a job in the European Community? Similarly, and perhaps even more importantly in valley communities that have been deprived of job opportunities, perhaps through pit closures, such as the Neath and Dulais valleys, the Swansea valley and the Afan valley in my constituency, there is a vital need for adult education to reskill and to provide new educational opportunities for formerly redundant workers and women who have not had educational opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many centres in my Neath constituency have been very successful. I have in mind the Afan valley enterprise, the Glynneath training workshop and the Dove workshop in Banwen. They have drawn in women who started by bringing their children to the local creche provided by the centres and then, perhaps, took a cookery course. Under the Secretary of State's definition cookery would probably be classed as a leisure or non-vocational subject. When those women have gained confidence and have been drawn into the adult educational environment in a way in which they would not previously have dreamt of, they may go on to take a computer course and to gain a skill that equips them to do a job and so to contribute to the local economy as well as enhancing their own potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the damaging Further and Higher Education Bill the provision for non-vocational leisure interest education will not come within the ambit of the Further Education Funding Council for Wales; it will be dumped on local authorities. Although the Secretary of State for Education has said that funding will still be available for such courses through local education authorities, he has not been specific. Can the Secretary of State for Wales give a commitment to ring-fence certain direct provision from the Welsh Office to local education authorities, such as West Glamorgan county council, for adult leisure or non-vocational adult education courses? If not, I fear that such courses will be killed off. It is vital, because 85 per cent of the funding for the courses comes from the Welsh Office rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
than being raised locally through fees or from local authority provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Grist 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Apparently he does not trust his own Labour council to use the money that it is made available to it to provide the courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I should be happy to trust West Glamorgan county council if it had been allocated sufficient revenue support grant and standard spending assessment levels to continue to provide the courses. The hon. Gentleman will know that West Glamorgan county council yesterday had to announce £2.1 million-worth of cuts in its education budget. It cannot maintain its past levels of education provision, especially in special education and teacher support. The Government have washed their hands of adult education in non-vocational or leisure interests, which is so important in valley communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but all local authorities, regardless of party, will make cuts in the vulnerable, non-mandatory, discretionary areas such as adult education. The Secretary of State must understand that it is not a question of whether a local authority is Conservative or Labour. If the Secretary of State thinks that adult education occupies an important position in Welsh life, as the founding of Coleg Harlech and the development of the WEA show that it has over the years, he must protect the money that is given to local authorities for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must not make speeches when they intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) makes an extremely valid point. He represents a valley community, as do I. The Secretary of State and Conservative Members do not understand the deprivation that exists in the valley communities. Central Government's failure to provide guaranteed funds for leisure and non-vocational courses will hit the very many people on low incomes who live in Neath and the Neath valleys. They will not be able to afford the exorbitant, gigantic hike in fees that will be required if the courses are to be retained. Indeed, many courses may disappear, and that deprivation will be suffered most acutely by women. Women who are not in paid work will not be able to pay the fees that will be set. Pensioners will be another hard-hit group. Many thousands of pensioners in my constituency subsist on very low incomes indeed. Adult education has been a very liberating experience for them, but they will not be able to enjoy it in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State must give the Committee a categorical assurance that the Government's artificial, Philistine distincition between vocational and non-vocational education provision will be reversed. If he cannot make such an assurance, he must guarantee that the Welsh Office will ring-fence sufficient funds to ensure that the courses continue to be provided as abundantly as at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the linked matter of the funding of local education provision in my constituency. I have mentioned the regrettable fact that West Glamorgan
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
county council is to make cuts in education this year of £2.1 million. It is scandalous that the Welsh Office should provide a level of revenue support grant that is insufficient to enable West Glamorgan to maintain the high standards for which it is famous. It is famous not only for its extensive education provision but especially for its nursery education, which it provides on a scale that is almost without comparison in the rest of Wales and the United Kingdom. It is famous for the music, art and sport provision in its schools. However, that is all under threat because of the education cuts that it has to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a threat, as was mentioned earlier, because of the way in which local management of schools funding works. Whatever the principle involved, the lumps of money allocated to local schools are not sufficient. As a result, local primary schools have less room in their budgets to invite the excellent West Glamorgan Theatre Company, for example, to perform for local schools and communities. Such provision was previously made by West Glamorgan county council on a centralised basis, but the county has less money to provide for that kind of cultural activity because it is being sucked down to local schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important issue is the damage caused to local sport by the way in which LMS is operating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the miserable performance of Neath rugby club in recent months may be a direct result? Indeed, the miserable performance of Welsh rugby over the past decade may be because of the penny-pinching that discourages school teachers from giving up their time at evenings and weekends to teach children the basics of rugby. Perhaps that has led to the scandalous position of our national team.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree wholeheartedly with the latter part of my hon. Friend's intervention, but I disagree strongly with the former part. I believe that Neath will win the Schweppes cup, if not the league itself, with a late run of victories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right about sport in schools. The increase in charges for facilities such as fields and swimming pools which are necessarily imposed by local primary and secondary schools is enormously damaging to local club sport. It is essential that the Welsh Office recognises that problem and provides the necessary funding to overcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hunt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of hon. Members are throwing figures into the debate and alleging cuts. The hon. Gentleman mentioned £2.1 million in West Glamorgan. I should like to give him some figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount allowed under the standard spending assessment for West Glamorgan last year was £236 million. This year it is £254 million, which is an increase of £18 million, or 7.6 per cent The aggregate external finance, which is mainly the revenue support grant in the case of West Glamorgan, goes up 23.7 per cent, and the funding that comes from the centre is £184 million for this year. Next year the figure will be £227 million, which is £43.5 million more. Where are these cuts coming from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State and I have had this argument before. It is another example of how the right hon. Gentleman appears not to understand how local education authorities have to cope with his Government's policies. The figures may look fine on paper, or when he utters them in the sanctity of the House of Commons, but on the ground they make no impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State seriously imagine that West Glamorgan county council would voluntarily make cuts of £600,000 in discretionary awards to students or £300,000 in its special educational provision? The county is renowned for its generous educational provision. It is not slashing its budgets with enthusiasm, but because it is forced to by the Secretary of State.

In conclusion, we need a Government committed to funding education in Wales on a level which ensures that every citizen and school pupil gains from the education provided to fulfil their best hopes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A theme of several speeches today has been the neglect of school buildings. Such neglect is evident in my constituency where it is even worse than in other areas. Schools have leaking roofs and rotting windows and badly need painting. Many children have to work in a damp environment. In Dyfed there are many small primary schools in very old buildings, 50 of which, in 1992, have outside toilets. Children grow up in comfortable homes with three-piece suites, fitted carpets and bathrooms, yet they have to go outside to use the toilet, even in mid-winter, when they are at school. That is a sure sign of neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, consultants hired by Dyfed estimated the cost of backlog of repairs at about £28 million. Last summer, Dyfed asked for a meeting with the Secretary of State to discuss those problems which, regrettably, was refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was hoped that some of the deficit could be made up in this year's capital allocations. In the event, the amount allowed in credit approvals went up from £13 million to only £13.2 million, an increase of 1.3 per cent. That is a cut in real terms. If one takes out the £12.5 million ongoing capital programme, barely £500,000 was left to tackle the £28 million backlog of repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Labour party is in Government later this year, it will find that it has a mountain to climb, which will take several years, to rectify the neglect of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier to the Secretary of State about a problem in my constituency. I was pleased that, a fortnight ago, he found time to visit Ysgol Bro Myrddin
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
in Carmarthen, a former grammar school that I attended in the 1950s or 1960s, a long time ago. It was an old school in those days, damp, dark, dingy and inadequate even then. When the present Ysgol Bro Myrddin was first established in 1974, it was promised new premises. Throughout the 1980s, we hoped that Dyfed would have the resources for a new building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the unsatisfactory premises, which the Secretary of State endorsed as inadequate, the school has produced excellent academic results throughout the years. It is one of the best schools in Dyfed and probably in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The childen, their teachers and their parents deserve a new school and I am glad that the Secretary of State is carefully considering such a proposal from the director. There is an election pending and he has other things in his in-tray, but I hope that he will take an early decision, perhaps this side of the general election, on finance for a new school for Bro Myrddin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, in secondary and primary schools, parents, friends and relatives now have to contribute so that schools can buy vital equipment. The "Directory of Social Change" recently estimated that parents and charities contribute about £100 million to school funds. The National Foundation for Educational Research estimated that about one third of all spending on books and equipment in primary schools comes from parents's donations. That is very sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Sunday, a neighbour's little boy knocked on my door. He was taking part in a sponsored quiz for his primary school and was asking neighbours for contributions. We live in an area where people are reasonably well off and the school that that child attends, and schools in other middle-class areas, will probably get the necessary resources. But what about children from large families who live on estates in areas of high unemployment and other deprived communities? It is hard on children attending primary schools in those areas because their parents cannot afford to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a former science teacher and lecturer. I read recently that spending on science equipment in state schools averages £5.62 per pupil. That is one fifth of the amount spent in the private sector, where schools spend £30 per pupil on such equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ISIS—the Independent Schools Information Service—compared capital spending in the independent sector with that in the public sector. In 1989 capital spending in the independent sector was £384 per pupil; in the state sector it was £59 per pupil. That is a fivefold disparity between investment in equipment and buildings in the two sectors. The two-tier system is one of the root problems in education. Many members of the Cabinet and the Conservative party and their children were educated in private schools. Members of the Opposition are generally products of the state system. That two-tier system is part of the class structure in Britain and it does us no good as a society especially when we consider the skills and technology needed for modern employment. We need a wider, well-educated work force and it is not good enough for only 5 or 10 per cent to have a high-quality education, leaving the others to do menial tasks. All jobs now require a high skill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the children of parents on low incomes might be helped to acquire the higher and better education of which he speaks through our assisted places scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the assisted places scheme could assist 90 per cent of the population it would be fine. That is what the Opposition want. The Conservative party wants to assist only 5 or 10 per cent of the population. In this day and age, that is not good enough. Only a tiny minority benefit from assisted places, which deprive the other 90 per cent. If Britain wants to rival Germany and Japan, our schools and training courses must target every level of ability. Access to top-quality education is limited to a few. A smaller proportion of students in this country go on to higher education than is the case in most advanced countries. Britain especially fails the age group 16 to 18. Only a half are in full-time education; compare that with the figures for European countries, for Japan and for the United States where 80 or 90 per cent are in full-time education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the problems caused by inadequate school laboratories, the shortage of qualified science teachers and thus the numbers of non-specialist science teachers. That has had the unfortunate result, reported in the 	<i>Times Educational Supplement</i> last August, that the number of students taking A-level science examinations has fallen for the 10th successive year. I took maths, physics and chemistry many years ago and that statistic upsets me; it cannot be good for the future of manufacturing industry and research and development. Science is in pretty dire straits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In October last year, the 	<i>Western Mail</i> published an article by Professor Sir John Meurig Thomas, who was educated at Gwendraeth grammar school and is one of the most distinguished Welsh scientists of his generation. He is the president of the Royal Institution of Great Britain and the deputy pro chancellor of the university of Wales. Professor Thomas, who was a professor in physical chemistry at Aberystwyth and Cambridge universities, dealt in his article with the way in which funding in science has been cut. The department of chemistry at Aberystwyth has now, sadly, been rationalised out of existence. That shows the priority that the Government give to science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article summarises the proportion of wealth that is devoted to education. In 1979, it was 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 4.8 per cent now. In contrast—and I find this quite incredible—the amount of money devoted to publicity and information in the Department of Education and Science has risen from £226,000 in 1979 to £6.48 million last year. That is 28 times as much as the 1979 figure and shows that the Government are interested only in propaganda, misinformation and half-truths. They are spending less on education than they did 10 or 12 years ago. The present generation of students, and the long-term prosperity of Britain, will suffer as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

serious problems facing Welsh higher education. My hon. Friend has always been a doughty fighter for education in Dyfed and in the Camarthen area. I must say that I was grieved to hear the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) growling like a toothless bull dog without once mentioning the 12 and a half years of deprivation in education in the Principality. Our schools are falling apart, our higher education is cut, but the hon. Gentleman, thrown a crumb by the Secretary of State about the use of the Welsh language—which all hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not take that point of view, and it ill becomes the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sorry to read recently a WDA publication called "Welsh Developments", which referred only to the excellence of University College and Imperial College and the aid and co-operation that those institutions are giving to Welsh industry. The polytechnic of Wales is also doing excellent work. I am glad that the Secretary of State is nodding his head. The polytechnic has co-operated with industry to attract inward investment and has provided that investment with tremendous services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The range of services that is offered by the polytechnic should be examined carefully by the Welsh Office and strengthened in every way possible. The polytechnic occupies a unique role within the educational and industrial infrastructure in Wales. Those of us who grew up in south Wales have a great deal of affection for the polytechnic—the Treforest school of mines as it once was. Local authorities such as Glamorgan and Mid-Glamorgan have put scarce resources into building up the school of mines and the technical college into the institution that it now is. I hope that, as a transition is perhaps made into university status, that contribution will be remembered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It worries me a little that it is assumed that the polytechnic will have a great new life and move up from the second division into the first. The school of mines was a pioneering institution and the polytechnic has
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
been a pioneering institution in many ways. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) was chairman of the board of governors of the polytechnic and he knows, as do other right hon. and hon. Members, of the work that has been done by the polytechnic. It has special skills and links with the community and industry. I hope that the aspirations to university status—we cannot blame the administration for having them—will not detract from the nature of polytechnic education. That is the multi-skills approach with a broad spectrum of courses, not just academic, which is needed to transform an economy that is itself undergoing transformation. That will help to attract inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next generation of inward investment will be attracted by a skilled and educated work force. It will not be attracted by a low-wage economy as it has been in the past. I am not knocking previous inward investment because I am glad that it came to Wales. However, in a free market, the new inward investment will be more difficult to attract. To create those jobs with added value, we must have the best educated work force in Europe. The polytechnic has a great part to play in that. I hope that the Minister will address that in his summing-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Welsh Office will also address the problem of student accommodation that arises when student numbers are increased. Although I am glad that the numbers have risen, some areas of Pontypridd have become swamped with students. Local residents cannot afford to buy houses and the sons and daughters of families who have been there for many generations have to move away. Estate agents have been buying dwellings as investments and turning them into multi-occupancy houses. I hope that any future announcement of an expansion in student numbers will be accompanied by an announcement of an expansion in purpose-built student accommodation so that local communities are not swamped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again apologise for this morning. I was away on other parliamentary business. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) made a special plea for the polytechnic of Wales. As he said, I was chairman of the polytechnic's governors for eight years during a period of considerable expansion. One of the poorest—in rateable value terms—county councils made a tremendous contribution to the development of that institution from being a technical college—the school of mines—to being a polytechnic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am at odds with my party's policy of destroying the binary system. There is a place for technical institutions and polytechnics that have a direct link to communities and industry. I am sad that the pretension, as it sometimes is, of being called a university appeals to an institution that is so rooted in the working-class communities of south Wales and the contributions made to it by those people. However, if those strong links are maintained, perhaps my fears will prove to be unfounded.

Perhaps fortunately, I was not here for whatever was said about the Welsh language earlier. However, the

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), and others of his party, should realise that Labour authorities have done far more for the Welsh language than many authorities in Welsh-speaking areas that tend to support his party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As vice-chairman of the Mid Glamorgan education committee and a member of the old Glamorgan county council, I was responsible for the change from Glamorgan to Mid Glamorgan. We drew up a Welsh language policy to develop primary and secondary schools. I pay tribute to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) who as Secretary of State for Wales made a great contribution to the Welsh language. Lord Heycock more than anyone else single-handedly saved the Welsh language through his drive on the Welsh Joint Education Committee. There was also the setting up of the Welsh national language unit at the polytechnic of Wales. Time and again, Conservative Members say that the initiatives come from the Welsh Office. All the good ideas and initiatives have come from local authorities, of all political complexions, in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that my constituency has made a great contribution to education in Wales. Some Welsh leaders have come from the Rhondda valley. I am not looking for votes. I and my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend gets paranoid about his 28,000 majority and is jealous of my 31,000 majority. People vote for us in such numbers because of their education, breeding and background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour authorities have made a great contribution over the years. Those of us who support and advocate the Welsh language believe that it must develop through mutual trust among the Welsh people. It must develop among English speakers. It is easy for people from Welsh families to speak Welsh. I have three grandchildren whose first language is Welsh. It is easy for them to speak Welsh. They say, "Rhaid i ni siarad Saesneg for you, Grandpa". I laugh, but I know it is their language. It is easy for them but difficult for people in the valleys. It comes back to adult education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was district secretary of the Workers Educational Association in Wales, it embarked on a programme of courses in Welsh language and culture. The Welsh Office gave us substantial funds. The development of Welsh language classes for adults spread. There is a great desire to develop the language, but that can be done only with the support and will of the English-speaking community. Any political party that uses the Welsh language as a football does a disservice to the language and culture of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee. I dissent from nothing that the hon. Gentleman has said. I pay tribute to him for having in the past gone on record as saying that the Welsh language belongs to everyone in Wales, Welsh and English speakers alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman accept that, notwithstanding people like Lord Heycock, who did excellent work
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
in the old Glamorgan county council, Welsh language education provision is lacking in some areas of Wales? For example, the provision in West Glamorgan is way behind that in Mid or South Glamorgan. There needs to be provision in all parts of Wales to give people the opportunity to learn the language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is enormously difficult for under-resourced local authorities to withstand the pressures from the majority English-speaking constituents, who want nursery education, development of mathematics education and new laboratories for science education, and say that instead they will build new Welsh primary and secondary schools. It is a dilemma. But if the resources are provided to make it a valid proposition, I support it. I would like to see the language taken out of the political arena.

You have been very kind, Mr. Hughes, in calling me at this late stage in our proceedings. I should like to make one further point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not here. Oh yes he is; he is a good lad. Will the right hon. Gentleman please take in hand the problem that faces Mid Glamorgan county council? The total cost to Mid Glamorgan of the teachers' pay award—and we all applaud the fact that the award has been made—will be £1.7 million. The Government are giving Mid Glamorgan £700,000. So the council must find £1 million to fund the teachers' award. To do that, it will face rate capping—or, perhaps, poll tax capping. The Secretary of State is an expert on the poll tax. Indeed, he is its grand architect. Can he tell the people of Mid Glamorgan how to get out of that dilemma? How can they pay for the teachers' pay award without the council cutting services or being rate-capped? What can they do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially interested in the outstanding speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) in which he outlined the way that the Welsh people have treated education over the past century. There is no doubt that the people of north, mid and south Wales pay great attention to the education of their young men and women. My hon. Friend did both the Committee and Wales a service by highlighting that commitment to education. That is why the Opposition are so concerned about what has occurred in Wales over the past 13 years. There is a record of neglect and of dogma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Secretary of State for Education and Science and other Conservative Members talk about what has gone wrong with education in Wales and elsewhere over the past decade or two, they forget that they have been the Government for 13 years. They should have been putting right what was evidently wrong in education. All the so-called reforms that we have witnessed in education since 1979 have been based on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
nothing more than right-wing ideology that has been imposed upon the people of Wales who clearly do not like it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), for Merthyr Tydfil and Ryhmney and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) mentioned nursery and pre-school education. The Secretary of State made a brief reference to it. Every member of the Committee must know that the quality of nursery education in the Principality has been maintained at a high level simply because the local education authorities in Wales—most of which are Labour—have had the highest possible record of achievement on pre-school education. The irony is that when I was a child of four or five, some 40 years ago, the possibility of nursery education was far from being a dream. But there are parts of Wales now where there are difficulties in providing that form of education. Any educationist will confirm that nursery education is of the greatest significance when it comes to the development of a human being. That is why we repeat the commitment that a Labour Government will give a pledge to every parent of a three or four-year-old that they will have that nursery education if they require it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon.

In others where it is lower, money could be saved on a number of schemes for which the people of Wales had little interest, such as the assisted places scheme. It could be put to better use in nursery education. My hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth, for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams), who represent Gwent, Mid Glamorgan and Dyfed have emphasised the decline in our crumbling schools and the lack of books and equipment. It has been a sorry tale of rundown, begging, borrowing and neglect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The review of educational provision was embargoed until half-past 10 which has prevented us from reading it. We are all busy and my hon. Friend may not have had time to go through it yet. I have got to page 5 and have found 21 critical comments by the inspectorate, most of which refer to the problems that my hon. Friend has just described. That is the Government's own document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State accepted that HMI in Wales, even before it is to be privatised, is of the highest possible professional calibre. Paragraph 30 of the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Few schools in Wales do not have some signs of neglect. Poor maintenance of the fabric and poor external decoration are frequent causes for concern; leaking roofs are a common problem, in some cases despite recent treatment."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of nine secondary reports published in 1990–91, only three did not refer to deficiencies in the fabric of buildings and five mentioned leaking roofs. Among the 45 primary reports, 25 remarked upon evidence of deterioration and 11 referred to leaking roofs."</p></blockquote>
That is a sorry and disgraceful state for our Welsh schools to be in in 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989, another HMI report complained of poor laboratories and workshops in Welsh secondary schools. Everyone knows that there is a desperate need for scientists, technicians and technologists. My hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen rightly pointed out that according to an independent report, one third of all money spent on primary school books and equipment in Wales comes from the parents of the children who attend those schools. That, too, is a disgrace for our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the right hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), who preceded him in office, made great reference to the valleys initiative. But one could search high and low in vain in the initiative documents to discover what they propose to do about the crumbling schools in the valleys of south Wales. Hundreds of them built before the first world war are in desperate need of attention. In 1992, there is no excuse for schools to have outside toilets. A future Labour Government are committed to ensuring that such neglect shall cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh local authorities have been starved of cash for the everyday running of schools as well as for capital expenditure. Since my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) was Secretary of State for Wales, we have lost more than £1 billion in revenue and rate support grant, much of which would have gone into the coffers of our local education authorities and been used to improve our education system. The latest gimmick and bribe by the Government of an increase in teachers' pay will do nothing to detract from the fact that the majority of teachers in Wales know where the blame lies for the deficiencies in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past two or three years, the poll tax disaster and fiasco has cost the people of Wales £100 million which could better have been spent on our schools and children. The Government must face that disgrace in the forthcoming general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office has plunged our local education authorities into chaos, not merely because of local government finance but because of the dogmatic rubbish that has been imposed on the people of Wales in the past 13 years. The Government have introduced local management of schools and, of course, many of us agree with the idea of greater independence for schools. But the independent, impartial and professional inspectorate in Wales states in paragraph 9 of the HMI review:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nonetheless, concerns persist in many schools about the adequacy of funds allocated through the application of the"—</p></blockquote>
LMS—
	<br><blockquote><p>"formula, the possible detrimental effects upon staffing levels, the burden of administraton, and the continuity of valuable services, such as peripatetic Welsh and music teachers."</p></blockquote>
Even the inspectorate says that the formula is totally inadequate for our primary and secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
With regard to the provision of special educatin for our disabled children, the introduction of LMS is dotty. The Government have introduced a national curriculum without proper resources and it has taken up an enormous amount of teachers' classroom time. They have brought in compulsory teaching of the Welsh language, but the county of Gwent never taught Welsh as a compulsory subject and, obviously, it will be expensive for the local education authority to train and employ new teachers for that. Gwent has said that it wants a specific grant for the teaching of Welsh in that county, but the Welsh Office has underfunded the compulsory teaching of the language by hundreds of thousands of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced proposals for the assessment of pupils which are far too rigid and inflexible. A primary school head teacher in my constituency recently wrote to me saying that they take up far too much valuable teaching time and serve very little purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the worst disaster resulting from the new changes and so-called reforms is the question of the grant-maintained or opt-out schools. In earlier exchanges with my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), the Secretary of State referred to Gwent. I have no doubt that the reason why Cwmcarn and Brynmawr comprehensive schools have been allowed to opt out is that the Government want to use them for their electoral advantage. There is no doubt that the secondary school reorganisation which the Welsh Office is pressing on Gwent to reduce surplus places cannot work unless there is a proper scheme. But the Secretary of State has deliberately turned down such schemes so that he can say to the Prime Minister, "Here are a couple of schools in Wales which have opted for grant-maintained status". Those schools would not have wanted to go for that status if they did not fear closure under secondary school reorganisation. The director of education in Gwent said that the authority's entire secondary school reorganisation plan has been thrown into total disarray and that the Secretary of State has
	<br><blockquote><p>"frustrated the authority's earnest endeavour to address the very problem which he has himself called upon Gwent to tackle—such a decision could not be in the public interest."</p></blockquote>
Worse would come if the Tories, by some mischance, won the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government promised us league tables. I thought that the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan), who spoke earlier, was winding up for the Opposition, because his comments made great sense. League tables will create great practical problems. The viability of our schools will depend on the number of pupils that they can attract, and pupils will be seen as nothing more than a financial resource. Teaching will be geared to tests and the inspectorate will be drawn into an appalling market place. One hon. Member after another has rightly referred to the disgraceful privatisation of the inspectorate, which will take place if the Government are returned to office.

I have no doubt that schools will be constrained by LMS, as they have been by the cuts that have occurred over the past few years, and will go for the cheapest and
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
least stringent inspectors. That is inevitable. The only way to maintain the professionalism, independence and integrity of our inspectorate—which has been shown to have reached its highest level for almost 80 years—is to ensure that the 59 inspectors in Wales, and the local education authorities, come under the umbrella of an education standards commission for Wales. Such a body, which is proposed by the Labour party, would be independent and accountable to the House and to the Welsh Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also plan to change the nature of further and higher education in Wales. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) is not in Committee at present, but earlier he made some rather silly comments about the benefits of the Bill. I am sure that he, other members of his party and other hon. Members would agree that adult education will inevitably be put at risk by the provisions in the Further and Higher Education Bill. No other part of Great Britain owes more than the Principality to adult education—we have benefited from Coleg Harlech, the Welsh Educational Association and other institutions. The artificial distinction between leisure and vocation in adult education cannot possibly be maintained. That is why we will fight the Further and Higher Education Bill line by line in Committee in the next two weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State urges local education authorities to reorganise and reduce surplus places. How can they reorganise under a tertiary system of education if LEAs control schools and the Welsh Office controls colleges? That is simply not workable. The most humanly tragic result of the Government's higher education policies is the terrible state into which many students have been plunged, not only in Wales, but throughout Britain. Grants have been frozen and student loans—which we opposed—introduced. The Government have cut social security payments to students in the vacation, which has meant misery and penury for thousands of young Welsh men and women. It is estimated that of the 3,000 students in Gwent, 10 per cent are suffering from severe financial hardship. Another pledge from Labour: we will abolish student loans when we enter office in a few months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's education policy in Wales has been cosmetic, populist and dangerous. They have reduced our schools to nothing more than businesses in a harsh and competitive world and they are planning further changes that are even more bizarre and eccentric that those of the past few years. They will make the morale of our teachers even lower—if that is possible. They have created an educational jungle in Wales and their neglect, underfunding and dogma has meant that their so-called choice has become utterly meaningless in valleys and rural parts of Wales. Welsh education yearns for stability and commitment. I believe that a Labour Government will provide both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several issues have received a good airing today: parts of the debate have been extremely good. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State opened the debate by setting out the Government's achievements across the spectrum of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
education in Wales. His speech provided a first-class record of success in pursuit of better educational standards across the board. I was glad to see that some Opposition Members seemed to appreciate the improvements that have been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of education in Wales is reflected in the latest education statistics bulletin issued recently, which shows that 70 per cent of our three and four-year-olds are receiving pre-school education. Compared with England, that is an extremely high proportion. About 40 per cent of school leavers are continuing with further or higher education. Again, that is up on previous years. A fifth of school leavers have at least one A-level and about half of those sitting GCSE under Welsh Joint Education Committee examinations are getting grade C or better. Apparently, there is record high spending per pupil in primary and secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) are worried about children who leave school without qualifications. In 1989–90, 14 per cent of all pupils left school in Wales without GCE or GCSE qualifications, although 8 per cent attained at least one other recognised qualification. However in 1979–80, 25 per cent of pupils in Wales left school without GCE, A-level, O-level, CSE or GCES qualifications. So there has been a significant improvement during the life of this Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) told us that the Labour party proposes to ensure that there are no primary school classes of more than 40 children and to establish a maximum class size. In Wales, our record is good. Only nine primary classes out of a total of 9,596 have more than 40 pupils; 82 per cent of classses have 30 pupils or fewer. I hope that Opposition Members will acknowledge that the situation in Wales is not as black as is sometimes painted by their colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a great deal about crumbling schools. The hon. Members for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams), for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) spoke of the small number of children who still have to use outside toilets. That is because local education authorities have chosen to use the resources provided for other things. I have said many a time and oft that they prefer to build their Taj Mahals—their county halls—than to spend the money on schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the facts. In the past three years local authorities have chosen to given higher priority to other services than to education. In that period we have provided £185 million to education capital spending. The latest forecast of expenditure to the end of 1991–92 suggests that local education authorities will have underspent the provision by more than £14 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members delight in telling us what they propose to do: I shall tell the Committee what we have done. In 1979–80, provision for capital expenditure on education was £24.1 million. For this year it is £66.6 million, which represents a 19 per cent increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can speak from experience only. In Mid-Glamorgan, which has a high percentage of old
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
schools, the authorities had, until recent years, an outside toilet rebuilding or replacement programme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said, they do not have a Taj Mahal or anything like that, yet they do not have the resources to rebuild dilapidated schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the hon. Gentleman the overall figures. I am sure that if we broke them down by county it would show the increase in the money that we have provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's HMI report points out that there is still a great deal to be done to identify more precisely the learning difficulties of pupils with special educational needs. That subject has been raised by hon. Members in this debate. The day-to-day responsibility for making provision for children with special educational needs, as with the rest of education, rests with local education authorities. The Government are committed to equal oportunities for those with special education needs. With that in mind, the Welsh Office is committing resources to improving provision for those with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant support has been made available to LEAs under the Grants for Educational Support and Training Programme—the GEST programme—to support the training of teachers of children with special educational needs. We have just announced that for next year almost £1 million will be available to support the training of teachers of the deaf, the blind, those with severe learning difficulties and those teachers in ordinary schools with SEN responsibility. The grant will also support the initial training of educational psychologists and a regional resource for those children who are both deaf and blind. I am sure that that will be welcomed by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. The Welsh Office has also allocated resources to pre-school playgroups to help them develop a training programme for personnel involved in the process of integrating children with special educational needs into local playgroups. We also intend to ensure that education will have a sharper focus in our plans for the future of the All Wales Mental Handicap Strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to do their best for those with special needs and for their parents who often have to cope with difficult procedures on top of the child's learning difficulties. We have issued guidance to LEAs which advocates completion of the statementing process within six months, and the maximum assistance for parents, including the use of plain, jargon-free language. We shall be following the charter for parents in Wales with a guide for parents of children with special educational needs, which will be issued within the next few weeks. The bilingual guide will explain how parents can go about ensuring that their children get all the help and support that they require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of special needs education, what the Minister has just said sounds good,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
except that, as I understand it, the part-time special needs M. Ed course that teachers can take in the evenings and with occasional day release at Cardiff university education department is shortly to close and Caerleon will be the only place that teachers can attend. That is not accessible to those teachers in work who want to attain a masters degree while pursuing their careers because Caerleon is too far to the east. Cardiff is nicely centrally located for those teachers who want to study part-time while working. Can the Minister confirm that that course is to close?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot confirm that. It is up to the institutions themselves to arrange their courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also had much huffing and puffing from Opposition Members about the role of HMI and the new arrangements for the inspection of schools. The Education (Schools) Bill, which is currently before Parliament, establishes a separate and independent office of Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools in Wales—a Department of State in its own right with the new chief inspector being appointed by the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen referred to HMI being responsible to his educational standards commissioner. In other words, there is not the degree of independence that we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the role of HMCI and his or her staff will be to give the Secretary of State impartial advice—HMCI will be no one's puppet—on the quality of education and educational standards in schools in Wales. The other part of HMCI's role will be the equally important responsibility of overseeing and regulating the new independent inspection system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
The new arrangements will enable inspection, leading to a published report, of a much larger number of schools on a more frequent basis than at present. HMI is simply not geared to carry out inspections on the scale that we envisage under the new arrangements. Last year HMI visited over half of the educational establishments in Wales, but undertook only 113 formal inspections and surveys leading to published reports. Only 55 institutions had published inspection reports. That is the fault not of HMI but of the present system. Depending on what we decide about the frequency of inspections in Wales, the new arrangements will mean inspections of 400 or 500 schools a year, with published reports and action plans for schools to follow.

The Opposition chose today's subject for debate, but perhaps they had already read what 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> said about their policies in its supplement last Sunday:
