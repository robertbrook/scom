Education Standards in Wales</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recollect that debate on the motion before it at the previous sitting was interrupted at 1 o'clock. Before we can move on to the debate scheduled for today, we must dispose of the Question currently before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of Education Standards in Wales.—<i>[Mr. Redwood.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE IN WALES</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Redwood)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of health and health care in Wales.</p></blockquote>
It is a great birthday treat for me to have the opportunity to debate health in Wales this morning and local government in Wales in the Chamber this afternoon. What better birthday present could there possibly be for a Secretary of State for Wales? I am sure that hon. Members will enter into the spirit of this morning's proceedings in the traditional way.<br><br>
My one regret has been to discover that a mistake has been made and Scottish water is being served in Committee. I trust that, in future, we can have good Brecon water or some other excellent brand of Welsh water. We are proud of our water in Wales and would like to drink it to loosen our tongues for this crucial debate on health care.<br><br>
First the good news—the news that the Opposition will seek to bury or deny this morning. For the first time we have delivered the patient charter guarantees for better and prompt treatment. For the first time no patient is waiting more than two years to receive non-urgent treatment, and nor should he. For the first time, no hip replacement, knee replacement or cataract removal patient is waiting more than 18 months for the operation, and nor should he. All urgent treatment is provided within one month and emergency treatment is, of course, supplied on demand. All those guarantees are being fully met and most patients are treated well within those limits.<br><br>
We are also beginning to see the tide turn on the increase in waiting lists and on waiting times for people who have been referred to a hospital consultant by their general practitioner. In the six months to March 1994, the out-patient list was reduced by 4,100, which is a 3 per cent. reduction. I am also pleased to announce today that the number of people waiting over three months for their appointments fell even more sharply, by nearly 10,000, which is a 15 per cent. reduction. That is a significant and most welcome trend that I wish to see continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of, State for giving those figures to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
Committee. I believe that the then Under-Secretary of State for Wales first gave an undertaking on in-patient treatment in 1988, saying that the targets would be achieved in two years, not six years. Will the Secretary of State admit that the fact that the Welsh Office—under pressure from the Opposition—is now seeking to bring in guarantees on the length of wait for first consultation shows that the figures on the length of wait for in-patient treatment are the most open to manipulation of all health service statistics? It is easy to delay a first visit to a consultant until that consultant can guarantee treatment within the maximum waiting time set out in the patients charter. Will the right hon. Gentleman therefore agree that the figures that he has announced do not represent an achievement, but an admission that the figures are widely open to manipulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree. It is a real achievement and most welcome to those many people who have received treatment without having to wait as long as people did in the 1970s and early 1980s. I do not know what the then Under-Secretary of State for Wales said, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but I do know that most people are extremely pleased that we have now hit the targets, and they will be even more pleased that I intend to tighten the targets further and to address the specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I have already announced that, from 1 April 1995, the maximum waiting times will be guaranteed for new referrals and will be measured from the date the patient's GP first sees the patient and agrees that something needs doing. That is another extremely welcome improvement in the guarantees that we offer patients and it directly answers the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. It represents a tightening of the target and a further improvement in the standards of service. It brings the time taken to be seen as an out-patient at a hospital within the measurement of total waiting time. A separate standard of a maximum six-month wait for the first out-patient appointment will still apply. The existing guarantee for uergent treatment will, of course, be retained.<br><br>
The guarantee in Wales will be the best in the United Kingdom, so let us have some support from Opposition Members for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State, in addressing the issue of urgent treatment, answer the point made in "Protocol for Investment in Health Gain", which was published by the Welsh Office in 1992. Paragraph 268 of that document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Royal College of Surgeons report suggested that up to 30 per cent. of seriously injured patients who die following admission to A&E do so from potentially treatable causes."</p></blockquote>
What does the Secretary of State plan to do about that in Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The intention is clear that the ambulance should pick up the accident victim as quickly as possible, and we have set out demanding times that must be met for rapid transfer of the victim to the right place. Of course, victims' injuries are usually assessed from the moment that the ambulance crew first make contact. Once the injured person is in hospital, he or she will be given the best possible medical care.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0192">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
Government policy is that people should have immediate access to the best possible medical care available. That is the intention and I trust that all hospitals will carry out that policy. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with that policy.<br><br>
Our success in improving timeliness of treatment should be set beside the undoubted success in treating ever more patients. In the past year an estimated 712,200 people have been treated as in-patients and day cases and 609,800 treated as out-patients—increases of 6.6 per cent. and 4.6 per cent. respectively over the previous year. Those figures paint a picture of a growing service, which is doing ever more for the people of Wales. That sort of picture is never painted by Opposition Members.<br><br>
New treatments and techniques recently introduced include minimally invasive therapy and patient-controlled analgesia. New and improved hospitals have been opened such as Gwynedd phase II, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd phase II and Brecon War Memorial, and we will soon see the benefits from the new burns and plastic surgery development at Morriston, the new cancer treatment centre at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and the regional blood transfusion centre at Ynys-y-Plwm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I raise the individual case of Miss Vicky Rimmer, who lies desperately ill in Wrexham Maelor trust hospital? She is, I think, 16 years old and a pupil at Hawarden high school. She is being well care for by the medical staff, but it is believed that she suffers from Creutzfeld Jacobs disease—the human form of the disease usually called mad cow disease.<br><br>
I have informed the office of the Secretary of State that a great deal of distress was caused to the family of Vicky Rimmer—particularly to Mrs. Beryl Rimmer, who looks after her—when a press statement was made by the hospital, without any reference to the family. The consequences of that have been that the family has been upset and concern has spread throughout the community.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State look into the circumstances surrounding the press release? Will he guarantee me some form of report that I may give to Mrs. Beryl Rimmer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My sympathy, along with the hon. Gentleman's goes to the family and the patient concerned. It is our policy that she should get the best possible medical care, and I am delighted to hear his reassurance that that is happening. We hope that progress will be made for that patient. I am very sorry if a press release caused distress. I shall look into that and come back to the hon. Gentleman in the way that he requested. It was not my intention to cause such distress. It is usually better not to comment on individual cases but to consider them after the problem has been sorted out.<br><br>
General practitioners are improving their quality of service and there has been an expansion of preventive medicine. In 1992–93, 262,319 women in Wales had cervical smear tests, 7,000 more than the previous year. The proportion of children under two years of age being immunised also increased: 96 per cent. were immunised against diphtheria, polio and tetanus, up 2 per cent.; 9 per cent. against measles, again up 2 per cent; and 88 per cent. against whooping cough, an increase of a full 4 per cent. on the previous year. Prevention is better than cure.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The health service is not just a sickness service but is a wider health service offering people support and advice on how to sustain or improve their health.<br><br>
The burden of the Opposition's tack today will be the usual one—that there is not enough money. For this year, I announced to Parliament a massive increase of £100 million, or more than 5 per cent. in the amount of money going to the health service in Wales compared with the previous year. I want all that cash to be used for the benefit of the patient. Within that sum, I have provided more than £40 million for the primary health-care services provided by GPs, general dental practitioners, opticians and pharmacists. More than £56 million has been provided to health authorities. That will secure a significant increase in the number of patients treated and in the quality of health care provided to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State tell us whether he will examine the practice of fundholding? Small GP practices in communities represented by myself and others often believe that they are being discriminated against because fundholders have special access to hospitals. That will result in a two-class system of patients—those who are covered by fundholding practices and those who are not, either through GP choice or because the type of practice has the ability to become fundholding. Will he ensure that no such discrimination takes place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want a two-tier service and that is not the intention of our policies. Smaller GP practices can get together if they believe that fundholding would greatly advantage them and their patients. We are very happy to offer advice and assistance to GPs in the constituency of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) if he wants.<br><br>
Let me explain to the hon. Gentleman why it is not our intention or aim to create a two-tier service. There are high minimum standards of care for everyone in Wales, whether he or she goes to a fundholder or a GP under the more traditional arrangements. The same high minimum standards of service should be available at whichever hospital a patient may attend. But we like to make progress, we like innovation and we like to use the skills of doctors to the best effect. If there are doctors, as there clearly are, who think that they could make a better job of running their own affairs more directly, we are happy to trust them and give them that independence. Their patients are on the whole very satisfied with that approach and it has undoubtedly produced good results. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider that with the GPs in his area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there are such obvious advantages, will the Secretary of State tell the Committee what percentage of doctors have taken up the option of fundholding in Wales, especially in constituencies such as mine with high morbidity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: About a third of patients in Wales are covered by GP fundholders and we anticipate that next year it will be 40 per cent., so there has been a steady increase. We are offering doctors a freedom. It is good that that many patients are covered by the improved services. But if one believes in choice, one must accept that some people want fundholding and some do not.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend share my disappointment at the resistance of Opposition Members to the very clear advantages that come to fundholding GPs? Is not that disappointment underlined by the fact that it is anticipated that by 1996 all practices in Powys will be fundholding, including two run by doctors who are prominent supporters of the Labour party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) is muddling the choices. We are allowing doctors to choose how they can best look after their patients. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and I am sure that patients in my hon. Friend's constituency would agree that services have been improved as a result of the changes above the acceptable level that already existed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has condemned himself from his own mouth. He confirmed that what my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said was true. If there are advantages to fundholding, there must also be disadvantages for doctors who are not fundholders who, at least, will remain at the same level. The Government are creating a two-tier system of those who have and those who do not have those advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that Opposition Members do not like choice and do not understand human nature. I believe that the majority of doctors probably could provide an even better service given the extra freedom, but I shall leave it to them to decide. Many doctors are already doing that, but it is conceivable that some would be unable to provide a better service, and that is why we are introducing an element of choice.<br><br>
I should like to return to talking about the advantages of the extra £100 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not to the hon. Gentleman because he is extremely discourteous to me and was so again this morning on the radio.<br><br>
The extra money will reduce waiting lists and serve to introduce new patients charter guarantees on total waiting times. It will also support the employment of a significant level of additional doctors and nurses and ensure improved levels of education and training for all NHS staff. The remaining £4 million has been provided to support the resettlement into the community of long-stay mental handicap patients and to provide other vulnerable members of our society with free milk and vitamin tablets. In prescribing that the funding must be used in those ways, I have helped to ensure a resolution of the problems that hospitals and surgeries have experienced in the past as a result of top slicing—deciding centrally where money will go and taking it away to be used in the Welsh Office, the Welsh Health Common Services Authority and the district health authorities, rather than allowing it to filter down to the people providing patient care. I announced some time ago a change in policy; not top slicing, but slicing the top. I should like to report to the Committee today on the progress that I have made.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Good housekeeping begins at home. I have, therefore, decided not to have two senior posts at the top of the health service in Wales but to amalgamate the post of director of the NHS Wales with a senior civil service position. That has now been done. The amalgamation of the NHS directorate with the Welsh Office health policy staff has enabled me to reduce the number of posts and the overhead costs by about 15 per cent.—a reduction of 30 posts. That is a clear signal to the rest of the health service in Wales that I am serious in wishing to control the administrative overhead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State knows that there is currently considerable controversy in England about whether members of the Opposition Front Bench with responsibility for health are permitted by the changes in the British constitution to meet the director of the NHS in England, Alan Langlands. The holder of the equivalent post in Wales would have been John Wyn Owen, who is now merged within the Welsh Office. Has the Secretary of State given any thought to whether members of the Opposition Front Bench with responsibility for health, such as the shadow Secretary of State and myself, would be permitted to meet Peter Gregory, who is the director of the NHS in Wales, as well as director of NHS policy in the Welsh Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should consult my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health before responding to the hon. Gentleman's question. I shall let the hon. Gentleman know whether that would be possible under the rules that commonly apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And make them up as you go along.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being extremely unhelpful. I shall see whether I can be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, but I need to consult colleagues. I shall come back to him on that basis. He will know that I am normally generous in ensuring that Opposition spokesmen are properly briefed when they ask for such consultation to take place.<br><br>
I wish to see health authorities reduce their headquarters staff to a maximum of 50 for so-called commissioning purposes. Some authorities are already below that figure, and I am not keen for them to increase up to it. In addition, all authorities should limit their non-commissioning staff to the absolute minimum needed to carry out statutory responsibilities. I wish firmly to put that on the record again. The policy is clean district health authorities should cut their commissioning staffs until they are around the 50-post average. They should do that in preparation for geographical amalgamation and merger with the FHSAs.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and I hope to bring to Parliament legislative proposals to consolidate the work that we are doing on merging health authorities. In the meantime, I wish to see more joint work undertaken between DHAs and FHSAs. By 30 June, I expect to have received the consultation replies to my proposals for reducing the number of DHAs. I shall consider them carefully. Of course, I am open to persuasion, but my inclination is for a significant reduction in the present number—17 authorities—preferably to fewer than eight authorities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
We have offered for consideration a radical reduction to only three authorities, which would have many advantages. The scope for savings would be substantial. The case seems particualrly strong in respect of the two south-west Wales authorities and would reduce the number of authorities from nine to eight. There is also a good case for joint working and preparation between FHSAs and DHAs where that is not already occurring.<br><br>
There have been comments about the approach in England compared with that which I have adopted in Wales. So the Committee might like to hear what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health said outside the House of Commons in a recent speech, in which she made it clear that we have a common interest and a common policy in keeping control of administrative costs.<br><br>
She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is always the tendency for bureaucracies to multiply in size unless firmly checked…NHS Executive figures in England suggest considerable variations between Trusts in management costs … The public have a strong and legitimate interest in the size of those management costs.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Government is undertaking a radical reduction in the layers of NHS administration. We propose to abolish the regional health authorities and allow district and family health services authorities to merge. The NHS Executive will be slimmed down. We are examining the Department of Health itself to ensure that our administation is appropriate to the task it has to discharge without becoming cumbersome.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I expect to see less bureaucracy and less paperwork at every level and more spent on patients."</p></blockquote>
The message from both of us is the same: good management is essential, but there can be too much of a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State know that I sent him a lengthy document as a contribution towards this debate? As yet, he has not answered the questions that I set out in it. We all support his desire to reduce bureacracy in the health service; will he tell us by how much the bureaucracy in the Welsh Office health division will be reduced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just done that. I said that we were reducing it by 15 per cent. or 30 posts. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that lead from the centre.<br><br>
By far the largest block of staff at the centre of the health service is employed by the Welsh Health Common Services Authority. I can no longer support a system in which 1,750 people are employed in that operation at the centre. I have pleasure in announcing my proposals for the authority. For all its non-clinical functions, including purchasing, prescription pricing, estate management and supplies, I intend to implement a vigorous policy of market testing. I wish the trusts to be free to buy the facilities and services that they need.<br><br>
I hope that the managers in the Common Services Authority will propose plans to take themselves into the private sector, where they can compete against others to offer the best possible quality and lowest possible price for those services that the health servive still needs. In a world in which trusts are doing more for themselves, we should not second-guess them or double-bank the activities through a central Common Services Authority.<br><br>
Many trusts will find it better to deal directly with suppliers. The residual tasks to negotiate some central
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
contracts to maximise the discounts that trusts enjoy does not require the present number of staff that the authority employs. The clinical activities of the authority, which are important, will become part of the mainstream NHS and the remaining activities will be market tested.<br><br>
I have imposed a recruitment freeze on administrative and clerical staff in all central units and managed hospitals. It is necessary to offset the increased number of administrative staff required in the trusts. The proposals that I have announced today go further and start to make a good impact on the total number employed as the Common Service Authority reforms go through.<br><br>
Since introducing a specific ban on replacement or recruitment for administrative staff in DHAs and the Common Services Authority, I have received requests to approve 20 places for staff not assisting directly with patient care. I have rejected eight. That means that natural wastage has reduced the staff by the equivalent of 61 whole-time jobs to compensate for the increase in trust staff over that period as 24 new trusts have been set up.<br><br>
I am also announcing an initiative to put more clinical staff back on to the wards. As part of the slimming-down exercise in health authorities, together with efforts being made by trusts, there will be an opportunity, for example, for nurses to return to clinical work on the wards and possibly in surgeries. I want to encourage that and I suggest that employers use the clinical trading structure to allow such staff to return to clinical work, possibly on protected salaries. That would give the nurses concerned the opportunity to use their professional skills again and enable hospitals to make better use of staff overall. The same principles would apply to other professional staff. I hope that that will include nurse lecturers in nursing colleges where there are too many staff. I am not discouraging doctors or nurses from entering management—far from it. I am very much in favour of that, but I am encouraging those who wish to return to clinical work when, as a result of slimming down, there is no management job to be done. My Department will be pursuing that actively with employers.<br><br>
I am continuing my initiative to reduce the amount of paperwork and bumf in the health service. We reviewed the 106 financial and statistical forms sent out to hospitals and cut them by one third, or by 35 forms. We have also made reductions in the size and complexity of many of the remainder. Much of the information previously collected centrally is no longer needed by the Welsh Office in the light of the reforms. Information on the day-to-day running of the hospitals is a matter for the hospitals and not for central Government. I need to know and to report to Parliament on the total money spent and the overall achievement of the system. The sort of forms that have been discontinued include those that collect information on fixed assets in land, buildings and equipment, details of the number of each ambulance crew sent out on specific jobs, details by speciality of the number of patients who return briefly to have dressings changed, the pathology workload in hospital laboratories and the work of opticians who visit hospitals to prescribe glasses to patients after eye operations. I am sure that the health service will welcome that clean out of unnecessary information requirements.<br><br>
I am also concerned about the amount of paperwork which GPs are expected to complete. Some of it will be inescapable in the interests of properly accounting for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
their time and costs, but GPs are busy people whose primary focus rightly has to be on the treatment of patients. I expect health authorities to recognise that and to take whatever steps are available to relieve the administrative burden. The Welsh Office is playing a crucial part in pushing ahead with that with the joint England and Wales programme to link GPs with the FHSAs by computer. That will enable many of the authorities' needs to be satisfied, reducing the need for flows of paper and special form filling between the two. I want to send an ever clearer message that it is patient care rather than paperwork that should take priority.<br><br>
The "Caring for the Future" policy which I set out a couple of months ago is an action plan for three years. The central point is that quality should be the prime consideration in all the work of the NHS in Wales. Patients are to be well informed of hospital waiting lists and where they can best obtain the surgery that they need in a timely way. The waiting time information bulletin is being revised to cover more medical procedures and will be made directly available to the public as well as to their general practitioners, who will usually advise and guide them. I shall issue an updated patients charter for Wales in July. The effectiveness of clinical care is being reviewed by the Chief Medical Officer and all units in the NHS will be kept in touch with this work through bulletins issued to doctors. In line with our commitment, the CMO will develop a plan to improve the effectiveness of clinical care and will monitor its implementation. We need doctors to ensure that medical work is truly making patients better.<br><br>
The Chief Medical Officer's group will also highlight evidence of inappropriate treatment. For example, I am told that D and Cs for women under the age of 40 years of age have shown to be of limited value. In my view, politicians should not intrude into medical judgments, unless they have medical skills of their own, which I do not have. I have no intention of so intruding. I am delighted, however, that the medical profession is developing this important work to ensure that all doctors are up to date in knowing what is the best treatment.<br><br>
Quality in the health service rests upon the individual actions of thousands of people. I want managers and medical team leaders to make quality the watch word in everything that they do.<br><br>
Members of the Committee may wish to know a little of how we are progressing with the west Glamorgan and south Glamorgan reviews. I understand that the west Glamorgan health authorities have agreed proposals, following public consultation, on reorganising the service for the people of Neath and Port Talbot. They prefer improved primary and community health services, together with a new hospital at Baglan to replace Neath general and Port Talbot hospitals. I am glad that progress is being made in reaching local agreement. I look forward to seeing the detailed proposals. From what I have heard so far, we may now have the basis for making real progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Secretary of State's comments on west Glamorgan. I wish to ask one question about the west of the county to which the health authority has responded. I refer to the pay settlement this year, which the Secretary of State announced, and interrelate that with the circumstances in west Glamorgan. If it is a fair assumption that provider units will pay the review body awards by doing extra work,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
what happens to the non-acute community providers whose work load is constant or dropping and who have no waiting lists? Will the Secretary of State answer that key question? What happens in the community in terms of the pay awards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government made their general policy clear. We believe that the pay awards can be catered for out of improved efficiency which, I am pleased to say, the health service is recording. I have announced that, overall, we are increasing cash by 5 per cent.—that is, £100 million—and that for the hospital and community health services area in Wales the increase is 4.3 per cent. For general practitioners, dentists and the like, it is 9 per cent. These large increases in cash in a period of low inflation more than take care of the needs of the service and will be allied to the efficiency improvements. The targets that I set for administrative costs add to the efficiency improvements because that money, too, is available for patient care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Secretary of State misses my point. In the western part of the health authority in west Glamorgan, there is no additional money for community nursing. How will he adjust the payment—not for general practitioners—in the health service for the community service? I accept the Secretary of State's overall premise. However, my personal reading of the facts is that, for that specific sector, the Welsh Office has made a fundamental mistake in linking productivity and pay. In so doing, it has completely missed the fact that it is not possible to cater for that when there are no waiting lists, such as in the community sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about that. We announced a general, fair policy across England and Wales when the pay review bodies announced their finding. Indeed, the policy was set out by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement. We believe that the health service is managing and can manage that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When does the Secretary of State expect to make a decision on Baglan hospital? If he makes a favourable decision, as I hope he will, when would he expect work to start? In view of deep resentment in my part of the world to his original midwifery proposals, will he seriously reconsider alternatives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the right hon. and learned Gentleman a firm date because I have not yet received the proposals from the health authority. However, if the process goes as smoothly as it appears to be going, I shall endeavour to turn the proposals round as quickly as possible and let the constituents of interested Members know the outcome through the usual channels as soon as lean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain <span class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To endorse the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris), may I press the Secretary of State on two points which I hope to raise later in greater detail if the opportunity arises? First, will he provide for extra emergency medical admissions? Secondly, it is essential that full obstetric maternity provision is available, not a downgraded midwifery solution beached on its own,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
which would be dangerous. Will he ensure that that provision is made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have agreed some words with my advisers ahead of the proposals being made and will now reply to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I accept that local communities in the Baglan area would like maximum clinical care provided at the Baglan site. For their part, they agree that for the more specialist or complex work, use should be made of other hospitals, including Morriston, where we have made a considerable investment in specialist faculties.<br><br>
The health authorities' plan builds on the framework that I proposed last summer, by allowing for medical emergencies to be admitted to the new hospital rather than being diverted. It also allows for the development of a local accident unit capable of treating many less serious cases, including fractures. The health authorities have also suggested that a decision about maternity services may be deferred until there is experience of its midwife-run unit now being established at Neath hospital. I expect those proposals from the health authorities. When I have them, I shall consider them and the observations made in this debate, and will make an announcement as soon as possible.<br><br>
In south Glamorgan, the health authorities have not yet submitted their proposals to me. Those that they have worked on have yet to attract the full agreement of many members of the public, the city council, the planning authority or hon. Members. I am interested in proposals that go with the grain of the local community. For their part, the council and others involved in planning must take account of the significant difficulties of delivering up-to-date health care and improving local faculties. Health professionals should also understand the ambitions and worries in the local community about Cardiff Royal Infirmary and the University Hospital of Wales.<br><br>
I urge everyone involved to make a major effort to reach early agreement on the way ahead, in the interests of better health care for the people of Cardiff. This is a classic test case of local councils' and institutions' ability to resolve important issues without the intervention of the Welsh Office. I have every confidence in that ability, but would welcome more rapid progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I commend the Secretary of State's choice of words as he looks to local people to find a settlement of difficult issues. Does he agree with me—I believe that I speak for all my colleagues—that one difficulty in finding agreement is that health authorities responsible for drawing up plans have no direct contact with, or basis in, the community that they serve? The first line of contact for me as a community representative to discuss the issues is the new planning director of the health authority, Dr. Peter Donnelly—an excellent doctor whom I have known for many years. He also happens to be a former Conservative candidate for Pontypridd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief, and interrogatory. The hon. Member must be more precise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the health authority were composed of people some of whom had a direct link with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
community instead of the link being appointees of the Secretary of State, many difficulties would be avoided. They would have greater confidence in putting their view and be held higher in public esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. My policy is to ask the health authority to work harder consulting all interested parties, to pay special attention to the views of elected councillors—especially those on the planning authority because they need to understand their concerns—and to consult widely in the usual way to test public opinion through meetings or by sending out questionnaires, or descriptions of plans. I assure the hon. Gentleman that my concern is to see many of these issues hammered out locally. I believe that that can be done by proper dialogue between the health authority and the council. I do not believe that it is necessary for councillors to be members of the health authority board to achieve that end.<br><br>
Pembrokeshire trust is currently making economies in its management and administration, as it should. It has delivered much high-quality patient care, treating more people than ever. Like the rest of Wales, by April 1994 it had hit patient charter standards for Pembrokeshire for the first time. This should not be disregarded by those wishing to make political capital from the need to restrain over-heavy expenditure.<br><br>
The health authority and trust are working closely on a plan to improve the trust's financial position in the short time, and will work on the maintenance and quality of its services. The plan is also to consider costs and efficiency and to examine the opportunities for developing new and better services. It is right that overhead costs should be questioned and brought into line with best performance elsewhere in the national health service. It is equally important that the trust be given opportunities to develop new cost-effective services to meet patients' needs in its area. Pembrokeshire's overheads became too high and are now being reduced. They need to be reduced rapidly so that the maximum sum sent to the trust can be spent on patient care. The trust also needs to plan more efficient provision of high-quality services.<br><br>
I am advised that the implementation of care in the community in Wales has gone fairly smoothly. Many people are cared for at home with support from both the health service and social services. There has been a decline in demand for nursing home places as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is approaching an important point about community care. When the original plans were announced in the Griffiths report, it was anticipated that at least 25 per cent. of people in residential homes would be more appropriately cared for in their own homes. Experience has shown that many more are cared for at home than was envisaged. This puts considerable pressure on community services, especially respite care, looking after carers and adaptations to local authority homes. Will the right hon. Gentleman look again at the budget to ensure that we discharge community care according to current demand, not the demand originally envisaged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the context of next year's settlement, I will look at that. I share some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns. Respite care is an important part of making a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
success of care in the community. We shall try to ensure that the settlement reflects that. It also requires a shift in expenditure between the more traditional types of care and the necessary new types of care. The Government must manage this. I have not received complaints at the Welsh Office from people who have been helped under the new arrangements that they regret being cared for in their own homes rather than in a care home, so that part of the policy seems successful.<br><br>
I have had a number of complaints from owners of private nursing homes who are worried about the decline in demand for their services. Where that has occurred because more people can be taken care of in their own home, it is an unfortunate consequence of a desirable policy. If it has occurred because a local council has acted unfairly in any way. I am happy to investigate. Each authority should want to, and should provide, the best quality care at the best price, whether it be in an individual's home, a local authority home, or a private sector home, as the person wishes and the professionals decide is appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that an important factor is that individuals—clients, members of families or carers—have the fullest possible information about alternatives so that they may judge what is in a client's best interest?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo those sentiments. I want people to be well informed because that is part of making a decent choice in the best interest of those concerned. I am worried that people who may need the support of hospital or residential health care may be asked to live in the community. I make a plea to all responsible for these sensitive and difficult judgments to ensure that all those who need the support that residential health care can give receive it.<br><br>
Echoing the point made by the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), I should also like local authorities to pay special attention to providing the respite care that some families need so that they can have a holiday, or a break from caring for severely disabled children. It is in everybody's interests that families should be kept together whenever possible, but some time should be made available for parents and other children in such families to have a break, when social services can help. It is a tragedy for a family to be split up because of a lack of a modest amount of respite care when the family is under too much strain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State or one of his officials visit the spastics home in Swansea which has remained empty for a couple of years simply because of budgetary constraint from the Welsh Office? It has the money for the capital costs but not for the running costs. It should allow harassed caring parents to have a very necessary rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would need to examine the details of that case. I have made clear my position on the general policy. In most cases it is for the local authority to decide how best to spend money. Today I have offered some thoughts—with which I think Opposition Members have some sympathy—on how the expenditure plans could develop.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
I am determined that the high standards of medical care in Wales should be maintained and made available to the ever-increasing number of patients seeking them. We are doing more, we are achieving more and we have a great deal of which to be proud. With the measures that I have outlined today to cut paperwork and bureaucracy further, to change the Common Services Authority and to direct more care into health care on the ground, we can achieve even more.<br><br>
More patients are being treated, people are living longer and the health service has never before achieved as much as it does now. For every person in Wales, £716 is spent—approximately £3,000 for a typical family. That is a huge amount which can do a great deal of good.</span></p>
<p>11.17am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I open today's proceedings for the Opposition by wishing the Secretary of State a happy birthday, but not too many happy returns as Secretary of State. I know that he will take that in the spirit in which it was intended.<br><br>
At our most recent sitting, we were told by the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) that Wales wanted to become more like Wokingham. I notice from the results of the European elections that Wokingham seemed to be becoming more like Wales. But for 0.4 per cent. of the vote, the Thames valley would have had a Labour MEP—a remarkable result. Perhaps our missionary work in the Thames valley has had more impact than the Secretary of State's missionary work for the Tories in Wales.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has sloganised a great deal about charters, guarantees and quality initiatives. I think that it is fair to say that, for most of us who are direct consumers of the health service in Wales and have surgeries with other such consumers, hearing people using words such as charters, guarantees and quality initiatives at a rate of more than six per minute provokes a desire to bring back capital punishment, or the threat of it. If my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael)—who is one of our home affairs spokesmen—were not present, I might say more on that, but I dare not.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that in April 1995 the Welsh Office will bring in what it refers to as a path-breaking initiative to give a total waiting time guarantee. When that was announced six months ago it was said to be the first guarantee of its kind in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State used a slightly different phrase this morning, calling it the best guarantee of its kind in the United Kingdom. He has no doubt found out, as I have, that the Scottish Office introduced such a guarantee for the six leading specialties almost two years ago and there are considerable problems with it. The Secretary of State would have shown the Committee more respect if he had referred to that Scottish Office guarantee introduced in 1993 and to how it was working, explaining how the Welsh Office intended to solve the problems that have emerged. The guarantee is an antidote to the hype that has surrounded the waiting-time guarantees for in-patient treatment, which we have discussed but not implemented since 1988, when Ian Grist—then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Welsh Office—said that he was introducing a total waiting-time guarantee just for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
the in-patient side of the treatment. However, we know that shorter in-patient waiting times have led to longer out-patient waiting times. Years later, the Welsh Office announces that we shall solve the problem by introducing—for the first time in the United Kingdom—a total waiting-time guarantee from April 1995. That will be perhaps two years after the Scottish Office has done the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Office has not done the same thing. I stand by both sets of words that I have used on the subject. For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman I shall be precise. In Scotland, the guarantee does not cover any gap that may occur between one's first out-patient appointment and when one is placed on an in-patient or day-case waiting list. Ours does. The guarantee does not uniformally cover the whole of Scotland, nor does it cover all specialties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Accepting that it does not cover specialties, I think that the problem of how to solve delayed placement by hospitals on the waiting list to see a consultant may outlive the Welsh Office's total waiting-time guarantee as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received a letter on that point from the new chief executive of South Glamorgan health authority, who comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"I recognise that a major problem exists in relation to orthopaedic out-patient and in-patient waiting times.".</p></blockquote>
In cases that I have dealt with in south Glamorgan, it is common for patients to wait for 18 months—even for two years—to secure an appointment with a consultant to become an in-patient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. Two years is a generous assessment in some specialties. In orthopaedic spinal conditions it can take five years to see a consultant. How does someone in need of an orthopaedic operation wait for five yeare—close to the beginning of the next millenium—before being given an appointment with a consultant? We want the Secretary of State to tell us how one gets from where one is to where one wants to be. He should tell us frankly about the problems that have emerged with the guarantee in its more limited form in Scotland, there could be lessons for us all. We know that it does not guarantee the consultant of the GP's choice. Does that mean that, when the guarantee is introduced in Wales, one may go on a consultant's waiting list but it may not be the consultant that the GP thinks should carry out the treatment? We could not accept a situation where one could go on a waiting list but would not know whether the consultant was in Wales or whether the appointment would involve lengthy travel. We would like to hear more detail from the Secretary of State, instead of press-release hyperbole, which has been characteristic of the Government's approach to the NHS since Ian Grist started to talk about patients charter, maximum waiting lists, or waiting-time guarantees about six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is saying, presumably, that it is unfair that patients may wait for a long time on the assumption that they will have their surgery with a specific consultant. In reality, they may be on the list for a long time, while another consultant surgeon in the same
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
specialty and the same hospital, with a far shorter waiting list, is available to perform that surgery. Does he think that there should be a common waiting list, instead of the ridiculous situation where the senior registrar eventually carries out the surgery and not the person whom the individual thinks will be carrying it out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful that that point has been made, because the Secretary of State has been singularly silent on the issue. Will the guarantee be screwed up by people being told that they have to go a long distance to obtain treatment within the waiting-time guarantee? Will the guarantee still be effective if the patient's GP specifies that the consultant must carry out the surgery, not the senior registrar? There are so many holes in the guarantee that it may turn out like the Ian Grist guarantee about waiting times for in-patient treatment that was announced six years ago. It has now been announced that that target has been achieved, but the promise was that it would be achieved two years after it was announced in 1988.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to the increase in the number of in-patients, day case and out-patient treatments, using the statistics now available for the year 1993–94, compared to those for the year 1992–93. The right hon. Gentleman referred to a 7 per cent. increase in in-patient and day case treatments and to a 4.5 per cent. increase in out-patient treatments.<br><br>
The Secretary of State did not comment—although he should have done—on the BBC "Week in, Week out" programme's reference to the analysis carried out by the Clwyd health authority investigative team of the Pembrokeshire health trust's claimed patient treatment figures. I know that the Secretary of State tends to hold strong views about BBC journalists' interpretations—particularly those working on "Week in, Week out"—and I believe that the views of the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) are even stronger, but neither they nor the Opposition said that trusts were inflating the figures. It was people from within the health authority and health trust world. A two-person team, one from the provider side and one from the purchaser side of the national health service in Wales, carried out a careful analysis of the Pembrokeshire NHS trust claimed patient treatment figures and concluded that the trust was inflating the figures.<br><br>
If that is true of the Pembrokeshire NHS trust, it may only be that body that has inflated the figures, but there must be a suspicion that other areas may do so, too. The Secretary of State did not mention the matter this morning, because it would spoil the glossy brochure approach to selling the virtues of the Tory version of the NHS. We hope to learn, perhaps from the winding-up speech today, whether the Welsh Office has independently studied whether the incentives to inflate the figures for patients treated are now so strong under the purchaser-provider split, that every time an in-patient who may be in for a chest problem goes to the toilet, he is ticked in the box as having had a bladder relief treatment as well.<br><br>
I exaggerate slightly, of course, but that is now a problem. The ticks in the box are being put there when no separate treatment has actually occurred, simply so that more charges can be made and, where performance-related pay is given, people may be able to get into the bracket that gives them an extra £5,000 in their salary cheques at the end of the year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
With the Pembrokeshire example in front of us, we want to know what the Welsh Office is doing to check the practice, which certainly exists in one major health trust in Wales and which may also exist elsewhere, given the incentives to inflate figures. We do not know whether the 7 per cent. and the 4 per cent. are genuine figures. We believe that they are not genuine in one part of Wales, not because of what we have said, but because of what people working for the NHS in Wales have said.<br><br>
We now come to the question of the additional money that the Secretary of State says that he has provided. When the Welsh Grand Committee discussed the impact of the Budget on Wales, reference was made to the fact that the Secretary of State, in the conventional phraseology, had won an additional 5 per cent. in cash terms over last year's Budget settlement for the Welsh Office. An additional £320 million was to be added to the £6.1 billion—an increase of 5 per cent., based on certain assumptions.<br><br>
What does the 5 per cent. mean? At that time—December, last year—the Secretary of State had not announced how the money would be spent, but he said that health and education would undoubtedly be at the top of his list. If there were to be a 5 per cent. cash increase overall from 1 April this year, more than 5 per cent. would be spent on health and more than 5 per cent. on education. It took the Secretary of State a long time to tell the health authorities what their additional money would be. He made great play in his actions this morning by saying that he has given health authorities more than 5 per cent. this year. But he did not tell the Committee on what date he told the health authorities how much money they would receive this year. When I questioned him about that on 15 March, he still had not announced the amount. That was just two weeks before the start of the financial year. The health authorities in Wales did not know how much additional money they were going to receive.<br><br>
That gave rise to a furious exchange. The chairman of the chairmen's panel of trusts in Wales, Derek Morgan—a well known Conservative supporter and treasurer of the Bridgend Conservative Association—is, I believe, typical of the Tory placemen who have been slotted into the trusts. But acting as chairman of the Tory placemen in charge of nearly all the trusts, he said that as an ex-management consultant, having spent his life in business, he believed that the Secretary of State does not know how to run a whelk store. He told the Secretary of State that he was giving the trusts the settlement too late in the day. The Secretary of State should have told us when he announced the external financial limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was 16 March compared with 4 March the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I like to ask helpful questions because the Secretary of State often answers them and acts on them the next day. One of the useful functions of the Opposition is to remind him that the very lateness of supplying that information caused the NHS enormous planning difficulties, as betokened by Derek Morgan's letter to him on behalf of the trusts pointing out that they cannot work like that. They want to be told in advance so that they can plan for the following year. How can they be expected to make plans on capital expenditure or for the run-through of each quarter of the year?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
The same problem will occur this year. For example, Llandough hospital, one of the largest general hospitals in Wales, ran out of money in January or February this year—the contract had been exhausted. A big political row ensued. Opposition spokesmen, again trying to help the Government by drawing the matter to their attention, pointed out that it was a great disgrace that surgeons were sitting idle while patients sat at home. Health authorities had to wait for the Welsh Office to release a last-minute initiative to cut patients' waiting time, which gave Ministers the credit for doing something. Ministers release money at the end of the financial year when half the people in the NHS—doctors and nurses—have booked holidays. Doctors and nurses are expected to work overtime on Saturdays and Sundays to perform operations before 1 April, when the money is exhausted.<br><br>
That is no way to run the NHS. We should give it notice of money in plenty of time to plan the flow of work through the quarters of the year so that it knows where it stands at the beginning of the year. The Government cannot continue to keep money back and then release it at the last minute while expecting people to arrange overtime, cancel holidays and work at weekends. Rhydlafar hospital in my constituency was expected to perform 16 hip operations a day in March. That was dangerous and breached most of the professional guidelines for the anaesthetists and the orthopaedic surgeons. That policy had to be scrapped and the South Glamorgan health authority had to repay money to Mid Glamorgan health authority for failing to fulfil its contract.<br><br>
That happened because the authority was unable to plan a smooth, steady flow of work through the financial year without any daft, last-minute initiatives in February or March when Ministers release topslice money so that they look like whizkids who know how to put the whip on people in the health service who they believe cannot work in a sensible adult way. Money should be given to health authorities in time for them to plan before the financial year begins and without the withhold money which is released at the end of the financial year when everyone thinks that the Minister would prefer them to go on a skiing holiday.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to mergers of health authorities. He mentioned the great initiative that he would undertake and said that he was especially keen on merging two health authorities in south-west Wales—East Dyfed and Pembrokeshire—and possibly other mergers. He did not tell the Committee that it was his predecessor but three—Nicholas Edwards, who is now Lord Crickhowell—who decided to break up the old Dyfed health authority. He should have said that Lord Crickhowell was wrong to do that—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, the Secretary of State does not know that. It happened not long after the 1979 election when Lord Crickhowell was the Tory Member for Pembroke and wanted Pembrokeshire to have its own separate health authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how many inaccurate statements the hon. Gentleman intends to make. Of course I knew. I also knew the circumstances, and the then Secretary of State made a sensible judgment. If the hon.

changed. I would have thought that he would welcome proposals to concentrate more money on patient care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must have misheard the Secretary of State and I regret misleading the Committee. Why did he not tell the Committee honestly and frankly that he was reversing a change that had been introduced by a previous Secretary of State for Wales, who was the Member of Parliament for Pembroke before happily moving on to a quango and a seat in the upper House?<br><br>
I turn to the question whether a reduction from nine to eight and then to three in the number of health authorities is acceptable. The general feeling of Opposition Members is that until we know the impact of merging the FHSAs and what remains of the health authorities—the purchasing rump—it would be rash to move on to further rationalisation. We need to know how the current merger beds down and whether it will be successful. When will legislation be introduced to reduce the present nonsense in Gwent and south Glamorgan? In south Glamorgan, a chief executive works for two chairmen—Jan Sainsbury and Derek Morgan. Both are Tory placemen and well-known Tory figures, but it causes difficulties for the chief executive to have two chairmen. That must be sorted out by legislation and judged in terms of delivering health care. Why plan yet another merger before we know whether the first one has worked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way again.<br><br>
Will the Opposition ever accept a proposal that I make to abolish a quango? The Opposition make a lot of noise about how undesirable quangos are, but whenever we suggest reducing them, the Opposition spring up and say that we must keep them all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that the Secretary of State has not abolished a quango. There are two quangos in south Glamorgan. The South Glamorgan FHSA still has a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State or his predecessor, and the South Glamorgan health authority still has a quango chairman appointed by him. Operationally, they are gradually merging their services, but we know nothing about abolishing a quango. The right hon. Gentleman told us this morning that he proposes to do so, but when will the primary legislation be introduced? That will be the time for the Government to say that they hope, subject to certain results, to merge the new animals—a combination of FHSAs and health authorities—on a geographical as well as a functional basis. Instead of having 18 FHSAs and health authority quangos in Wales, there would be only three, but how long would that take and how would it be judged whether that was successful? We do not want slogans about reducing quangos by one. We want to know whether better services would be delivered with less paperwork by reducing the number of quangos. That has not happened yet and there is no point claiming that it has.<br><br>
The Secretary of State then referred to the ideological battle for supremacy between himself and the Secretary of State for Health. He seems to be unduly sensitive on that issue. He took pains to read out some 10 lines of a speech made by the Secretary of State for Health to discredit all the stories that suggest that he does not agree
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
with the right hon. Lady about whether the health service is undermanaged or overmanaged. I do not know why he sought to pray in aid her words. She is not especially relevant to the Committee's proceedings and the Secretary of State for Wales should make up his own mind.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman has obviously been cut to the quick by the fear that he is not winning the battle for the hearts and minds of Tory party supporters. If he speaks to a fringe meeting at the next Conservative party conference, he will want to say that he is the scourge of bureaucracy in the national health service. He will not want it broadcast that he is trying to score one over the Secretary of State for Health. He asserts that there is a united front between himself and the right hon. Lady, but is he trying to score one over the Secretary of State for Health? Was he given a ticking off? Did he have to meet the right hon. Lady at 8 o'clock in the morning at Marks and Spencer in Oxford street and wheel her shopping trolley around for at least one day as a form of punishment? Was he punished as he tried to punish the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) for being naughty and talking about the excess bureaucrats in the NHS and spoiling the line of the Minister of State for Health, the Secretary of State for Health and, indeed, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Welsh Office, who had all been saying that an increase in management was urgently needed because the NHS had previously been undermanaged? Now they are saying that the press got it wrong and that there is a united front on health bureaucracy, which they all want to reduce because they realise that the public do not like the new purchaser-provider split and the increase in the number of accountants that that has necessarily brought about.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has not told us how he will get away with having an accountancy-led system, split into a purchaser-provider function, without increasing the number of accountants who will operate the system. He skated over that problem this morning A purchaser-provider split inevitably demands more accountants and more clerks to support the accountants, shuffle pieces of paper, indicate charges and determine whether payment has been made—perhaps in a surrogate manner—so that the accounts add up at the end of the year. It is impossible to have a purchaser-provider split without people to operate the purchasing and providing. That requires an army of sales managers and accountants and clerical support for both functions.<br><br>
If the Government do not want a purchaser-provider split, that is fine. The Secretary of State could tell the Committee this morning that the NHS reforms of 1990 were all wrong and that we should return to the old system because it operated with far fewer accountants, but he will not do that. To prove what a good boy he is as a destroyer of bureaucrats, he referred to the Welsh Health Common Services Authority. He then carefully exempted the clinical side of that authority—breast test Wales, the artificial limb and appliance centre and the national blood transfusion service. Obviously, the Welsh Health Common Services Authority does not provide front-line services to patients, but the Secretary of State admitted that it provided many clinical services. He did not give the proportion, although that would have helped to free many people from the anxiety that his announcement will inevitably cause. Is it approximately 50 per cent., more or less? Then we come to the people whom he would see

as the devils—the people on the WHCSA in suede shoes and grey suits, not in white coats, who will be subject to the draconian announcements that he made this morning about major advances in market testing. One interpretation of his announcement could be that we shall shortly see the winding up of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority as a common health authority.<br><br>
What the Secretary of State should have told the Committee is that he had analysed the figures for the costs of the non-clinical services—architecture, engineering, supplies, purchasing and so on—of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority as supplied to Welsh health authorities. He looked across at the English regional health authorities with similar budgets and saw that their supplies are cheaper because no part of England has a Welsh Health Common Services Authority. The authorities already operate on a market-tested, free-market basis to buy their supplies, do their purchasing and engineering and put their hospital building out to private architects. Let us study the costs. Is the Secretary of State saying that, in England, the regional health authorities which have already abolished then-equivalent of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority find that it is cheaper to go private, and to buy in all their architectural, engineering and supplies services without the intermediary of a central health authority? Or, is he telling us that the Welsh Health Common Services Authority provides architecture, engineering and supplies services more cheaply than the private sector?<br><br>
The Secretary of State has uttered the slogan "We are going to market test. We shall wind up the non-clinical side and it will be moved into the mainstream NHS." I am not quite sure what that means—I think that it means a wind up of the non-clinical side but on what comparative costing figures is that measure based? Are those services cheaper in England, where there is no Welsh Health Common Services Authority, or are they more expensive? Unless the Secretary of State can tell us that those services are cheaper in England, where they have abolished then-equivalent of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority, he will be increasing the costs that will be borne by the health authority. I see him shaking his head, but he has not given me the figures which presumably, if they were available, would back up the claim that it is good value for money to abolish the non-clinical side of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the obvious areas where I am proposing to market test 1,162 people are involved, so more than 50 per cent. of the total staff in the Common Services Authority are involved. The point about market testing is that if no one else can do something more cheaply, one carries on doing it in the same old way. If they can do it more cheaply, there is benefit to the taxpayer. Of course some studies have been done of the relative costs of procurement in England and Wales. The differences in arrangements are not the only factors that influence the costs. There is also a large difference in the relative size of the two areas and their procurement muscle. I have asked that that factor also be explored to find out whether there are any ways in which we can make greater use of common purchasing muscle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Right, so we have been given one fact about the number of people concerned, and an assertion that market testing is something new to the Welsh Health
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
Common Services Authority. The Secretary of State still has not told us whether market testing involves abrogating the agency agreement which the Welsh Health Common Services Authority has with all the health authorities, or is that a time-expiring contract anyway? Most of the work of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority is, I believe, already market tested. It sells its services in the middle east. How will that ability to bring export earnings to Wales for designing a hospital in Abu Dhabi be preserved if there is no basis of work in Wales? The Secretary of State has simply ignored that problem.<br><br>
The Secretary of State went on to say that the Government had great plans to stop the health authorities in Wales recruiting any clerical staff except on the say-so of the Secretary of State. That is meddling on a scale that is causing so much anger among the people who are involved in running the NHS in Wales that I think that the Secretary of State is aware of it, but he thinks that the political gain is worth the hassle of having more bureaucrats in the Welsh Office checking that there are fewer bureaucrats in the health authority. That is the sign of a meddling Secretary of State, whose sole aim is to get on his feet in a fringe meeting at a Tory party conference and say what he has done to cut bureaucracy in the health service in Wales. He needs more clerks and he needs to spend more of his time to achieve his aim of reducing bureaucracy in the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to a question that I put to the Secretary of State he said that he had previously said in his statement that he was cutting back in the Welsh Office. If my hon. Friend's argument is true, how can the Secretary of State be doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard the slogans, but we have not seen the performance. The Secretary of State said that he would introduce an initiative to cut paperwork. How many people will believe his utterings in a Welsh Grand Committee when they know that he is operating a paperwork and accountancy-driven system and not one driven by patient care? That is the danger that he will find.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred briefly to community care. It is an important area on which the Welsh Office should issue guidelines in response to the points that my hon. Friends made. The community care initiative has operated for a short period in which each local health authority and each social services department has tried to reach a modus vivendi on who pays for what. The Secretary of State implied that things were settling down well, but they cannot be when many people see the introduction of community care as involving the introduction of means testing for services that were previously provided free by the national health service.<br><br>
Let us take the case of a person in a hospice such as the Holme Towers hospice in Penarth who has a few months to live. That person may decide to spend his or her last few months at home. Immediately he or she does that, they are means tested for the additional care required. If we or a member of our family were in that position, we would probably want to spend our remaining months at home. However, as soon as we make that choice, we are exposed to the risk of means testing. Any system that exposes hospice-care patients who decide to spend their last few weeks or months at home to the risk of means

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
testing for the nursing services that they require cannot be regarded as settling down smoothly.<br><br>
There is a huge problem in deciding what services should be means tested. If a service is purchased by a health authority, it is not means tested. However, if it is purchased by the social services department, it is very likely that it will be means tested. The Secretary of State should have considered that problem this morning. People are suspicious that the gradual extension of community care will mean the gradual extension of means testing into areas that were previously regarded as part of the national health service. The Secretary of State skipped over that major problem because he wants to keep us in the world of public relations, press releases and hype that is associated with his and previous Tory Secretaries of State's performances when they discuss events in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point to another problem that the Government should tackle? A Welsh Office circular deals with the discharge of patients from hospitals. It makes it clear that if a person does not wish to be means tested when he is discharged from a private nursing home, he need not be means tested and the charge falls on the state. In practice, the acute sector is put under enormous pressure. Social workers in hospitals inform parents and patients that they should look for a private nursing home and the forms are signed before one can say Jack Robinson. Therefore, patients feel that they have suffered a major injustice.<br><br>
The Government should end that practice by withdrawing the circular and by making it clear that anyone who is discharged from a hospital to a private nursing home will be means tested. That would end the almost corrupt practice that puts enormous pressure on social workers in hospitals to do things that they plainly do not want to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spend too much longer on this point, but it is important. Brochures for nursing homes are dumped on the patients or the relatives' chair when a hospital feels that it has done as much as it can in the acute phase. The clear implication is that that would soon be followed by the dumping of a granny on the doorstep of the nearest relatives, the approach being, in effect, "You are blocking a bed. We want you out" That is a serious problem.<br><br>
Those observations are perhaps my final condemnation this morning of a Secretary of State who meddles ineffectually. He announces initiatives to reduce paperwork, but does not say how performance is to be achieved. Even the Tory placemen who have put been in charge of the trusts are as furious with him as we and the patients in Wales are. He must face that problem, which was highlighted by last week's elections. Indeed, if the parties in Wales were auto-rental companies, we would be Hertz, Plaid Cymru would be somewhere between Avis and Swan and the Tory party would be Barry van hire or its equivalent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind right hon. and hon. Members that this important debate is a morning session only. Given the time factor, I was beginning to think that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
would be purely a confrontation between the two Front Benches. However, several hon. Members have indicated that they wish to speak. If I am to stand any chance of calling them, speeches must be especially brief.</span></p>
<p>11.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I want to raise with the Government the issue of the future of Neath and Port Talbot hospitals. I was marginally encouraged by the Secretary of State's response to the questions from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and me this morning. This has been a sorry saga. The future of the Neath and Port Talbot hospitals has been a slippery process of the Government sliding away from their original commitment, made during the Neath by-election, to build a 500-bed hospital on Baglan moors to replace those hospitals. That original commitment, after a process of review announced in November 1992, finally found its way forward in the form of an option from the local health authorities—virtually unanimously backed in the local community—for a 380-bed hospital. Flying in the face of all local opinion and expert advice, the Secretary of State decided to overturn that and propose a 200-bed hospital. That persistent downgrading has left Neath and Port Talbot extremely worried about the future.<br><br>
Local people are especially worried about the abandonment in the Secretary of State's option—which has now been consulted upon and proposals are coming from the local health authorities to progress matters—of comprehensive accident and emergency facilities, providing only elective surgery and minimal accident faculties in their place. To the great fear of local people, he also downgraded the much-valued maternity unit provision in Neath hospital, providing only a midwife unit. Again, that rode roughshod over local opinion. He seemed to rely on a spurious assumption that there were surplus beds in west Glamorgan. In fact, the Secretary of State's option provides for a frightening reduction of 235 acute beds, against a background of acute beds being well used in the area every day. Indeed, Neath hospital was closed for admissions on 90 occasions in 1993 because no medical beds were available. From 1 January to 31 March this year, it has been closed for admissions on 30 occasions. There is absolutely no evidence that there are surplus beds.<br><br>
Those closures and the pressure on beds in Neath and Port Talbot are against a background where Bridgend, Morriston, Singleton and Llanelli hospitals—the neighbouring hospitals—cannot provide the patient care to replace that which is unavailable locally. Patients often have to be transferred outside west Glamorgan.<br><br>
The assumptions on which the Secretary of State based his option—on which the consultation process has been proceeding and proposals are coming back to him—are spurious indeed. They also rely on an unrealistically large transfer of obstetrics from fully-fledged maternity to midwifery services. The proposal is simply to provide a free-standing midwifery unit in the new hospital in Neath, for which no precedent has been established and my right hon. and learned friend the Member for Aberavon made that point. There is no precedent for a midwifery unit without the fully-fledged maternity services that Neath has been used to and which every comparable hospital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
has. I suggest that the Secretary of State would not allow his children to be born in a hospital that had only a midwifery unit. We know that in up to a fifth of cases, women who enter maternity units with the prospect of being dealt with routinely require transfer to emergency faculties for caesarean birth or something similar. That happened to my sister last year. There is a real prospect of babies dying and of mothers' health being seriously endangered if there is only a midwife unit.<br><br>
It is also essential to rebuff the argument that medical facilities, including acute medical facilities, can be centralised at Morriston hospital for the West Glamorgan area. Although there is a case for some centralisation for specialist facilities, especially major trauma, there is a need, especially for general medicine, for emergency facilities in Neath. Why should there be discrimination against Neath and Port Talbot when neighbouring areas of similar sizes—and communities of similar size across Wales, such as Carmarthen, Bridgend, Merthyr, Aberystwyth and Haverfordwest—have such emergency acute facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree on the fundamental importance of ambulance crews including paramedics who are called to major accidents taking the patient to the appropriate emergency unit. It could be catastrophic if a patient with, for example, a severe head injury, were taken to an inappropriate centre. The delay could cost the person's life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that and I do not consider that there is an argument about it, but I remind my hon. Friend and the Secretary of State that in parts of the valley areas of Neath and Port Talbot people must travel up to 20 miles for emergency treatment, often through traffic-clogged roads. There is a danger that unless the Secretary of State provides the additional faculties for which local health authorities are pressing, lives could be lost or injuries could prove more damaging because of the resulting gaps in provision. Patients in the east area of West Glamorgan will face a crisis if the option that the Secretary of State has placed before local people for consultation is railroaded through.<br><br>
In West Glamorgan the highest levels of deprivation and poverty and the deepest health need are found in the east area. All the indices show that. That area has more households with at least one disabled person, for example, and higher mortality and stillbirth ratios. We need a local general hospital such as has traditionally been relied on and valued in Neath and Port Talbot.<br><br>
I should have preferred the option that had almost unanimous support—including that of both the West Glamorgan health authorities—of a 380-bed general hospital on Baglan moors. That option has my firm and positive support. However, perhaps it is possible to bridge the gap between the Secretary of State's 200-bed option and the proposals that are now before him, which will meet two important local requirements—first, in catering for emergency medical admissions and providing accident and emergency faculties, and, secondly, as he seemed to suggest, in not simply dispensing unilaterally with the maternity provision on which Neath people have relied. Perhaps on an experimental basis, a midwifery unit could work alongside such existing faculties. A future
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
proposal could emerge from such an experiment. Indeed, that is essential. Although a new hospital has been built, existing provision has been savaged. Under the guise of updating and modernising health service provision in west Glamorgan, local people will experience a severe cut in services, which could endanger lives and patient care.</span></p>
<p>12.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the people of Wales have considerable anxieties about the health service. Those anxieties remain high on the political agenda and were reflected in the considerable slump in support for the Government in the European elections and many other elections since 1992. Despite our strong support for the health service, the people of Wales and of Plaid Cymru are generally prepared to accept that the service cannot stand still. Changes are needed. But we are anxious that the Government seem more concerned with the structure of the service—with setting up trusts and GP fundholding practices—than asking fundamental questions about the sort of health care that should be delivered into the 21st century. If we return to first principles—that health care should be free at the point of delivery and based on need rather than the ability to pay—the Government should have the decency to admit that they cannot, or will not, deliver on those terms.<br><br>
The brutal truth is that health care in Wales is being rationed because the Government are not prepared to fund the service to the point where it meets all the demands placed upon it. Of course, that rationing is not explicit. I remember that, when the then Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Bristol, West (Mr.Waldegrave), suggested a debate on that issue, he was quickly gagged. The fact that the Government have changed the structures within which the health service is delivered, producing trusts and GP fundholders, has not changed the basic problem—underfunding. So there continue to be waiting lists. That is the implicit rationing system. Juggling the budgets does not disguise that problem. All the statistics show that there has been a substantial increase in waiting lists during the past 10 years. There has been a 70 per cent. increase in the waiting list for out-patient consultations and a 15 per cent. increase in that for in-patient admission.<br><br>
The Government claim that they have a strategy for reducing waiting lists. But they have not allocated substantial resources to tackle that problem. Thus, if pressure is applied on hospitals to reduce waiting lists for elective surgery or non-urgent treatment, money is simply moved from one budget head to another. That led to the crisis in accident and emergency units in which patients were kept on trolleys in corridors because there were no beds for them. The beds were taken up by those taken off waiting lists for elective surgery. So the reduction of pressure at one point applied pressure at another.<br><br>
As other hon. Members have mentioned, there is the annual ritual of ward closures because cash runs out before the year end, or no cash is available for referrals out of district. The Government should at least admit that they are not prepared to fund all the health care demands of the population and begin a debate about the kind of service that they are prepared to fund, so that the issues can be openly discussed and the electorate better informed about the available choices and options.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
The Government and the public might not be prepared to have a local and full discussion about the explicit rationing of health care and whether some forms of treatment might not be provided by a state service. Therefore, we are faced with the fairly restrictive option of seeking ways to increase the budget and standardise some medical procedures and interventions by properly analysing the outcome of such procedures and interventions.<br><br>
The difficulty—which neither the Opposition nor the Government have yet been prepared to examine properly—is that some clinical judgments and freedoms could be affected. We cannot have it both ways. We either claim that the health service can be funded to meet all demands or we tell the public that we shall not be able to fund all services, leading to an open and clear debate about what we are prepared to do. The proper way is to examine some of the old shibboleths and to tell doctors and surgeons that we can standardise certain procedures. We should not pretend that reducing waiting lists solves the problem because it simply moves it elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what effects he believes the development of Cefni hospital, West Mold community hospital and phase two of the development of ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor will have on his constituents, bearing in mind what he has just said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the developments at West Mold and Cefni. The problem is that they will not and cannot meet the entire demand of the population. They are excellent services as far as they go.<br><br>
I shall give an example. An ambulance unit should be being built at West Mold hospital, but that is not being provided. The present facilities in Holyhead are deplorable, as everybody knows, but there will not be sufficient funds for the West Mold unit. I know that the Secretary of State is aware of the representations that have been made—including my own—and I hope that he will take them on board.<br><br>
The Government have introduced changes on the basis that they would improve patient care and more patients would be treated. Despite the Secretary of State's protestations, the setting up of trusts and of GP fundholding has increased administration and the level of management manpower in the health service. The figures show that between 1992 and 1993 there was a reduction of 6.5 per cent. in the number of nurses and midwifery staff in Wales, together with a 14 per cent. increase in the numbers of administrative and clerical staff. That cannot be justified. The promised increases in patient choice through making more money available for direct patient services cannot be delivered by having fewer nurses and midwives and more managers and clerical staff. I accept that, within those figures, some nurses have been regraded and taken into administration. I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State say that some of those may move back to the clinical side, which is a welcome development.<br><br>
I should like to touch briefly on the issue of local pay deals, which is a tremendous blow to the morale of health service workers. Despite the Government's protestations that trusts will be able to examine their pay structures, it will inevitably mean that those working in trusts will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
have fewer salary increases and worse working conditions because their bargaining power will be substantially weakened. I should also like to know whether the Government will fund in full the increase announced by the pay review body.<br><br>
Bearing in mind your comments about the time scale, Mr. Hughes, I should like to make one further point about the blurring of the distinction between health care and social care, which I know that many people in the health service are worried about. One can be extremely uncharitable to the Government and say that they want that distinction to be blurred because, as we have heard, health care is free at the point of delivery but social care is means tested, so in terms of budgets, it is an advantage for more people to be dealt with through social care than through health care.<br><br>
Local authorities are facing tremendous pressure from the Government to increase their expenditure on home care services, meals on wheels and all the other services that they provide, but that would be a retrograde step. Local authorities have to deliver community care in its widest sense because more and more people—more than were ever envisaged—will be cared for in their own homes. We must increase the community care budget, but we must not penalise local authorities. They must not be made scapegoats. If health care is the appropriate care for people, that care should be delivered, free, without putting pressure on families and carers to move into social care.<br><br>
The Government must say whether they are prepared to fund community care fully and give us a proper explanation of the distinction between health care and social care. The Government must be up front about this. Let us have a proper debate. Only then can the people of Wales have a proper debate on the way in which we want the health service to develop into the next century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was predictable in a debate of this nature that we would hear some party political comment from the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan). It is a sad feature of any debate about the NHS that comments of that sort have to be made by Opposition Members.<br><br>
I want to make a few brief observations—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery will be very interested in one aspect of what I am about to say. We have often heard speeches about how the health service is supposedly in the hands of Tory placemen. May I remind Opposition Members that it was their distinct hostility towards the health service reforms in Wales that encouraged their supporters to have nothing to do with those reforms?<br><br>
Opposition Members like to present the image nowadays that the Secretary of State has been selective about whom he has appointed having the talents of all those participating in public life in Wales available to choose from. That has not been the case. Where supporters of the Labour party have been prepared to accept appointments—such as the former chairman of the Mid Glamorgan health authority—they have been subjected to great hostility from Opposition Members for having done so. The former chairman of the Mid Glamorgan health authority retired from his post, and I am bound to say that some Opposition Members contributed to his resignation. We well remember that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
served a trade union in Wales for many years. Let us not hear so much from Opposition Members about how all the health bodies are comprised of Tory placemen.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery should recognise this point. He will welcome, as I do, the recent appointment of Lady Davies to the health care trust in Powys, which is our area. She has a long record of service on the health authority in Powys, but followed the political line of concern about the way in which health services were being reorganised in Wales and initially declined to serve. Those health service reforms having been implemented, she has said that she would now wish to make a contribution. I welcome the Secretary of State's decision to appoint Lady Davies to the Powys health care trust, where her experience will be beneficial and worthwhile.<br><br>
I think those examples answer the complaints about a situation in which there appear to be more Conservative supporters on many of those health bodies. We must see the nominations and welcome people coming from other parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the appointment of Lady Davies. She has made a significant impact on thinking in the health service in mid-Wales in the past. She is entirely objective and takes no party line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, no one—including the hon. and learned Gentleman—would claim that she was a Tory-placed person. That example underlines my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is so animated, I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way as it allows me to finish the point I was making to the Secretary of State earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is not here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I shall make it to the hon. Gentleman. In south Glamorgan we have discussed the difficulties of rearranging health care in terms of acute hospitals. I have made representations to the director of planning and, above him, to the chairman of the South Glamorgan health authority and, above him, to the Minister with responsibility for health in the Welsh Office. Each of those people was a candidate for the Conservative party in the previous general election. That is an odd coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can put the hon. Gentleman right. Those people were not representatives of Mr. Hughes's party. That is the implication of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. In view of his animated contribution, I look forward to reading the list of nominees that he put forward to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for appointments to public service in Wales on the health authorities during the previous year. If he did not do that, perhaps he will at least apply his mind to suggesting a few names for the future. My right hon. Friend cannot be criticised for appointing people to public bodies in Wales if there are no nominations from the Opposition.<br><br>
Mindful of your wish for brevity, Mr. Hughes, I want to make only two points in relation to my own constituency.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
First, general concern has been expressed in Wales about the financial settlement this year. I accept that, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it is important that savings be made and that we should aim for greater efficiency. I am sure, however, that my right hon. Friend is aware that, because of the change in capitation arrangements, the amount of money being given to Powys has been on a declining curve over several years. That presents particular problems for a rural area. While we must all aim for maximum efficiency, I want assurances that those specific problems, which arise from the combination of this year's settlement with the capitation change, are recognised.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the provision of NHS dental services throughout Powys. I have been in contact with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about the matter, and I am grateful to him for approving the appointment of a salaried dentist in Builth Wells when the practitioner there withdrew from NHS cover last year. However, my hon. Friend will know that a specific problem has arisen in Presteigne. I have been in contact with him about the matter, which has a wider implication for rural areas in general. In Presteigne, it might be appropriate to make an application to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to approve the appointment of a salaried dentist. At present, there is no dental practice there at all, the local dentist having moved away.<br><br>
Given the time that has passed since that dentist left and the consideration of the application by the Welsh Office, most of the people in the town have been told that they need to register with another dentist and have selected one in Knighton, eight to 10 miles away. As those people have re-registered, the workload of a dentist in Presteigne will probably be insufficient for a salaried dentist to be approved. I understand that argument. However, the upshot will be that no dental facilities will be provided in that town and, as in many other rural areas, NHS cover will only be available to those people who can take long journeys to receive it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary need to keep that specific point in mind when considering the difficulties of rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wardell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because I have taken up some time and others wish to contribute to the debate.</span></p>
<p>12.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to start by joining in the good wishes expressed for the Secretary of State's birthday. I make one proviso: that I am granted the wish when he blows out the candles on his cake.<br><br>
I am sure that Welsh Office officials will have prepared today's horoscopes for the Secretary of State. But I shall remind him of Justin Toper's horoscope in <i>The Sun,</i> bearing in mind that a Cabinet reshuffle is likely to occur soon. Part of the Secretary of State's horoscope reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"what happens very soon could well take some of the wind out of your sails."</p></blockquote>
Bearing in mind today's later debates, my horoscope includes:
<br><blockquote><p>"It also signifies the kind of responses you could only dream about."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
However, let us move from birthdays to the health service. I wish to make two or three brief points. I intended to make my first point earlier, but an uncharacteristic outburst of childish petulance by the Secretary of State prevented me from intervening. I wished to refer to general practitioners. I have two interests to declare: the first as the honorary adviser to the Overseas Doctors Association in the UK Ltd, which has approximately 12,000 members, many of whom work in Wales, and the second as a lay member of the General Medical Council.<br><br>
There are many single-handed general practitioners in Wales. It was once rumoured that the Department of Health had an agenda to try to ensure that single-handed general practitioners slowly withered on the vine. Some general practitioners work single-handedly from choice, because they believe that they can provide a better service by working in that way. Others work single-handedly because forming partnerships with others is not feasible in the areas in which they work. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State could confirm that the Welsh Office has no agenda for driving single-handed practitioners out of the health service. I concede that the evidence to show that group practices work is telling. But diversity and choice in the health service are worth retaining.<br><br>
My second point deals with a subject that was raised by the Royal College of Nursing. Members of the royal college in Wales are worried about the capacity of some NHS trusts to honour the pay review body's recommendations, and about recent proposals for performance-related pay for nursing staff. They are worried that the assessment of performance may be disadvantageous to nurses who work in small hospitals because the criteria may be based more on quantity than on quality. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary, in his reply to the debate, could assure the Committee that the performance of nurses in small hospitals will include an understanding of the great responsibilities that they sometimes undertake because they are not able to call so readily on specialised services.<br><br>
Anxiety exists in parts of mid Wales about the way in which cuts are imposed. The Ceredigion and Mid-Wales trust has asked staff to identify potential savings to enable the trust to honour the 1994 pay award. I hope that savings will not put services at peril.<br><br>
My next point deals with GP's experience. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) will have received representations from a group practice that is based in his constituency. Those representations were also made to me. The doctors in that practice claim that they experience difficulties when they refer patients to specific hospitals. They referred especially to the reluctance of Neville Hall hospital to accept references from doctors without first obtaining an assurance that Powys health authority would pay for the treatment. I hope that doctors will be able to continue to refer patients to a nearby local hospital where they believe that the most suitable treatment is available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman will share my concern that although the letter was sent to us, it was sent to the newspapers as well. It drew a response from Powys health authority, refuting some of the allegations made in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that the letter had been sent to the newspapers, but its points are worth considering.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
My final point deals with care in the community. I wish to refer especially to the care of mentally and physically handicapped people. In my constituency, two hospitals, Bryn Hyfryd and Llys Maldwyn, receive mentally and physically handicapped patients, but they are experiencing great difficulty in sending many of their patients into the community. That is particularly true of the Llys Maldwyn hospital at Caersws, so I hope that the Welsh Office will reappraise the needs of those patients. I have visited Llys Maldwyn hospital many times and I know many of the patients and staff. It is clear that a residue of patients cannot meaningfully be catered for by what is understood now by care in the community.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State will accept advice that it will be necessary to provide a continuing form of institutional care in the health service or through social service for that residue of patients. That care should continue to involve the nursing and medical staff who have looked after those patients so brilliantly for many years. The high level of hour-by-hour care that is needed for some patients—those in a chronic, near vegetative state—should continue to be available. There are genuine worries that care in the community will be difficult to find for such patients or, if found, that it will not be of sufficient quality.<br><br>
I echo what has been said about the need for respite care. Many of my constituents lovingly and bravely look after handicapped relatives throughout the year. Cuts have been made in the social service day respite provision because of a shortage of funding. It is also becoming difficult for parents and other relatives to find long-term respite provision, so that they can go away on holiday and have a break from the rigours of caring for a severely handicapped person. I hope that the Welsh Office will regard it as its responsibility to ensure that such care is as widely available as possible.</span></p>
<p>12.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we are all aware, the subject for today's debate is health and health care. Most hon. Members have concentrated on health care and, because of the time, I shall not repeat the points that they have made. I shall concentrate on health in Wales. In doing that, I wish to draw the obvious links between bad health and poverty and deprivation in our communities. To state an obvious fact, if we want to begin to overcome bad health, we must overcome the problems of poverty and deprivation.<br><br>
Not many places in Wales have the mixture of deprivation and bad health that is found in Blaenau Gwent. I want to emphasise that point and illustrate some of the problems of poverty and deprivation in that area and show how they affect standards of health. The Welsh Office has admitted that Blaenau Gwent is the second poorest borough in Wales. More than 70 per cent. of council tenants receive help with their rent and about 40 per cent. qualify for 100 per cent. rebates. The percentage of children receiving free school meals is way above the national average. More than 40 per cent. of housing was built before 1914 and much of that housing is in a bad state of repair. In addition, 37 per cent. of households include a pensioner and, in 1992, about half of those pensioners qualified for a rebate on poll tax and 20 per cent. were poor enough to receive the maximum payment.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
The two biggest causes of poverty in our communities are unemployment and low wages. In Blaenau Gwent, the figure for unemployment, with its consequential effect of ill health, is far above the national average, and the position is not improving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give the Committee a progress report on the new community hospital in Ebbw Vale?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has listened. I have about 65 seconds to speak. I said that I would concentrate on the causes of ill-health rather than health care. If the sitting can be extended to the afternoon, I shall be willing to enlarge my contribution into the subject of health care. I am commenting on a serious matter. If the hon. Gentleman cares to visit my constituency he will see just how serious it is.<br><br>
Some colleagues and I recently did substantial research on deprivation in Blaenau Gwent. Among the exercises we undertook were collecting and collating information. We also interviewed people in one street of 94 adults of whom more than 50 per cent. were unemployed. I am not saying that that is typical of Blaenau Gwent: what I do say is that there are pockets of extreme poverty in that community.<br><br>
Low pay is the other major factor that causes deprivation and affects health. The Department of Employment has produced a table of jobs advertised in jobcentres throughout the borough in mid May, together with wage rates. The figures are interesting. They were produced not by the Labour party or the BBC but by the Department of Employment. The jobs available in Blaenau Gwent included the following: a care assistant at £4 per hour; a machinist at £ 120 per week; a shop assistant at £3.08 per hour; a food service assistant at £2.70 and a security guard at £2.30. The more technical job of bingo caller was available at about £3.10. Where the hourly rate of remuneration was given, the average rate for all jobs advertised was the grand sum of £3.30. Perhaps hon. Gentlemen can tell me how anyone can raise a family and avoid many of the health problems referred to when the main earner in that family receives only £3.30 an hour before deductions.<br><br>
The main factor affecting poor health is deprivation. I will highlight some of Blaenau Gwent's problems. Forty-one per cent. of families have one person suffering from either long-term sickness or registered disablement. The social services has 4,200 residents registered with a physical disability. These are not only older members of the community who have perhaps worked in the coal and steel industries or in heavy industry; there are young people among them. If young people suffer bad health, their future opportunities for obtaining decently paid employment—or indeed any employment—will be affected.<br><br>
The figures for respiratory diseases, heart disease and lung cancer in Blaenau Gwent are all above the county and national averages. Deaths from heart disease are not far behind Scotland's, and Scotland has one of the worst records in Europe. Discussion of health in Wales must also include discussion of poverty and deprivation. If we are interested in overcoming the problems of bad health, the best way to proceed is to attack deprivation and poverty in our communities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
In the past 15 years, unemployment has been increasing; low pay has become an increasing phenomenon; bad housing, hazardous working conditions and low welfare benefits are increasingly becoming the norm in communities such as mine in Blaenau Gwent. Unfortunately, in the past decade or so, the Government have attacked them all.<br><br>
In 1997, in Blaenau Gwent and throughout the world, people will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nye Bevan's birth. We all know of his contribution in setting up the NHS. We can do something good for Nye. We can recognise his contribution. The best way to do that is to ensure that in 1997 we remove the Conservatives from office and, in so doing, we shall begin to remove some of the major problems that cause bad health in Wales.</span></p>
<p>12.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that when I moved to the Front Bench, albeit briefly, I should get a little longer than when on the Back Benches, but that seems not to be so.<br><br>
The debate has been wide-ranging and I shall not attempt in my 10 minutes to cover all the points mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lightbown (Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seven minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is 10 minutes.<br><br>
Several issues have been raised and I shall comment on a couple of them. In particular, those raised in interventions by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) need tackling. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) made some good observations, especially about the costs of community care and means testing—an issue with which the Government must deal.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) and, in an intervention, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon mentioned the new hospital at Neath and Port Talbot. This wrangle has been going on for 10 years and needs to be sorted out as quicky as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor mentioned this year's settlement. That issue deserves much examination and in the brief time left to me I shall try to touch on that and on the issue that the Secretary of State mentioned a great deal in his remarks—that is, administrative costs in the national health service.<br><br>
It is extremely rich for the Secretary of State—no doubt the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State would say the same thing—to try to claim credit for getting rid of bureaucrats when, in fact, the Government put them in place by introducing the internal market to the national health service.<br><br>
The impact of the problems caused by the massive increase in administrative costs and the problems in this year's settlement indicate that throughout Wales—not simply in Pembrokeshire on which the Secretary of State commented—there are serious problems, not merely in relation to job losses for administrators but job losses among the caring staff in the NHS.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that the health authority and the trust in Pembrokeshire are getting together to try
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
to solve the problem. However, the problem is massive: they are trying to save £1.9 million this year. A document, which is under discussion, has been produced, but it is not simply about administrative jobs but possible cutbacks in speech therapy, chiropody, physiotherapy, the health promotion budget, health visitors and district and school nurses are all being examined. There is a threat to the community services. There is a possibility—only a remote one, I am assured—that two hospitals could close. That would be how they could achieve that £1.9 milion saving. Therefore, let us not be carried away with what the Secretary of State tells us—that this is purely about men in grey suits. It is about a threat to direct patient care. However, such things are not just happening in Pembrokeshire; in Carmarthen, the chief executive has written to his members of staff saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"The cost of funding the pay awards to the Trust is approximately £750,000 … All staff must however appreciate that the Trust will have to fund the wage and salary awards through increased efficiency and productivity which could well result in a reduction in jobs."</p></blockquote>
My understanding, from further questioning by the health trade unions, is that that applies across the board, not exclusively in administration.<br><br>
In Powys there are also serious problems. Staff are being warned that there could be redundancies across the board if they cannot make the necessary efficiency savings. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery has already touched on the point that in the Credigion and Mid-Wales trust, there are serious problems. South Glamorgan must find cuts of £5 million. The University Hospital of Wales is looking to make cuts of 150 staff this year. Trusts in Swansea and Bridgend have warned of redundancies. Jean Fitzpatrick, the full-time official of the Royal College of Nursing, has said that every trust in Wales is making similar statements. They must find cuts somewhere to fund the 3 per cent. pay award so rightly awarded to doctors, nurses and midwives.<br><br>
The allegations of serious problems are not being made by the Labour party but by people who have been appointed to the trusts or are chairman or chief executives of those trusts. Derek Morgan—whose letter has been referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West and others—drew the Secretary of State's attention to the fact that, first, the level of the pay settlement was insufficient. Secondly, the timing of that settlement—a fortnight before the financial year was due to start—was causing enormous planning problems. The allegations are being made not only by Opposition Members and the health unions, but by people in senior posts.<br><br>
It is worth examining what financial impact that settlement has had on Welsh health authorities. Let us make some comparisons with what has happened in England because it is not only the way in which the award was announced but also the amounts that were significantly different in England and Wales. On 7 December, the Secretary of State for Health announced a 5.4 per cent. overall increase for the regional health authorities. On that day she also fisted what each regional health authority in England would get.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Redwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. On 17 December, the Secretary of State announced the 4.3 per cent. overall increase for the district health authorities in Wales, but not how it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
would be apportioned. On 16 March, many months after the English bodies knew what they had received, the health authorities in Wales were informed. For many, particularly Powys, the figures are catastrophic. The increase that the Powys health authority will have to distribute to providers of health care is 0.7 per cent. In Pembrokeshire, it is 2.9 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No way. In South Glamorgan, the figure is 2.05 per cent. In West Glamorgan, it is 2.6 per cent. and, in Mid-Glamorgan, 2.9 per cent.<br><br>
It is interesting—this point was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith)—that when we consider which areas of Wales are the worst for limiting long-term illness, according to the 1991 survey, of all the 651 constituencies in the whole of Britain, 10 of the top 12 are in Mid-Glamorgan, East Dyfed or Gwent. Those authorities have received a maximum increase in funding of 2.9 per cent. in the case of Mid-Glamorgan and a minimum of 2.4 per cent. in the case of East Dyfed. The constituency with the least limiting long-term illness is that of the Secretary of State for Wales—Wokingham has the best health care record in the whole of Britain. What did the regional health authority in the Secretary of State's constituency receive in cash uplift? Not the 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. that was awarded in Wales, but an increase of 6 per cent. That is indicative of the problems in Wales. We have serious, recognised health problems, which require cash, but we do not receive it Areas in England, which have their own health concerns, but which are nothing like as difficult important or great as the problems in Wales, receive twice as much money. That is totally unfair and it is time that the Secretary of State addressed that issue.</span></p>
<p>12.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me congratulate the hon. Member for Pembroke on his first appearance on the Opposition Front Bench. He certainly raised the standard of debate on the Opposition Benches. Having heard the speeches today from the Opposition Front Bench, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already received his first birthday present. If that is all that the Opposition have to say about the health service in Wales my right hon. Friend has nothing to worry about and there is nothing much wrong with the health service in Wales.<br><br>
I know that the Opposition fought the European election on a totally negative basis. Of course, it was that sort of election. The media never focus on the Opposition to ask what they have to say. I wait with some interest to see whether the contest between Mr. Bland and Mr. Angry will be conducted on an equally negative basis. The people of Wales are entitled to expect better from the Welsh Grand Committee and to hear what their elected representatives have to say. I am sure that the people of Wales will be scanning long and hard to try to find any positive contributions from the Opposition Benches. I appreciate what was said by the hon. Member for Neath. I am sure that, beneath the sound bites that he insisted on using, he has genuine apprehensions about the changes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
in health care provision for his constituency and for Port Talbot. I imagine that his apprehensions have already been considered by the health authorities in West Glamorgan. But, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already stated, all that he said must be fully considered as we evaluate the plans put forward by the West Glamorgan health authorities and we intend to announce our decision on the proposals for Baglan and the other matters as soon as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ynys Mon started by hinting at a positive approach. He said that he accepted that changes in the national health service were necessary, but he went on to deal, in all the tired political cliches about underfunding and waiting lists. He ignored the increasing numbers of patients who are being treated by the health service in Wales. I give him some statistics. There were 2.6 million out-patients in 1979. In 1993, there were 3.3 million. That is an increase of almost 30 per cent. There were 350,000 in-patients in 1979. In 1993, there were more than half a million. That is an increase of 44 per cent. The number of day patients has gone up by a staggering 426 per cent. The hon. Gentleman complains about underfunding and waiting lists. But if we returned to the level of underfunding during the previous Labour-Liberal Government, which was also propped up by Plaid Cymru, 1 million patients a year in Wales would be denied treatment. That is the extent of the additional treatment being provided.<br><br>
The tone of our debate was set by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor when he referred to that tone as sad but predictable. The hon. Gentleman went through a litany of subjects—Scotland, money, management numbers, the Common Services Authority and community care. I listened patiently and heard not one positive contribution. To use his own words, it was naught but bladder relief. His only positive contribution to this important debate on the health service in Wales was to refer to our consultation document. We look forward eagerly to everyone's views about the future of the health authorities. All the hon. Gentleman could offer was to defer. Perhaps I should refer to him as the honourable Word Processor for Cardiff, West. He specialises in packing many words into a minute and, as anyone who has operated a word processor knows, although the words might be spelt correctly according to the spellcheck, that does not mean that they make any sense. GIGO comes to mind—garbage in, garbage out. The <i>South Wales Echo</i> on Saturday used a word that might fit the hon. Gentleman's style of contribution—"bullshi'ing".<br><br>
I was especially surprised by the negative references made by the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) to his constituency. Why did he not refer to the increased number of patients being treated by the Pembrokeshire national health service trust? I have seen the figures which are the greatest ever. In the past year, more than 150,000 patients were treated at Withybush hospital. That is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
very credible figure. All the targets in the patients charter are being met by Pembrokeshire NHS trust. It is rightly discussing ways of being more efficient. The national health service trust is discussing with the health authority ways of achieving additional activity so that it can continue to cut waiting lists in Pembrokeshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to give way on another occasion, but time is against me today.<br><br>
Pembrokeshire NHS trust was the first part of the NHS in Wales that I visited when I became health Minister in the Welsh Office. I have followed it closely ever since. I believe that it will continue to make progress in Pembrokeshire for the local people. I am only sorry that it does not have the support of the local Members of Parliament.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor for his contributions. I readily appreciate his concern about the Powys figure being based on the capitation formula. I assure him that we shall continue to examine carefully the funding that should be made available to Powys, as we must do for the other health authorities in Wales. We shall try to relate that closely to the health needs of the relevant populations. That is my response to the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent.<br><br>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor is pleased that we have been able to appoint a salaried dentist for Builth Wells. I note what he said about Presteigne and I shall consider that matter carefully. I also listened to what the hon. and learned Member for Montomery said. I too visited Llys Maldwyn. He might want to study the new guidance that we are going to issue on the mental handicap strategy. I also note what he said about nurses and not wanting a deterioration in services. That is also our wish. Although we want efficiencies to make the health service more effective, we want services to be maintained. We do not want money simply going towards pay increases and away from patient care.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend said, today is a day of good news. The Committee should take satisfaction from the fact that all the targets in the patients charter are being achieved, not least the reductions in the out-patient waiting list. The health service in Wales is making excellent progress and it will continue to do so, but there will be no complacency. We are determined to continue to tackle any unnecessary expenditure. We want the greatest amount of the money spent at the bedside so that Wales will be provided with the very best health care system.</span></p>
