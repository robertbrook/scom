	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Redwood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of Education Standards in Wales."</p></blockquote>
I wish to pay tribute to the many fine teachers and good schools in Wales. The best are excellent and serve their pupils well. Their students do well at exams, have their minds broadened and stretched and leave well equipped to obtain a worthwhile job or to go on to further study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to report that, following the introduction of the national curriculum and our other reforms—not always welcomed by Opposition Members, who now welcome the progress that we are making—the average standard has been rising. Last year, it rose quite sharply. That is good news for schools, good news for Wales and cause for words of praise and encouragement. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that Opposition Members agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that those are not the contentious issues. Today I want to ask some other, more fundamental, questions. Why do some schools do so much better than others? Why do schools that spend least, often do better than those that spend most? What should we expect, especially of our primary schools? In short, what makes a good school in the public sector?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect opposition today to our aims. We all want better results. I hope that Opposition Members share our desire for four out of five school leavers to obtain five good GCSEs or the equivalent, and for one in two to obtain two A-levels or the equivalent. We want to strengthen vocational as well as academic studies. I expect more lively debate about what goes on in primary schools and how well pupils should do, especially in less well-off areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to consider two contrasts. Cardiff High spends £1,809 per pupil—one of the lowest costs in Wales—and achieves the best results, with 71 per cent. obtaining five good GCSEs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister's follow-up comparison is, but if it is the same one that has appeared in the newspapers it is obviously not a comparison of like with like. To ignore the social background of the pupils who go to those schools is to do an injustice to the children, the parents and the teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we should not ignore the social background. I also agree that we should offer
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
more money, therefore more teaching, to the areas with the greatest problems, but I should like the hon. Gentleman to bear with me as I develop my argument on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Dynevor school in Swansea, which spends £2,649 per pupil—one of the highest costs in Wales—only 5 per cent. obtain five good GCSEs. Some will say that the difference between the two schools I have mentioned is written in the stars because of the point that the hon. Gentleman made about background, so I shall contrast Dynevor school with Glanafan school in Port Talbot, where 42 per cent. of pupils obtain five good GCSEs and which spends only £2,206 per pupil. Put more bluntly, a pupil at Glanafan school has an eight in 20 chance of opening the door to a good job or university place, whereas a pupil at Dynevor school has a one in 20 chance. The gap between the best and the worst is too great.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he wanted to develop his argument and the comparisons. Will he develop the argument by comparing Cardiff High with Cwmcarn grant-maintained school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that since Cwmcarn school became grant maintained it has experienced one of the sharpest improvements in performance, albeit from a low level. That shows why the school needed that action and how it is beginning to work. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will welcome that improvement instead of knocking the way in which it is happening. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Cardiff West (Mr. Morgan) is intervening from a sedentary position. If he wants to debate the matter further I shall be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State agree that Cwmcarn did not experience improvement immediately after it became grant maintained, but finished bottom of the league for examination results in Wales? Only subsequently has it improved—after all, it could hardly decline from where it was. The word "since" normally means subsequent to and not before. Does the Minister agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to dispute the meaning of "since", but I shall dispute the underlying point. Cwmcarn is now achieving better results because it has gone grant maintained and adopted new practices and I believe that that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to narrow the gap, as I hope Opposition Members do, between the poor performers and the better performers and I want to achieve that by improving the performance of the worst. The gap between the two town centre schools that I have described shows that it is not just a question of the home backgrounds of students. The gap between the three schools I have chosen is certainly not a gap that extra cash has narrowed so far. Dynevor in Swansea spends 46 per cent. more than Cardiff High, and 20 per cent. more than Glanafan. I want to discourage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
fiscal fatalism—the belief that everything comes from the Secretary of State's cheque book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has made comparisons between individual schools, but Swansea is in West Glamorgan, which has registered a considerable improvement in standards in comparison with, for example, South Glamorgan. How can that be accounted for within the patterns of expenditure that the Secretary of State has mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a valuable and sensible contribution. In a way he supports my case. A variety of factors leads to an improvement in schools, as I shall illustrate, and although money can come in helpful in some cases, there is no simple correlation between more money and better performance, as the results show all too clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a young soldier was asked recently on television why he was putting himself through gruelling trials to become a commando, he replied, "If you're going to do it, be the best." If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing well. Every day, every week, many people in Wales put themselves to the test in their own way—on the rugby ground, at the village show, in business, on the ice rink or at school. It is a truth that some schools do better than others. That is not a truth that some Opposition Members seem to like, but it is a truth none the less. However it is not a permanent truth; the order is neither pre-ordained nor fixed immutably. If we wish to shape the future, we should gain a good grip on the present. To live in ignorance of the results is to bury our heads in the sand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Opposition Members have objected to measuring results, yet they have all accepted, I think, measurements at 16 when children have to leave for a job or for advanced study. Those same hon. Members cavil at the measurement of schools' performance and say that it is not fair, that it does not reveal all that we need to know about a school, or that it does not take into account the background of the children or the prosperity of the catchment area. They sell the students of Wales short by those weasel words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can one seriously believe that the absence of a car in the garage at home means that a child cannot add up, that the inability to go abroad on holiday means that a child cannot grasp the rudiments of geography, or that having a father out of work is an incentive to play truant and disregard the educational ladder of opportunity? I challenge the Opposition to deal with their arguments more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, of course, that some families give more support and encouragement than others and that family break-up puts strains on young children. A minority of parents fail to tell their children that doing well at school matters, but politicians and social workers should not encourage that. If the parents are
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
trapped by unemployment or a lack of skill, there is all the more reason for their children to strive for something better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to return to the basic truth—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—of an old Welsh saying, that the best weapon is the weapon of education; gorau arf arf dysg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely one of the key basics is to be honest and to speak only about that of which one has direct and personal experience. From time to time the Secretary of State has lectured us in Wales about standards. Will he say whence he derives his information and evidence? How many of our schools has he visited personally? Has he spoken to teachers and parents? The only school in Swansea that I know his Minister of State has visited is the opted-out school, which is hardly a good signal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am careful to read all the evidence and to visit schools when I can. I have read many inspectors' reports and information prepared by my officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment later on one of my most recent visits to a primary school in Wales. I believe in supplementing what I read with visits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child cannot travel to Constantinople or Timbuktu, let him travel there in the imagination. Much of education is a flight of fancy from the armchair or the desk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State used the words "basic truth". Will he acknowledge that some time ago when he visited the St Mellons estate in my constituency, he used the visit as an opportunity to mislead the press and the public about the estate? Will he acknowledge that the estate should be famous for the first-rate effort that has been made by the people who live there, the police and the local community to combat the problems of the area, and that their success in working together has been reflected by a drop in crime? It would be nice if the Secretary of State were to acknowledge that basic truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have ever denied that. I am delighted that the local community and the police are co-operating and making progress. Following my visit, I was able to help from the Welsh Office with some of the programmes and policies that are being developed in that area. Of course I send every good wish to that area and I hope that there will be further improvements. If the Welsh Office can help, it will under my leadership. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is wrong to deny that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State misses out the local authorities, which have played a very important part, with local residents and the police, in putting life back into that area. He has not acknowledged that his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
misleading comments did enormous damage and caused great offence in the area. After a few minutes' visit, he made comments which were a complete misrepresentation of the nature of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech that I made following my visit was in a different place and did not refer to St Mellons. The hon. Gentleman should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child is not taken to see Harlech castle or the Palace of Westminster by his parents, let him drink in the atmosphere of our past from books, films and accounts. If children's homework is disrupted by rows or rowdiness at home, maybe the school should stay open for an extra hour to provide a haven in which homework can be done, because it is important that every assistance be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools inspectors have discovered that, in some of the weaker schools, there are too many deputy heads and senior posts without subject responsibilities and that policy frameworks take priority over classroom teaching. In too many Welsh schools, children are not even taught for the recommended minimum number of hours a week. Why are one quarter of all the lessons in Welsh primary schools adjudged unsatisfactory by the independent inspectorate? Because they break the five rules of good teaching set out by the inspectors, based on their great experience of success in the classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us what progress is being made with training the new inspectors? What percentage of them, before training, have had no direct experience of schools, apart from going to school about 30 or 50 years ago?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's memory of how inspectors work and are trained is a little hazy, but I shall ensure that the factual question is answered by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State when he replies. I do not know the percentage figure that the hon. Gentleman seeks. I can assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the inspectors achieve very high standards and that they have good information about what works and does not work in the classroom. I value their reports and think that governors and other people interested in education in Wales should also value their reports. The inspectors are independent people who care about standards and they deserve the support of all men and women of good will in Wales, whatever their political views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inspectors believe that good lessons have five essential characteristics. First, each group of lessons should "be a positive attack on specified aims or objectives". Secondly, they should include a planned variety. Thirdly, teachers should have clear and high expectations of pupils. Fourthly, teachers should seek the active involvement of their pupils. Fifthly, there should be a substantial and influential response by teachers to pupils' work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the inspectors are saying that teachers should know what they are doing, expect
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
high standards, keep the students alert and interested, and mark and comment in detail on pupils' work. Many fine teachers and head teachers throughout Wales are doing that already, but all of them must do it so that all schools and pupils have an equal task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the stream of quotations from the bumper book of banalities that the Secretary of State has been giving us this morning, but does he realise that what he is saying is so obvious and so patronising that it gives offence? Will he take a look at the parents' charter, which is in very much the same vein? It too, contains a string of banal advice to parents. For example, it tells them to give their children breakfast before sending them to school. It has cost £2 million to produce and will be delivered to 20 million homes, but it is entirely unnecessary. It is both offensive and counter-productive for the Government to operate in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Opposition say that we want nursery education for all, we do not mean that we want patronising drivel written in Janet and John language; we do not mean nursery-level education for adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the first part of his intervention the hon. Gentleman supported my remarks; he said that what I was saying was obvious, which implied his consent. I am delighted that Opposition Members agree with me and the inspectors about what is needed for high-quality teaching and good results in Welsh schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the hon. Gentleman wants to know about the progress that is being made in nursery education in Wales, so he may like to know that 70 per cent. of three and four-year-olds in Wales attend either a state or private nursery and that the rising fives usually get a school place. The situation is good and improving, and in some of the areas with the least satisfactory results in primary and secondary schools the percentages of pupils who attend is higher. An effort is being made to correct the problems that Opposition Members see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will the Government redeem the former Prime Minister's promise that nursery education would be made available to all three and four-year-olds who require it? The present Prime Minister has also said that he is anxious to ensure that nursery education is provided for all who require it. What the Secretary of State has just said hardly reassures us about the Government's commitment to nursery education. Will he concede that we are at the bottom of the pile of European Union countries who provide nursery education, that the value to children—both at the age at which they receive it and throughout their lives—of nursery education is now well established and that it is a shocking shame that we have not made that education available to our children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made the Government's commitment to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
nursery education clear. He has also made it clear that it is a prime responsibility of local education authorities, which have to make their own decisions on priorities in light of the money that we give them and that they collect from their tax payers. Many authorities are now achieving high levels of nursery provision, especially in Wales, and I do not think that the hon. Lady is correct to assert that Wales is at the bottom of the European pack on the matter. She has provided another example of someone giving deliberate misinformation to the Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the task of head teachers and governors to encourage the best standards in teaching, to make wise appointments, to back up enthusiastic staff who are delivering and to have a quiet word or two with any who are letting the side down. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members say that that is banal and trivial, but it is important. There are some governing bodies that clearly have not been asking enough hard questions or taking enough remedial action to get the right teaching to the right pupils. I am challenging the governing bodies of that minority of schools that are not doing as well as we would like to get to the bottom of why they are not succeeding and to help to take action to correct the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take issue with the Secretary of State because he is now issuing a condemnation of governing bodies throughout Wales. Will he, during or at the end of the debate, publish a list of governing bodies that he feels are not achieving the standards that he is now laying down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have already produced a list of schools' achievements. I would like—and I hope Opposition Members would like—some of the schools on that list to do better. I am saying that we all—including the governors—have a role to play in achieving that. If governors of schools where the results are very poor are concerned, I hope that they will ask questions. This is not a banality; it is an important truth about the governors' role and responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already produced a list of Welsh schools' performances. It is up to those schools' governors to decide whether there is anything that they can do to improve matters by appointing new teachers when the opportunity arises, by encouraging the head teacher to produce better standards or by investigating, with the head teacher, to see what can be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members always promote the pathetic fallacy that the only person who can do anything about schools' problems is the Secretary of State for Wales. It is the duty of local education authorities, governors, head teachers and teachers to do what they can to provide the necessary impetus. The governors' role is to praise and promote the school and to ensure that all is praiseworthy. The head teacher is the leader
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of the school, the standard setter and the first among equals, who must lead from the front and by example. There are many fine examples of that happening in Wales. We need to ensure that it happens everywhere.

I recently visited a small village school, which had 54 pupils, near Builth. I saw good work under way in an atmosphere in which teachers wanted to teach. It was a reminder that arguments about size, structure and money are far less important than what goes on in the classroom and the commitment given by both teacher and pupil. Teaching pupils who do not want to learn is not easy. Stamping out truancy is an important first task. If a child absents himself too often, catching up is difficult, if not impossible. The thread is broken; success is unlikely. The Welsh Office is determined to help schools and LEAs clamp down on truancy. That is why I have taken a special interest in curbing truancy.

I am told that some teachers in England think that to expect seven-year-olds to read 30 basic words is an unreasonable request dreamt up by Ministers. I have a simple answer for them: nonsense. 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> ran a story about 1,400 primary schools complaining about that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I shall explain. I am delighted not to have been told that Welsh schools share the concern. That is a sign that teachers in Wales are aware of the need to teach reading and writing well. I am proud of the fact that they do that and dissociate themselves from crazy views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can a child be said to be able to read, if that child cannot recognise and pronounce 30 basic words? How can we say that seven-year-olds are too young to be able to read? I do not profess to know the best method or methods of teaching reading. That is a matter for schools and teachers to decide, based on their experience and training, but I know that seven-year-old Welsh children should be able to read and I believe that some structure in a child's day, with some formal instruction and correction of sloppy work, is essential to success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also told that some teachers in England think that 11 to 14-year-olds should not be expected to read any author who wrote before 1900—whether on a list or an amended list. Those teachers want to deny children the brilliance of the metaphysical poets, the grandeur of Milton, the elegance of the 18th century prose writers, the intensity of the romantics, the 19th century novelists and—if that attitude were to be adopted in Wales—the great Welsh literary tradition. I am pleased to say that, according to my advisers, Welsh teachers are again pioneering a different view and see the importance of great literature to the teaching of English in schools. We cannot afford to say that it is impossible to select three groups of poems or novels from the works of such greats as Donne, Swift, Johnson, Keats, Dickens, Shelley,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Austen, Eliot, Wordsworth, Kipling, and Lewis Carroll. There can be plenty of choice on the list. [Hon. Members:"Name Welsh writers."] I shall come to Welsh writers, if Members will be patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those teachers say that there should be no "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" or "Through the Looking-Glass", no "Tintern Abbey" and no "Just-So Stories"—in effect no British literature. I trust that Welsh teachers appreciate the strength of Welsh tradition, which includes the Mabinogion. I know many Welsh people enjoy reading that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great 20th century writers, but Eliot, Pound and Joyce are even more difficult to understand than the greats of the 17th and 19th centuries. We cannot enthuse a winning generation with the pap of mid-century social commentators and recent popular culture.

If children read badly, they will write badly. If they read and write badly, they will think badly.

Does he realise that many children will never be able to go for gold?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the thrust of the argument that special education is important.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the task of good education to find that which all pupils can achieve and of which they can be proud, and to discover the spark and encourage pupils to enjoy and do well in something, whatever their ability. That is what the best teachers achieve every day and every week. We are in their debt for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The politically correct in education have been the downfall of standards. A teacher recently said, "Do not see 'Romeo and Juliet'—it is too heterosexual." We should tell our children that "Romeo and Juliet" is the finest exploration of romantic love in the English language or in dance. I am glad that Shakespeare wrote "Romeo and Juliet" and not "Romeo and Julian", and so are most people in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Secretary of State that the debate is about educational standards in Wales. What has the fact that one headmistress did not allow pupils to go to see "Romeo and Juliet" got to do with that? I have heard of no such example in Wales. English teachers there are keen on their pupils being able to see Shakespeare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am drawing a favourable contrast between advice coming from teachers in England and what we are achieving in Wales. I am glad that Welsh teachers have sensible views and standards in those matters, because that is one of the keys to good achievements in our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some theorists have said, "let the child wander round the 'resources area' and he will discover things for himself." I do not believe in that ambulatory principle. I have never met a child who was able to discover the keys to the universe unaided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some teachers say, "Don't push the child to do things he can't do." How will he ever learn? I am all for a good project, which can be enriching and encouraging. If a child is to do it, however, it helps if he can read, spell, punctuate, multiply and divide to a good standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some teachers tell me that it is unrealistic to expect punctuation and that it cramps a child's imagination and style. Written language becomes meaningless without commas and full stops, question marks and exclamations. Spoken language is meaningless without cadence and intonation. Growing up is about disciplining the mind and the emotions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1920s and 1930s, when times were hard in the valleys, many showed a fierce stoicism. They valued their independence. Families in poverty made proud statements such as: "My mother never went to the soup kitchen; my father never accepted charity. We may not have much, but we have our pride." Fortunately, times have improved dramatically. We do not have to experience those conditions in an age of many more jobs, housing benefit and income support. It would be a pity, though, to lose that intense spark of dignity that is our inheritance. It is what is needed to drive us to higher achievement in school and college and to keep alive the hope and promise of a better tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Government are doing. The best of Welsh education is excellent. The average standard is rising. Stretching targets have been set and we should all work to hit them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State chose the subject of today's debate, but I have rarely heard such a collection of populism, prejudice and platitudes. We should not be surprised by that. The Secretary of State said much the same earlier this week when he attended what I assume was a mass meeting of Rhondda Conservatives. He issued a press release—or the Conservative office in Wales issued a press release in the name of the Secretary of State for Wales. I was so taken aback by the appalling English in the press release that I asked a colleague, Mr. John Rogers, a lecturer in English language at Crosskeys tertiary college—which is top of the Government's league tables in south-east Wales—what he thought of it. He marked it and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lines 3 and 4: opening and closing quotation marks are omitted. In addition, the comma in this sentence is redundant …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Line 8: "aide" is the wrong spelling …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Line 13: apostrophe omitted in 'Inspectors'."</p></blockquote>
He concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The real art of the whole piece, of course, has been to combine these classic errors with several examples of awkward or ugly expression. These are too numerous to detail here, but they certainly add the final touch of verisimilitude to this deliciously awful example of English prose."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say that were he to mark it in GCSE grade terms, he, as an expert in English language, would
	<br><blockquote><p>"award a borderline C/D, with a recommendation that the candidate"—</p></blockquote>
that is, presumably, the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"take an intensive course on basic grammar and punctuation."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to return the compliment, if I could see the written critique of my speech, and happy to return the compliment to the hon. Gentleman when I have heard his speech. I am sure that marking would be good for him as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would indeed. I spent 17 years marking essays as a teacher, which has made me suspicious of some of the points that the Secretary of State has made today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on education standards in Wales is not new. If the Secretary of State thinks that he is breaking new ground, he is mistaken. For example, in 1982, the faculty of education at University college Cardiff issued a special report on the educational state of Wales. The debate has gone on for 20 or so years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate never gripped the Secretary of State's predecessor, the right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt). In 1992, he went to a conference in Pontypridd with me and told secondary school heads that head teachers
	<br><blockquote><p>"should not be defensive on the issue of performance: most have a proud record in many areas."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State finished his speech by talking
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
about leadership. There is no question but that it is important for head teachers and senior teachers to be able to give leadership. The inspector's report recently said that it was important to
	<br><blockquote><p>"monitor and assess the quality of the work of teachers and pupils."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State omitted to say that, over the past 10 years or so, head teachers and senior staff have been inundated by requests from his Department to fill in forms and compile statistics. Their ability to do what the Secretary of State wants has been much diminished by the bureaucracy and nonsense that emanates from the Welsh Office—including the league tables. I am sure that the Secretary of State would say that education standards in Wales are improved by league tables, but the opposite is the case. Schools that he puts at the bottom of the league—such as Cwmcarn, Wales's first grant-maintained school—often find themselves in a position from which it is hard to improve, because public perceptions of them have been set in concrete. The other effect of league tables—compared, for example, with the position in England—is that they make schools in Wales disinclined to enter young people for examinations unless they are guaranteed to pass them. What the Secretary of State is saying about underachievement is total nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be as pessimistic as the Secretary of State about the state of education standards. The chief inspector, Mr. Roy James, spoke to teachers in Wales last year. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Standards in schools have never been higher. The experiences that pupils have now are richer, broader, more interesting and more relevant than ever before."</p></blockquote>
He repeated that assertion when he wrote his report only a couple of weeks ago. The President of the Welsh secondary schools association, Mr. John Booth, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Good comprehensive schools do more for all their pupils than grammar schools ever did … There has been much talk of standards, but standards have never been so high."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mr. Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman face the fact that, in the report to which he has just referred, the chief inspector said that no fewer than 25 per cent. of primary classes and 20 per cent. of secondary classes in Wales were less than satisfactory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed he did, but he did not say it in quite those words. He said that he was happy and satisfied that 75 per cent. of primary schools and 80 per cent. of secondary schools were doing well. That is an improvement on previous performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State spoke about the 1930s and unemployed miners. In the press release, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unemployed miners and quarrymen of the Wales of the 30s did not accept that their children were doomed to failure."</p></blockquote>
He also said that their children packed their satchels. I do not know what that is supposed to mean or what knowledge the Secretary of State has of unemployed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
miners in the 1930s, but I can tell him that my grandfather was an unemployed miner and my father was a miner then. The reason that I did not become a miner was nothing to do with the packing of satchels or whatever was supposed to have been done in the 1930s. The reason—and the reason why he and I were at the same university 25 years ago—was that we had a Labour Government and Labour-run councils such a Monmouthshire county council, which could provide the resources and opportunity for people such as me any many of my colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The romantic notions of a golden age of long ago have to be scotched. We must remember, when we talk about grammer schools, the 11-plus and selection, that most people were put on the scrap heap by the 11-plus and selection. That is why there is a massive adult education literacy programme to teach adults who failed at 11-plus to read and write.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State spoke about what he was doing for the valleys of south Wales. The valleys initiative hardly deals with education or schools at all. We would have to search high and low in those documents for any reference to education. Worse than that, only last week the House of Commons debated his rate support grant for the valleys. The amount of money that Mid Glamorgan, West Glamorgan and Gwent can spend on education has been severely slashed. It is important that the areas that are most deprived should receive Government money through the rate support grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman familiar with the report published by the Welsh Office entitled "Primary Education in Rural Wales?" The report said that most of the 583 schools in Wales were "deficient and unsatisfactory." It said that they were cramped and lacking in facilities, and that considerable expenditure would be needed to give them a future. The report was published in March 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not seen much improvement in those 15 years. One of the great problems is not simply this year's or last year's settlement; it is the constant underfunding of education, year after year, that causes the problems that we now face. The county of Clwyd will have to cut between £6 million and £7 million from its education budget. Teachers will have to be sacked to pay for the 2.9 per cent. pay rise. It will not improve education standards if we have to sack teachers, which will result in larger classes. The Secretary of State used an unoriginal phrase in his press release:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools do not live by cash alone."</p></blockquote>
That is nothing more than a general excuse for not properly funding all schools, whether in north, mid or south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's opportunity to improve education is not to be found in what the Secretary of State said this morning, but in the creation of the new unitary authorities. There will be 21 new education
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
authorities in Wales. However, the Local Government (Wales) Bill hardly mentions education. Indeed, education receives little mention in the White Paper. The experts rightly tell us that our advisory services, the special education service, staff development, educational psychology, music courses, drama and outdoor pursuits are at risk as a direct result of local government reorganisation in Wales—so much so, that in October 1993, the Minister of State for Wales was reported in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Welsh Office Minister, Sir Wyn Roberts, has urged schools to consider opting out of local authority control instead of facing the uncertainties of unitary authorities."</p></blockquote>
Yet they are the Minister's unitary authorities. He then urged heads to "ponder on that one." I pondered on 	<i>Hansard.</i> On the Second Reading of the Education Act 1993, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In terms of the delivery of service through the new unitary authorities, I do not envisage difficulties … We are confident that the move to unitary authorities will not adversely affect the provision of services to LEA … schools."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 March 1993; Vol. 220. 364–5.]</p></blockquote>
Ministers must make up their minds. Either the unitary authorities in Wales will be good for schools or they will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows full well that the Labour party's policy is for unitary authorities. It is also our policy to have governing bodies with proper accountability within a democratic framework. A Welsh Assembly would have an overall strategic view of education in the Principality.

My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) wrote recently to the Minister of State. He was bemused, as many of us are, about the road shows in Wales. The Minister of State has many qualities, but travelling through Wales like Jimmy Young is not one of them. The road shows were supposed to enthuse people about the benefits of grant-maintained schools. In his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke, the Minister of State said that the conferences, or road shows, are
	<br><blockquote><p>"not attempts to persuade schools to opt for grant-maintained status … They have been arranged in response to this high level of interest in grant-maintained status throughout Wales, including by schools in Dyfed."</p></blockquote>
In a parliamentary question, I asked the Minister about grant-maintained status in schools in Dyfed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and in the rest of Wales. There are 344 schools in Dyfed; one ballot has been held for grant-maintained status. That school decided to stay with the local education authority. That is the success of the roadshows. Of the 2,000 schools in Wales, only 18 have decided to apply for opt-out status. The Government would do well to redivert their energy and money from opt-outs, roadshows and so on to the coffers of the local education authorities, so that they can provide proper education for our young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not facing up to the problems. Is he aware that three years ago, only 66 per cent. of the schools' budget found its way to schools? With local management of schools, we have succeeded in increasing that percentage to just over 71 per cent. Does he really think that it is right that about two thirds of the schools' budget is finding its way to schools and that the rest is held by the local education authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has never said that there is anything wrong with the local management of schools. It is our official policy to continue with the local management of schools when a Labour Government are elected. However, we shall change the formula and ensure that proper resources are laid aside for vital services such as special education, music and drama and outdoor pursuits. There has to be a balance and the Government have not achieved it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend that the movement towards local management of schools and self-managed schools was pioneered principally by Labour local education authorities. As he rightly pointed out, the dispute during consideration of the Great Education Reform Bill—which lasted only four years—was over the funding formula and especially over the way in which the average and not the actual salary was taken for schools. It has undermined the policy pursued by many schools of keeping experienced staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take what my hon. Friend has said into account.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that we can reallocate the money that the Government are wasting on opt-out schools and the assisted places scheme. One of the allies of the Secretary of State, Professor David Reynolds—who has been writing
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
about under-achievement—says that under-achievement in Wales is best dealt with by dumping the policies of the Government. That is the important point. We should dump the assisted places scheme; it is irrelevant to Wales. We should dump the idea of market choice in Wales. In many parts of our country, there is no choice because of the geography. Professor Reynolds says that the Government's policies
	<br><blockquote><p>"are, at best, irrelevant to our culture and educational traditions, and, at worst, may be positively harmful to the prospects of our pupils … Whatever culture or country was in the minds of Government policy-makers when their educational reforms were framed, it certainly cannot have been Wales."</p></blockquote>
The last thing that Wales wants is a lecture about education from the Secretary of State and the Government because they have been in charge of education for 15 years. In that time, they have underfunded our schools and have had to back down on so-called reforms because of the pressure on the education community in Wales. They have destroyed proper democratic accountability in large parts of our education service and undermined morale in schools to such an extent that they have denigrated teachers. Five out of eight directors of education in Wales have chosen to resign specifically as a result of the Government's policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A former director of Powys education committee, Mr. Robert Bevan, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Competition on the sports field and in the market place is fine and healthy, but we are never able to forget that, when applied to the complex field of education, the defeated team is likely to be represented by the down-town school, and the bankrupt firm by the child with special needs."</p></blockquote>
Our schools are not businesses and our pupils are not numbers on an accounts sheet. We should deal with education as part of our community and local democracy. Our schools should be properly resourced, our teachers should be treated responsibly as professionals, and we should not interfere politically with the role of Her Majesty's Inspectorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sooner that the Secretary of State deals with those issues, instead of spending time on issuing weekly pronouncements on what is happening in education, the better it will be for all of us in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Sweeney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Teachers whom I met in my constituency struck me as extremely professional in their attitudes. However, when I listen to some of the utterances of the National Union of Teachers and other large teaching unions, I wonder whether they are representative of their members.

The teachers whom I met recognised the need for them, like other professional people, to go an extra
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
mile to assist children in their care who require additional help. I recall a case that demonstrates that point. It involved a teacher who had in her class of reception infants, a gipsy child who was having great difficulty in learning to read. Consultation in the staff room revealed that the child had two older siblings at the same school, neither of whom was able to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That teacher visited the gipsy parents at their caravan site and managed to persuade them to visit the school and take an interest in their children's work, a course of action that was unprecedented in that family. After that, the child learned to read and the parents would accompany it to the library to borrow books. The teacher also helped the two older siblings during the lunch hours and they, too, learned to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that story because it was one of my mother's first experiences when she entered the teaching profession in middle age. In 20 years of teaching infants, culminating in the headship of three small infant schools, she never encountered an ineducable child. Teachers who take that lesson to heart will agree that the need for remedial teaching in our secondary and upper schools would be greatly reduced if some children were better taught in primary schools.

A problem that has recently worried me is vandalism in schools. Bryn Hafren is an excellent girls school in Barry, with a large playing field that is not well fenced. Indeed, it is so large that it would be difficult to fence it effectively. Young people have been stealing cars, ramming their way through the fence, cavorting round the field, churning it up, wrecking the playing surface and vandalising the school buildings while they have been on the premises. Unfortunately, the cost of repairs comes out of the education budget. When my right hon. Friend the Minister sums up, I would welcome his comments on what local education authorities should be doing to provide ringfence funding—[Hon. Members: "For fences."] an appropriate choice of word—because it is wrong that children should lose out educationally as a result of the actions of hooligans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that concerns me is the condition of the buildings in some of the schools in my constituency. There is one particularly good school, which many members of the Committee will know is a famous grammar school—Cowbridge school, which is currently an excellent comprehensive school. Judging from academic league tables, it has the fourth best results in the whole of Wales. In recent years it has suffered, like many other schools, from dilapidation. Matters came to a head when there were so many holes in the roof that buckets had to be placed in most of the classrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited the school last summer, and I was told by the headmaster that South Glamorgan county council had agreed the previous year to replace the flat roof, provided that the school used its local management
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of schools budget to repair the ceilings. The school spent the summer repairing the ceilings, but, unfortunately, the county council failed to repair the roof. Consequently, the next term, the holes in the ceiling reappeared, as did the buckets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has been rectified, but money was wasted repairing the ceilings. It concerns me that schools in Cardiff were taking a disproportionate share of the repair budget and making it impossible for South Glamorgan to repair the roof at Cowbridge school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as the Secretary of State said in his recent speech, that there is a need for extra resourcing for schools with special problems, difficult catchment areas and so on. However, schools that are doing an excellent job should not be demoralised by being deprived of funds. They deserve a fairer crack of the whip. I would be grateful if the Minister would address that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent 15 years of my career in three different types of schools and in two colleges. Formal teaching, as the Secretary of State knows, is carried out in schools and colleges within a framework of curriculum content, teaching methods and teaching materials. Within that institutional framework, interaction occurs between teacher and pupil, and between lecturer and student.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on the development of attitudes and beliefs during the formative years. My objective is to counteract the rising cynicism that is becoming rampant in our communities. The Government's formula for raising educational standards is no different from their policy for any other part of the public service. The market is to reign supreme. The present Secretary of State is probably a firmer proponent of the beauty of the free market than either of his immediate predecessors. The fulcrum of the free market is uncertainty; its product, fear; and its day-to-day expression, cyncism and a feeling of personal inadequacy. Its long-term effects will be measured by stress-related illness and disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of a dynamic, vibrant teaching profession engendering a thirst for knowledge in the young, we have a Government who create a market setting in which the cash follows the pupil and the teacher must become a better sales specialist—a superior window dresser—to his professional colleagues in neighbouring schools. The head teacher and governing body must plan raids outside their historic catchment areas to tempt pupils with free bus rides to their schools and preferred placement. Pressure mounts to substitute cheap, young and inexperienced teachers for those who are more expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have the opting-out experiment. On 7 July 1993, when the Welsh Select Committee met to consider public expenditure on education in Wales, I asked the Minister of State whether he thought it fair
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
that, in the technology initiative that he inaugurated for secondary schools in Wales, the 220 non-grant-maintained local authority schools had to bid for £1.9 million, whereas six grant-maintained schools bid for £250,000. Those figures demonstrated to me the unfairness in the system under which the Government try to tempt schools into opting out, as they have tried to do with general practitioner fundholders. When the process reaches a certain stage, the money is cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As further education colleges are incorporated with new contracts, the funding council cracks its financial whip to force unwilling lecturers to come to heel by threatening a 2 per cent. retention of money if they do not. Under the insidious confidentiality clause in their contract, lecturers must sign away their right openly to discuss internal matters. No doubt commercial confidentiality will soon be presented as the rationale for secrecy within our educational institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my remarks I made it clear that my greatest preoccupation is how to promote and improve quality in a free state education system. That should be common ground between us. Is the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. I am saying that it is extremely unfair that schools in relatively deprived areas have their best pupils poached by other schools that bus pupils in to undermine the structure of those communities. That is basically unfair, but that is how the Government system is meant to work and I condemn that.

Professor Karl Raimund Popper is one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century. As a student at the London School of Economics, I was privileged to attend his lectures. One of his recurrent themes was that science advances by attacking existing hypotheses, theories and laws. Our society is in serious danger of being dominated by young people ill-prepared to question conventional wisdom and steeped in cynicism, fear and powerlessness—which is the very antithesis of a scientific culture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is going to quote Professor Popper, surely the market model that he has just described is much more akin to Popper's open society than the closed model of control by local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come on to Professor Popper's great friend and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman anticipated what I was about to say by mind reading. Professor Popper was keen on the development of the free market based on certain simple assumptions. The first and most important was that there is a level playing field to start with, with an income and distribution system such that we all begin from the same starting blocks. I do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
anticipate that development resulting from the recent tax changes. I shall not develop that argument or go down that path. Professor Popper's great friend Professor Jacob Bronowski in his book, "The Ascent of Man"—on page 45 for those who are interested in checking the reference. Professor Bronowski said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must be a democracy of the intellect. We must not perish by the distance between people and government; between people and power, by which Babylon and Egypt and Rome failed."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what the constituents of the Secretary of State tell him in Wokingham, but in Wales, we would do well to heed Professor Bronowski's words. The free market will not produce an intellectual democracy. Instead, the big word in this country is "networking", which will become the way to buck the market. If we are not careful, the rise of the meritocracy will have been successfully halted by the Government. We must deal with those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I frequently visit classrooms, as the Minister of State knows. We shared a calculator in the Select Committee and discovered that neither of us could work out the standard spending assessments for seven-year-olds. Given the right hon. Gentleman's superior education compared with mine, there must be a lesson to be learnt. We must unite across party political lines. We must not divide, but realise that in our society is deep cynicism and the demoralisation of what we want to achieve. Unless we apply ourselves to the matter, that cynicism will increase, our economic growth rate will suffer and we shall fall further behind other countries. We should be proud of our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon.

He came out with the wonderful line, "I should not be so pessimistic as the Secretary of State." I think that the hon. Gentleman should be awarded a C minus for the standard of his English.

Constituents of Clwyd, North West are well served by the Government's education policy. They are sensible people; they vote Conservative and they vote for grant-maintained schools, too. My constituency has four grant-maintained schools: Eirias high school, ysgol Emrys ap Iwan and ysgol Bryn Elian—all secondary schools—and a primary school, ysgol Pen-y-Bryn. Two of the secondary schools, ysgol Eirias and ysgol Emrys ap Iwan appear in the "The Good Schools Guide." Only 14 Welsh schools, out of some 300 schools in the United Kingdom, are in that guide, two of which are in my constituency and are grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote what "The Good Schools Guide" says about Eirias high school and ysgol Emrys ap Iwan under the heading of the "Bottom Line." It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Eirias consistently produces the value-added element for its balanced comprehensive intake."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
For ysgol Emrys ap Iwan, the guide states that the school has
	<br><blockquote><p>"achieved fame within and beyond Wales for its innovative and extensive curriculum. Now wants resources to concentrate on its fabric and fundamentals."</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that both schools were doing an equally good job before becoming grant maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Members of the Labour party have said, it is a little early to judge grant-maintained schools because they have had that status for only a couple of years. Of course, they were doing well before, but they are doing even better now. If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I want to comment on other secondary schools in my constituency. Someone mentioned Rhyl—it has excellent schools, such as the Blessed Edward Jones Roman Catholic school and the ysgol Glan Clwyd. There are also two excellent private schools in my constituency. Rydal is one of them. I understand that the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) is a former pupil. Unfortunately, he is not in the Committee at present. Penrhos college for ladies is another. Added to that is an excellent college of further education—Llandrillo yn Rhos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned resources earlier and draw the attention of my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State to applications for capital grants that have been made by the four grant-maintained schools in my constituency. My right hon. Friend has already announced that about £3 million will be allocated to ysgol Emrys ab Iwan in Abergele for its capital programme, but it must reapply this year for the first tranche of that money. I very much hope that my right hon. Friend will see fit to keep his promise to that school. It has been the flagship of the grant-maintained system in north Wales. It fought a bitter battle with the local education authority some years ago when it first applied to become a grant-maintained school. The Labour party campaigned against grant-maintained status and the battle was so bitter that even the then director of education was knocking on doors urging people to vote against the proposal. Fortunately, for Bruce Pyart, the head teacher, the staff, governors, pupils and parents, the school's second attempt to become grant maintained was successful. My right hon. Friend and I visited the school recently and I am sure that he would confirm that it is a worthy school and deserves to receive a capital grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other schools in my constituency are in Colwyn Bay. Their case for capital grants is compelling, partly because of the growth in population in that area. The primary feeder schools are already bursting at the seams because Colwyn Bay has become a very popular place. Housing estates are developing and consequently far more children are attending the schools. The two excellent schools have applied to my right hon. Friend for capital grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
One of the schools, ysgol Bryn Elian, has plenty of room for expansion and could take more pupils. Given the increasing population in Colwyn Bay, the case for ysgol Bryn Elian is compelling, especially as it would put more emphasis on technology than other schools have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On technology, one of my concerns about pupils in Wales is that, when they go to university, they do not consider getting qualifications in industry, commerce or technology. Especially in Welsh speaking schools, there is a tendency for pupils leaving school to recycle the language by becoming teachers or going into the media, rather than by pursuing careers in commerce, industry and technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the important subject of technology, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that, compared with the Curriculum Council for Wales, the recommendations of the Dearing report in England offer a different vision of technology in future. Which does the hon. Gentleman believe would be better?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of what the hon. Gentleman describes. There is concern in some schools in Wales that the correct emphasis may not be placed on technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. Friend by saying that of course there is a difference between the recommendations of the Dearing committee for England, and the Curriculum Council for Wales, with respect to technology and a modern foreign language. Short courses in technology are recommended for England. That does not mean that we cannot teach technology to 14 to 16-year-olds in Welsh schools. Indeed, schools are positively encouraged to do so, but they do not necessarily have to use the short technology course, as in England. There are other ways of achieving the same, and possibly a better, result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for clarifying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem that the Government now recognise, although they have not yet admitted it, is that introducing technology into schools and giving it an important role in the national curriculum cannot be done across the entire curriculum and across all schools unless there are staff knowledgeable in that subject and equipped to teach it. That requires massive extra investment because, for various historic reasons, technology was undertaught in our schools for a very long time. It cannot simply be written into the curriculum without the necessary resources being provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister of State has followed the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must press on, as many other hon. Members wish to speak. The second school in Colwyn Bay which, again, is an excellent school is ysgol Eirias. The head
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
teacher recently invited my right hon. Friend to visit the school and if my right hon. Friend can find the time, it would be well worth it for him to visit the school and see what an excellent, well-run school it is. It has applied to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for a capital grant of £3 million, for three priorities that it has identified. It needs more laboratories. The school has been neglected by the local education authority, which is run by the Labour party and which has diverted resources away from the western side of the county to the eastern side. I urge my right hon. Friend at least to allocate resources for the first priority for which the school has applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth school is the primary school that I mentioned earlier, ysgol Pen-y-Bryn, a feeder school to ysgol Eirias. I understand that it has made an application for £500,000 and I urge my right hon. Friend to approve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools in my constituency are deserving of recognition because they have taken advantage of the opportunity that the Government presented to them. They must not be let down because they are the champions of the Government's education policy, which the Labour party continues to do its utmost to undermine. Its most recent cynical, disgraceful policy announcement was the statement that if it ever formed a Government it would take those grant-maintained schools back into local education authority control. For the Labour party to create uncertainty in those schools to gain political advantage and to use their pupils as political pawns is an absolute disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should point out that time is running out and interventions are taking up time when other hon. Members wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Hughes. Recently, I met five members of the association representing heads of grant-maintained schools in England. They all agreed that under the local management of schools they would have independence similar to that which they have under grant-maintained status. Therefore, there should be no fears about the ability of a school to run itself under Labour's programme to do away with the funding council and unfair funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the cynical exploitation of pupils and their parents by the Labour party suggesting that at some time in future—I hope that it will be the far-distant future—they could no longer be certain of the sort of education that is now provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept your point about time running out, Mr. Hughes, but I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the college of further education in Llandrillo in my constituency. My right hon. Friend has announced that about £6 million will be allocated to that college
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
for its capital programme. The college is an excellent example of the results of years of neglect by the Labour party. The portacabins on the site of the college are so old that they are rotting and the best thing that the Government have done for the students and their parents is to take the college out of the control of Labour-run Clwyd education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to prefabricated portacabins in schools, but they are a problem in all schools because of the variations in populations. For example, each time that we approach the Welsh Office about Dinas junior school in the Rhondda and say that we need extra resources because its roof is falling in, the Welsh Office says no. The local authorities do not have the resources to repair schools or get rid of those portacabins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The record of education authorities on spending on school buildings in recent years is an absolute disgrace. Collectively, they have underspent by about £33 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents have benefited enormously from the Government's education policy. The opportunities presented by the Government have been accepted and I hope that those schools that are not grant maintained will opt for that status, despite the way in which the local Labour party has cynically campaigned against schools that have. I trust that those other schools will grasp the nettle and follow the route to grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen a number of publications dealing with education in Wales. A document entitled "People and Prosperity" was published, I believe, in November and deals specifically with the relationship between training and enterprise. The Secretary of State made a speech in January, which was not particularly welcomed. More important than either of those was a report, emanating not from the Government but from an organisation of what might be called Welsh civil society, the Institute of Welsh Affairs, "Towards an Education Policy for Wales". The documents were concerned with the need to raise standards and to create an education system, which would equip Wales to respond to the rapidly changing circumstances of the modern world and of which we in Wales could be proud. The Institute of Welsh Affairs document considers how a distinctive Welsh education system and perspective can be created, and that is where, naturally enough, I shall concentrate my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education looms large in the history of modern Wales and in the self-perception of the Welsh as a highly educated people. We are all familiar with the myth—I do not use that word in any disparaging sense—of the self-educated Welshman, for he is usually a man in the popular myth. But while recognising the substance contained in that myth, we need to be careful. We need to differentiate between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
myth and objective reality, and to recognise honestly that educational success in Wales has in the past been seen very much as an escape route, both from a humble background and from Wales itself. That has had a debilitating effect, in many ways, on life in Wales and has produced as is recognised in academic studies, a system which has over-emphasised academically able students—those capable of taking the escape route—at the expense of less able students, for whom the education system was often seen as less relevant or barely relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the need to differentiate between myth and reality, we need to avoid complacency. It is one thing to be annoyed by unjust criticisms, but we must not thereby fail to recognise the need constantly to improve standards. That is especially true of special education, an area in which people's aspirations are now greater than they were in the past and where people feel that they have a right to improved provision. That expectation is not being met. Many hon. Members will know about the decision of Dyfed education authority last week to cut its budget by £800,000, which will affect its provision for special educational needs, as a result of the 2.5 per cent. increase in teachers' salaries. That is a tragedy, at a time—even now—when it is difficult for education authorities to satisfy demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one should be satisfied with the fact that Wales is performing less well educationally than it ought to and less well, on average, than England, which in turn is performing less well than many continental countries or Scotland, where educational standards, as measured by examination results and entry into higher education, seem better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Northern Ireland too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Average results can of course be misleading. They conceal enormous variations within Wales, not only between schools but between areas. Dyfed, for example, outperforms the average in England and Wales. There is also one sector in Welsh education that is remarkably successful and that is Welsh-medium schools. They perform extremely well in comparison. These examples show how well we do in Wales with a special and distinctively Welsh approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to criticise, but would the hon. Gentleman not concede that the mix of pupils in Welsh medium schools, particularly in cities such as Cradiff, is drawn mainly from the middle classes, which generally lead to there being higher educational standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear from a Conservative Member the recognition that the social class and background of pupils can affect a school's results. That may be true of the city of Cardiff, but it is not true of other areas such as Rhydfelen, where the school has a similar social composition to other
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
comprehensive schools in the area; nor is it true of Cwmrhymni, where my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) sends his daughter. That special success should be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be altogether satisfied with the situation in Wales, but what do we do about it? How can we move the agenda ahead? How can we achieve higher standards of education in Wales—the sort of education system needed in the modern world? I refer to the report of the Institute of Welsh Affairs, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen. I also refer to the essay by Professor David Reynolds, in which he approves of the initiatives in the early 1980s to enhance standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Professor David Reynolds that the hon. Gentleman speaks of the same David Reynolds that advised Plaid Cymru and Lord Elis-Thomas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that he worked closely with Dafydd Elis Thomas, who now has another title—a title that I never use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
David Reynolds is professor of education at Newcastle. He spoke of the initiatives in the early 1980s to deal with the deficiencies of some schools. He said that those initiatives were then overtaken by the massive reforms devised by the Government—an ideologically-driven Government who derived their mandate from outside Wales and who were not capable and did not wish to come to terms with the special needs of the Welsh education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the elements of those reforms. First, they encouraged competition between schools; it was even said that those schools that could not meet the competition might close because they could not achieve satisfactory standards and thus would not attract pupils. At best, that is irrelevant to Wales, where at least 40 per cent. of pupils are not able to choose a school because of geographical considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the assisted places scheme was irrelevant in Wales, where only 2.5 per cent. of pupils receive private education. It is an insignificant component in the Welsh education system; in England, it is 8.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I flag up the fact that about 700 children in Wales are helped through the assisted places scheme? They are assisted only because their parents have comparatively low incomes. The number of those who are assisted is the equivalent of a fairly substantial secondary school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact remains that the private sector is an insignifcant component in the Welsh education system. That initiative is not the way to tackle the need for improved standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Education Act 1993, grant-maintained schools were allowed to change their character and to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
specialise. That was an attempt to recreate grammar and technical schools and to move towards a restoration of the tripartite system. That is entirely irrelevant in Wales where comprehensive education was pioneered. The areas in which it was pioneered are performing well. Comprehensive education provides the only relevant model for the future. The Government's proposals are contrary to the egalitarian values that we in Wales hold dear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to create two state school systems and funding mechanisms—one through the LEAs and one through the funding council. It is a deliberate attempt to destabilise local government and the LEA sector in Wales. The delivery of services to schools is becoming increasingly problematic and difficult. It is already happening in my county of Dyfed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The curriculum fails to take account of the fact that in Wales there is one extra subject—Welsh, which takes up 10 per cent. of teaching time. That failure has continued under the Ron Deering proposals. Those are all serious weaknesses. Nevertheless, it would be churlish not to recognise that in Wales there are certain distinctively Welsh elements in the education system. They have developed in the nooks and crannies of the reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur strongly with the recommendations in the report of the Institute of Welsh Affairs. It recommends that we should create a distinctive Welsh education system. It makes a series of proposals. At the end of the document, there is a list of 10 recommendations, which members of the Committee and the Government should consider carefully. In Wales, there is already the organisational structure to make it possible for many of the recommendations to be put in place. The big question for the Goverment and for the Committee is whether to create a Welsh education system sooner or later. The time will come when a Welsh Parliament—there is no doubt about that—will create an appropriate education system for Wales. The question is whether the Government wish to start the process using the existing structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report calls for a special conference to be held in Wales this Spring. It will be a Welsh educational convention to discuss the creation of a Welsh education system. I recommended the idea to the Committee and I ask Committee members to push for such a convention and to attend it if it is held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

blaming the local education authorities. For example, West Glamorgan has had millions of pounds stripped from its education budget by the Government in the past few years. As a result, its scope for giving discretionary grants has been narrowed down almost to nil. There are many students who wish to undertake law degrees or music diplomas and many other further or higher education courses for which they do not receive a statutory grant and who are being denied the opportunity to undertake those studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I insist that the Government deal with that gaping whole in the financing of education. It cannot be explained away by passing the buck to local education authorities that are starved of resources. I remind the Secretary of State of a case that I brought to his attention a few weeks ago. It concerns Lucy Richards, a 17-year-old student from Neath who is undertaking A-levels in dance and the performing arts at Gorseinon College. She has been given a tremendous opportunity—against stiff international competition—to undertake a three-year dance performing course at the London Studio Centre. It is a great opportunity for her and a great accolade for her teachers and one that she ought to be able to take advantage of. She has been denied it because West Glamorgan county cannot give her a discretionary grant. That is tragic for her. She is one of the best dance and performing arts students in the whole of West Glamorgan—and, I venture to suggest in the whole of Wales or even Britain—but she will not get that opportunity. The Secretary of State or the Minister must respond to her case and the many others with which my hon. Friends and other Hon. Members are involved. Discretionary awards are vital and must be ring fenced. They should be specifically funded by the Welsh Office, to give our young people the advantage of further and higher education. That is not simply for their personal development; we cannot succeed as an economy or society in Wales unless we are prepared to invest in education. There is no prospect of us fighting competition from abroad unless we have a highly-skilled, high quality education system and economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the distinction between discretionary and mandatory grants. Mandatory grants are automatically paid by Government, whereas discretionary grants are entirely at the discretion of the local authority. Every student must make his or her case and persuade the local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister insults students such as Lucy Richards with that fatuous response. He and his colleagues in the Government have denied education authorities such as West Glamorgan the resources to invest in discretionary awards, which they desperately wish to do to give opportunities to young people. The Minister of State should produce extra resources from the Government's coffers to support such students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another quirk of the system is denying many students in my constituency and across Wales the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
opportunity that they deserve and that our society needs them to have. When students reach the age of 19, their parents are unable to retain income support or child benefit on their behalf. There are people in my constituency on invalidity benefit or income support whose family income is being cut by up to £44 a week when their youngsters reach the age of 19. That is such a tremendous drain on the families' resources that students have to abandon their courses and go on the dole to make up the gap in the family income. That is a tragedy for them, an anomaly in the benefit system and another example of the Government oppressing our young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have all come across cases of 19-year-olds who fall between two stools. Child benefit is withdrawn and no other assistance is available. That happens mainly to those in technical further education—the very sort of education that I thought that the Government wanted to promote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point extremely well. I hope that in his response the Minister will deal with the question of discretionary awards and promise to address the anomalies in the benefit system that are condemning so many people to wasted lives when they could be taking advantage of higher and further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Montgomeryshire we are fortunate to have an extremely capable and dedicated teaching profession and some good schools. The schools are good sometimes because of and sometimes despite Government policy. All teachers in Montgomeryshire would agree that they are fed up with education being treated as a political football. Whether or not that feeling is justified, it exists. All parties involved in local government in Wales—and the Government—should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make some practical and constructive comments on specific issues. If the Minister of State cannot deal with all the matters in what will have to be a brief reply to the debate, I should be grateful if he would write to me later, as teachers and parents in my constituency are concerned about them. The first relates to the sketchy provision of pre-school education facilities. There has been almost no strategy for such facilities for Wales. I pay tribute to the Pre-School Playgroups Association and ysgolion meithrin for their success in voluntarily providing pre-school facilities. It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister say recently that he was determined to increase pre-school education. I look forward to there being a coherent strategy for Wales. I hope, too, that the kids' clubs initiative, which is beginning to do a lot even in rural Wales to help children after school while their parents are still working, will continue to gather momentum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the administrative burden on primary school head teachers.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Unfortunately, good teachers often make bad managers. Primary school heads who wish to maintain their teaching loan find it extremely difficult to cope with the secretarial and administrative functions that new requirements have placed on them. Will the Secretary of State consider providing specific funding to help train head teachers to deal with those administrative burdens more efficiently and to ensure that local education authorities can provide the secretarial services that are needed? Teachers say that those administrative requirements cause them far more stress than teaching pupils, which is the first function of a good head teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I refer to music and art, the teaching of which in rural Wales has faced a significant change. Wales is fortunately far from being a philistine country, but there is a danger of galloping Philistinism if music and art teaching is not widely available to pupils. I recently received a letter from a group of parents in my constituency saying that, because the village primary school can no longer provide music teaching, it is now being contracted from the commercial sector. That has worked for a time, but the commercial cost of obtaining it is driving some pupils out of music learning. Brilliant musicians will usually find their way to the top in any event, but for most of us amateur musicians, the pleasure that we derive from music starts, perhaps only through singing, at school. I hope that that sort of provision and the possibility of learning something about the visual arts can be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I refer to school governors, who are mostly earnest and willing, but very inexperienced. They have a difficult management function and some training is being provided, which is helpful but insufficient. School governors now face the problem of having to choose between different types of staff and they do not have the basic knowledge to do that. Some must choose between teaching and administrative staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a high school in my constituency, a deputy head was replaced by someone who looks after the books. He fulfils a useful function, but I am nor sure that it is the right priority to replace good teachers with good administrators. Some governors tell me that they have to choose between experienced and inexperienced applicants for appointments. They are choosing the inexperienced ones because their salaries are lower. That is not the right criterion for choosing teachers. Of course, some of the inexperienced applicants will immediately leap forward at their interview as being the right people to appoint, but governors should be able to make such appointments on merit alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Primary heads are worried because problems are dealt with by local education authorities. Let us consider the possible abuse of a child by a step-parent. To a head teacher who is not experienced with dealing with specific types of difficulty, the time burden which such a problem can have is enormous and disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Teachers find that small problems can become big problems if the advisory facilities are not adequate to deal with them. In recent years, there has been a tremendous rundown in advisory teaching in Powys, in particular. I do not hesitate to say that part of that rundown was undoubtedly justified. Too many advisers were doing too little. However, there is now almost a complete lack of them. We need at least a core of good advisers who can prevent small problems from turning into big problems for head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) referred to discretionary grants. Whatever the Minister of State says, in some local education authorities in Wales, no discretionary grants are given. A policy decision has had to be taken, because there is not the money to give them. It is not because those authorities are irresponsible; it is because they must prioritise and that was a choice that they were forced to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day I was talking to a postgraduate student who is studying for an MSC at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. He said that out of the 32 students on his course only one receives a grant. There is an undoubted need for people to complete postgraduate courses in subjects such as psychiatry, psychology, business studies and management—the last subject will appeal to the Secretary of State. Students from poorer homes are discriminated against. They are unable to become lawyers or accountants because they cannot afford the costs of the course. Will the Government consider how the discretionary grant structure is being administered in Wales and how to make it fairer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.22 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The enduring characteristic of basic values is that they return to the soul to haunt it. The hon. Member for Torfaen is to be congratulated on beginning his speech by marking the Secretary of State's press release. I am delighted that he chose to point out the incorrect usage of the apostrophe. Last year, I asked the Secretary of State for Education in a written parliamentary question at what age the correct use of the apostrophe was required in the national curriculum. I was told that it was at the age of eight. I asked such a question, because I was so angered by the lack of an apostrophe in the Government's "courts charter." If the hon. Member for Torfaen cares to go through a series of Government publications, not to mention some reports, I regret to say, of schools inspectors, with the thoroughness that he displayed about the Secretary of State's press release, I fear that he will discover that his standards and those which he taught are no longer applied universally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tribute to the Welsh passion for high culture was made by the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) when he talked in such glowing terms about the great Professor Popper. There should be cross-party agreement on the promotion of learning and scholarships in Wales for the largest possible number
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
of children. Unhappily, the more base instincts of the political class occasionally get in the way. Examples of the baser instinct—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall listen with great interest to the response from Opposition Members after I have put the following proposition: democratic accountability was used to excuse and justify the scandal, stopped by the Government, of the old type of board of school governors and managers appointed by local authorities. One party got in and often turfed out all the nominees of other parties. That practice took place in reverse, too. It happened throughout the country. It certainly happened in Cardiff in the old days, and I well remember the details of it. Such political-class meddling in education was wholly undesirable. I doubt whether any political party is prepared to go back to that sort of democratic accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The baser instincts of the political class occasionally get in the way when we consider how much control there should be over the professional management of schools. I am genuinely delighted to hear representatives of the Labour party say that they now support the local management of schools—[Hon. Members: "We always have."] We hear what was said from a sedentary position. Some of us have a slightly different recollection, but we should not become involved in a base examination of the record. The important point is that schools should be run by professionals, by the teachers and parents, and less by politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gower issued a challenge in the most classic Welsh rhetoric. He said that the fulcrum of the free market principle was uncertainty—what a wonderful way of putting it—which led to fear, cynicism, feelings of personal inadequacy and, ultimately, to stress-related illnesses. When the hon. Gentleman goes out to buy his morning cup of coffee, he has a choice of shop. Does he feel that degree of stress, let alone that degree of discomfiture? The serious point—made by Professor Popper, who is one of the greatest figures of the 20th century—is that the democracy of the intellect and the rising of free critical ideas depends on a degree of openness and uncertainty. Of course that causes discomfiture from time to time, but it can be grossly overstated. It undermines the fundamental principles of free scholarship to say that everything has to be ruthlessly controlled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I visit schools and colleges, I am worried about the stress levels and about the rise in absences related to illness. That may be directly caused by the extra responsibilities and burdens put upon those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a serious matter and I share his concern. Whether it is caused by the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a fundamental point about standards, about which we should agree. With respect to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Opposition Members want a degree of Tory ideological differentiation, I have always deplored the British amateur vice of bellettrism and the preference of literature over serious thought. The prospect of there being more emphasis on the metaphysical poets Joyce and Eliot is deeply discomforting to me. I want to see a more detailed critical examination of the thoughts of Professor Popper, a much more significant figure who represents the European mind at its best, and a critical examination of how our society should operate and what values we should have. On the question of teaching prose style, we should see less of Joyce and the metaphysical poets and much more of Bunyan and Defoe, and especially the authorised version of the Bible, as they have had more impact on traditional prose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) is back in his place as I hoped that he would be here for my speech. Unfortunately, I may have only 30 seconds left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy for modern educational theorists to put their ideas in a prose style that the hon. Gentleman and I find unattractive. Standards are about teaching reading as early as possible, and about more books, longer hours, tighter discipline, more homework and more examinations. The teaching profession's enthusiasm for project work is admirable, but it is unfair on children who do not have the support of their parents. It induces a middle-class bias in education, which is fundamentally wrong. Examinations should be marked anonymously and should be an objective test of the pupil's work. The Secretary of State is to be congratulated on taking up the issue of standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in the strange position of winding up for the Labour party from the Front Bench for the first time, and I am proud to undertake that task. When I woke up this morning I felt slightly nervous about the prospect of addressing the Committee, but having heard the speech of the Secretary of State, I feel more confident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I declare an interest? I have three children who attend state schools in Wales. The future of good standards in Wales is the future of my children's education, the future of the children of my hon. Friends who represent constituencies in Wales and the future of our constituents' children. The subject of the debate is close to my heart, because my children are embarking on an education process which they will go through, sadly, under a Conservative Government for the near future but, I hope, under a Labour Government in the future, who will give them the opportunity, equality and fairness that this Government do not offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has highlighted the differences between the two sides of the Committee about good standards in education. The speech that encapsulated my views and those of my party was that of my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Member for Gower, who painted a picture of competition, lack of opportunity, poor resources and picking the cheapest option, rather than the high quality option for people in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has been playing to a different constituency from those that my right hon. and hon. Friends and I represent. That constituency is the constituency of prejudice. What was said today was not about quality education for all, but about restrictions on education for the majority of the people in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recollect that the Secretary of State made an adverse comparison with a school, Dyneror, in my constituency? The Secretary of State seems unaware that it is not a typical school. There is a large ethnic element in the school population, and many of those children must overcome linguistic problems before they overcome academic problems. The Secretary of State looks at statistics, but does not always understand the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has made a valuable point. Statistics and tests have shown that the circumstances of schools are not taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In addition to the problems that that school faces, one must take account of Government policy, which is to cut Home Office section 11 funding designed to help children and their familes whose first language is not English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend adds weight to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he is entirely happy with all the results and achievements of schools in Wales, or does the Labour party believe that some should be better?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State will bear with me, of course I shall make it clear that I am not entirely happy with the performance and achievements of schools in Wales. The Labour councils that are running schools are doing so under tremendous pressure from central Government, under conditions of massive underfunding and in a situation that does not allow them to achieve their full potential. Children in Wales are no less qualified than others to achieve great things. What they need is support, motivation and finance. The debate has shown that the Conservatives' good standards mean prejudice, opportunities denied to our children, as my hon. Friend the Member for Neath and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery have pointed out, and an unfair sharing of resources in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the Labour Government were perfect. I take the point of the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) about the performance of the Labour Government. We are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
happy with what happened. The Conservative Government's performance during the past 15 years has compounded the inequalities that arose under the Labour Government. The Government's performance will continue to compound deficiencies and add to existing stress. We want quality education. I would like education to be judged with a number of benchmarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a learning society—education is not just about tests and exam results. Do schools empower people? Do they help people to achieve? Do schools teach skills and values? Do schools make people a part of society? Are schools open? Do all people have access to schools, irrespective of their position in society? Do we provide quality education which, as the Secretary of State said, gives rise to high motivation and high levels of achievement? Do we provide the resources to do that? Is education continuous? Do people have the opportunity to return to education throughout their lives, not just at school level but at the level mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Neath?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my constituents are redundant steelworkers and miners. They want to go into education, not to pass exams but to make themselves better contributors to society. Is education accountable? Opt-out procedures mean that education will continue to move towards unaccountability. Is education a partnership between schools and the community, business, parents and church? Those are the aspirations of my party, and, despite what the hon. Member for Clwyd, Northwest said, they were the aspirations of my party in the 1970s. We may not have achieved all that we wanted to achieve, but we tried. Our policies provide the best hope for future opportunities for children in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Government are damaging those aspirations. Recently, in Rhondda the Secretary of State said—to what must have been a full house, because we know that the Conservative party has enormous influence there—that governors and head teachers should stop blaming the lack of money for poor exam results. That is a phrase to juggle with. Will the Secretary of State come with me to Clwyd, where last year's rate support grant cut was £12 million and where this year's rate support grant cut is £11 million? The 	<i>Daily Post,</i> my local newspaper, reported on Monday that, because of the education department's share of that rate support grant cut
	<br><blockquote><p>"About 200 teaching jobs are at risk once more as a county's education department struggles to balance its books."</p></blockquote>
Will the Secretary of State come with me to Gwynedd, where the same education argument goes on? On 22 February 1994, the 	<i>Daily Post</i> reported that teachers in Gwynedd are protesting that schools in the county are now facing budget cuts of up to £25,000 in each school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should read Her Majesty's inspectorate report. It states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"deficiencies such as leaking roofs, rotting window frames, poor storage of and access to resources, inadequate laboratories, broken perimeter fencing, unsatisfactory demountable classrooms, are recorded in 70 per cent. of … primary schools and 70 per cent. of … secondary schools."</p></blockquote>
Motivation alone will not solve those problems. Leadership will not solve the problem of Dyfed's 2.9 per cent. pay award for teachers, which has meant a cut in educational standards. Proper funding levels and a proper approach to funding are needed to ensure that the county councils that have the highest aspirations for our children have the resources to fulfil them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, brought in from the planet Wokingham, may not notice these cuts, but if he does not understand that the, lack of resources attacks the quality and standards of education, he does not recognise the principal reason why children in Wales fail to achieve the standards that they should achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money is there and the Government could choose to provide it. I could wax lyrical for the next 45 minutes about the tax cuts awarded to the wealthy in the past 15 years, but they have not led to investment in schools. Some of the issues that I wish to discuss have important financial implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman researched the statistics that I mentioned in an earlier intervention? Although there have been cuts in tax rates, the amount of tax raised by the rich, which pays for education in Wales among other things, has increased in monetary terms. Is not that a good thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather concentrate on the £5 million given to a handful of opted-out schools in Wales. The education authorities in the constituencies of Opposition Members could use that money more productively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer now to the £2.5 million spent on assisted places schemes which has increased from £160,000 last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seven hundred pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State says that it affects 700 pupils. We do not intend to limit their education opportunities, but to increase them by allocating money to ensure that the best education is made available to all our children and not to a few selected children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What purpose do the opted-out schools serve? Why are valuable resources being pumped into them when we need to concentrate on mainstream education? I warn the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West that the next Labour Government will ensure that schools cease to opt out and we shall review the financial commitments to those schools that have opted out. We recognise that such schools create the sort of society that my hon. Friend the Member for Gower described as divisive, competitive and opposed to all that we want to achieve.

The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and my Friend the M6mber for Neath asked what would happen after education in schools. Discretionary awards are being chopped and opportunities denied. Student loans are denying opportunities to people such as myself, who could never have attended university under a Labour Government if they had ruled that loans were the only means of finance available. Cuts in student grants are denying opportunities to people throughout Wales who cannot undertake courses because of the Government's policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clwyd, Northwest should allow me to take him to Flint in my constituency where I hold a surgery every Saturday. I could show him people whose opportunities in life will be denied because of cuts in discretionary awards and who cannot attend university because they cannot afford to take out student loans. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want us to build on what is good. Labour authorities in Wales provide nursery education for almost all children, but they could do even better with Government support. We need to expand nursery provision and ensure that opted-out schools are brought back under education authority control and that there is adequate funding for the schools in our communities. We must also ensure that we provide opportunities through secondary and further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have failed to recognise not only that education is for life, but that it affects life. The Government are denying people opportunities to develop their skills and talents and that will cause difficulties for the next generation who will have less motivation to reach their full potential. We seek to enable people to contribute to society by reaching their full potential and that is why a Labour Government will support education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) on what was, for me, his first speech from the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate began with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State paying tribute to the achievements of good schools and good teachers in Wales. We all acknowledge those; we are not worried about the good schools, good teachers or high achievers. We are worried about the poor schools, the—alas—poor teachers and the poor pupils who are not achieving what they should be. That is very important in Wales as the hon. Member for Gower realised. National targets for eduation and training lie ahead of us and it is worth reminding the Committee just how far short we are of achieving those targets. It is important that we in Wales should achieve those targets, because we are in competition with other countries, some of which have already achieved those eduational levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I shall cite just a couple of the targets. By 1997, 80 per cent. of young people must reach national vocational qualification level 2, of five GCSEs. Our achievement in that area last year was 58 per cent., so we have a long way to go. Secondly, by the year 2000, 50 per cent. of young people are to reach NVQ level 3 or two A-levels; in 1993, we achieved 31 per cent. We have a big challenge ahead, as we laid out in "People and Prosperity", which emphasises the central role of education and training in Welsh regeneration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me first make the vitally important point that I, my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been at the Welsh Office since 1979: does he accept any responsibility for the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Now we know how our economy has developed in the subsequent years and, having enjoyed the growth of the 1980s, only now do we fully realise the competition and challenges that lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that we have pursued our analysis of this and I was glad that the hon. Member for Torfaen referred to the chief inspector's review of educational provision in England and Wales for 1992–93. I can only repeat to him that the chief inspector states that work was less than satisfactory in almost 25 per cent. of primary classes and almost 20 per cent. of secondary classes. We therefore surely have a duty to look carefully at the figures and find out the causes for them.

That position is reflected in our GCSE results. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) noted that we should not be satisfied with them. That is true. Although results have significantly improved in recent years, 12 per cent. of children in Wales leave school without qualifications, compared with 5.6 per cent. in England. We have a duty to consider the causes of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Le me deal with causation, and then the hon. Gentleman may have cause to intervene. We believe the underlying cause to be expectations that are too low in the education system in Wales. Under-achievement and under-performance are too readily accepted and condoned. Children settle for the certificate of education when they should be aiming for GCSEs. No fewer than 7 per cent. of our boys and 4 per cent. of our girls choose to try for the certificate of education. Parents and schools condone the absence of pupils who cannot afford to be cut off from education. In a high

proportion of classes, the quality of teaching is not satisfactory. That is our analysis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What specific initiatives has the Welsh Office undertaken in the past 15 years to improve the effective management of schools and the delivery of high-quality teaching in the classroom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given time I would reel off what the Government are doing about that. We do not accept the answer provided by the Institute of Welsh Affairs and Professor Reynolds. We shall not opt to go into a lesser league just because we are not doing particularly well in the present league. There are differences within the system that allow for our uniqueness and we have our own institutions and teaching orders for history, geography, art, music and of course Welsh, which is unique to us. Our children deserve the opportunity to maximise their potential and we owe it to them to set the highest standards in our schools and colleges and to expect those standards to be delivered. That has been the thrust of our policy during the past few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not something deeply ironic in the suggestion that somehow Her Majesty's Ministers have left this problem too much to Welsh local education authorities during the past 15 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I find it curious to hear Opposition Members endorsing the policy of local management of schools. The main purpose of that policy was to ensure that an ever-increasing proportion of the budget for schools is devolved to schools. I have already referred to the fact that there has been progress, because 66 per cent. of the budget for schools was devolved to schools three years ago. That proportion has now increased slightly to 71 per cent. It surprises me that Opposition Members do not endorse the next logical step, which is to give schools all the money, as happens if they opt for grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that when schools go for grant-maintained status, they will not get 100 per cent. of the money. The funding council will retain money—we have no idea what proportion of the total education budget—for what it calls special purpose grants. Schools will get no more of the funding under grant-maintained status than they do under local education authority status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. I can assure him that a schools funding council for Wales will be concerned only with funding. It will not perform all the functions that local education authorities arrogate to themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want simply to put it on record that the Labour party is opposed to grant-maintained schools but not to the local management of schools, which a Labour Government will retain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite clear about that, but I cannot understand why the Labour party fails to take the logical next step and give 100 per cent. of funding to the individual schools.

We have taken much action to deliver the high standards to which I have referred. We have a good record on nursery education in Wales: 70 per cent. of our under-fives receive education. We are improving teacher training: new criteria are being adopted for courses and there is a bigger role for schools and a greater diversity of routes into training.

We have accepted the recommendations of the Curriculum Council for Wales to slim down the mandatory curriculum for five to 14-year-olds and to simplify and improve the method of measuring pupils' attainment and progress. Teachers and pupils now have more freedom and flexibility. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West is moaning and groaning about the recommended change, which was accepted by my right hon. Friend, concerning Welsh as a second language. That is rich, considering that the Labour party's only commitment to the Welsh language in its manifesto was to say that the study of Welsh would be included in schools teaching in the medium of Welsh. There was no reference to Welsh as a second language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has totally and unjustifiably misinterpreted what I was chuntering on about—as he put it. I was saying that the Government, unfortunately, had had to recognise that the national curriculum, as the Labour party had pointed out on Second Reading of the Bill that set it up, should not be over-prescriptive and had to allow some flexibility for teachers. Two years later, the Government, under pressure from Sir Ron Dearing and the committee, acceded to that. We were pleased by the Government's recognition that what Labour Members had said on behalf of the education profession was right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for any necessary clarification. The debate has been dominated by talk about resources. I must remind Opposition Members that total spending for the coming year is about £2.7 billion. That is an increase of 4.2 per cent. on this year. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Opposition Members criticise the Government for failing to give local authorities freedom. Local authorities decide their priorities. They decide how much to spend on education and how much to spend on discretionary grants. That is the meaning of the word "discretion" in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans), who spoke about capital spending, that the history of local authority capital expenditure on schools in Wales is a history of underspending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
