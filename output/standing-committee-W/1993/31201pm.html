Implications of the Budget for Wales</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales.—<i>[Mr. Redwood]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the break, I was talking about the home energy efficiency policy, how it has already helped about half a million households and how it is helping a further 250,000 households this year. The latest additional amount of £35 million announced yesterday by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will effectively widen the scope of that policy, so that all pensioners can avail themselves of assistance under the scheme. That will not only reduce the cost of their heating bills, but will help the environment by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.<br><br>
It annoyed me in the debate over the past few months about VAT on fuel that various Opposition parties rubbished Conservative policy on that issue, despite the fact that it is clearly beneficial to the environment. Furthermore, my right hon. and learned Friend said yesterday that the additional 14p a gallon imposed on fuel will enable us to reach our target for CO<div class='sub'><span class='label label-warning'>sub</span>
2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions, as agreed as the Rio summit. That increase is a cause of concern as my constituency is semi-rural and many of my constituents rely on their vehicles. It will worry also hauliers in my constituency. However, we must face up to the fact that if we do nothing about the current level of emissions while we can, we shall poison the planet for our descendents.<br><br>
The price of fuel will continue to rise, which will provide a deterrent to its use and contribute to a healthier environment. I ask road hauliers in my constituency and elsewhere in Wales to note that yesterday's Budget was calculated to assist the recovery, which will help the haulage industry as it will the rest of industry.<br><br>
As to VAT on newspapers, books, children's clothing, travel and food, the Committee will remember how skilfully my right hon. and learned Friend announced yesterday that there are arguments to recommend the imposition on VAT on all those items, but then said that he had no plans to do so. My right hon. and hon. Friends will remember the delight on the faces of Opposition Members turning to gloom, because the one issue that really delights Opposition Members is a policy that is bad for the electorate.<br><br>
The reduction in mortgage tax relief from 20 per cent. to 15 per cent. will involve an extra £10 per month on a £30,000 loan. Let us balance that against the reduction in the average mortgage of £170 caused by lower interest.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting issue. He is a solicitor and, in recent years, he will have advised many people about mortgages. When interest rates were higher, many—in fact most—solicitors advised their clients to take out mortgages at a fixed interest rate. It follows that many people have not enjoyed a reduction in their mortgage repayments for a considerable time. The equation that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make is therefore a little misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is right that many borrowers opted for fixed-interest mortgages. Such mortgages have only recently been generally available. There can be no certainty of what interest rates will be in future—or of what tax relief will be available. People who opt for a fixed interest rate take a gamble, as do those who opt for a fluctuating rate. Some will win and some will lose. The new measure will not deter people from buying houses, nor will it stifle the recovery in the housing market, which is already apparent in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend find some inconsistency in the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks about low interest rates? He bemoans the position of those who opted for a fixed rate, yet his party spent much time in Newbury and at other by-elections complaining that pensioners receive lower interest on their investments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the benefit of his legal expertise, my hon. Friend makes a good point. I should like mortgage tax relief eventually to be removed. I believe that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is making a move in the right direction, at a time when interest rates are comparatively low—so the effect on borrowers will not be severe. Tax relief on mortgages represents an unwarranted interference in the market. It was introduced to promote home ownership, but it now serves only to distort the housing market. It also reduces the amount of money available for investment in business.<br><br>
It was suggested yesterday in the House that VAT should be imposed at the penal rate of 30 per cent. on school fees and private health schemes. That is the politics of envy. Every child who goes to a private school and every patient who is treated privately represents a substantial saving to the Exchequer. Therefore, it would have been tax efficient to give special help to those people. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will remedy that oversight in his next Budget.<br><br>
The new job seekers allowance, which will not start until 1996, will provide an automatic entitlement for six months, based on contributions paid. Thereafter, help will be means tested. Already, two thirds of the unemployed find new jobs within six months. The new scheme will save £473 million per annum. It is a good change, to call it a job seekers allowance—the emphasis should be on getting people back to work. Overall, the package of measures announced yesterday encourages that. We must try to keep the recovery going, so that when the job seekers allowance starts in 1996, few will remain unemployed longer than six months.<br><br>
National insurance contributions were due to increase by 1 per cent. next spring, as announced in the previous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
Budget. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor is rightly giving special help to employers by lowering the rate of employers' contributions on low income earners. That is consistent with the Government's policy in reducing disincentives to employing people. One cannot help contrasting that with the attitude of Opposition Members, who support the social chapter, the minimum wage and other interventionist ideas designed to reduce efficiency in the labour market and to discourage employment.<br><br>
The price of cigarettes will increase 11p per packet of 20. That move was fully justified, not only in terms of revenue production but on health grounds. I hope that the Government will take further measures and that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health will decide to implement a ban of tobacco advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an EC recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not condemn everything that comes from the EC, but I condemn the distortion of the market to pay tobacco growers in the European Community.<br><br>
I am pleased that there is no increase in duty on beer and spirits. Such a policy takes into account the difficulties currently faced by both industries as a result of unfair competition from abroad and in particular from people entering this country with enormous quantities loaded into their car boots, ostensibly for personal consumption—but in reality, I fear, for re-sale.<br><br>
No increase in duty on beer and spirits is good news for Welsh breweries near my constituency. I am sure that the small vineyard in the Vale of Glamorgan will welcome the fact that the rise in duty on bottles of wine is limited to 2p. I recommend that vineyard's wine.<br><br>
We need better controls on the so-called personal allowances of alcohol brought into Britain. Breweries and publicans who lobbied Members of Parliament about reducing duty on their products could encourage me to support them by cutting the cost of soft drinks in then-outlets. There is an obvious correlation between alcohol consumption and drink-driving. I should like to discourage drinking and driving altogether, and one might do that if pubs sold soft drinks at more competitive prices.<br><br>
I shall end on a controversial note, not designed to please the hon. Member for Caerphilly. He took exception to my comment that seats in Wales with the worst economic problems are held by Labour Members. I accept that remark was a little cheap, especially as it was made from a sedentary position. Nevertheless the hon. Gentleman cannot escape the fact that there is such a correlation. Perhaps if mere was a greater spirit of free enterprise, more Conservative Members of Parliament and more Conservative councillors would make more progress with economic recovery. The Vale of Glamorgan has been represented by Conservative Members of Parliament for some 40 years out of the last 43, and has the highest level of inward investment of any constituency in Wales—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been going on for some 20 minutes or so and he is not addressing his remarks to the implications of the Budget to Wales. I ask him to wind up his speech.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hughes. I got carried away because of the remarks of the hon. Member for Caerphilly. I am sure that he will not take it amiss that I responded in kind.<br><br>
I welcome the Budget—it is a first-class Budget for Wales in general and the Vale of Glamorgan in particular.</span></p>
<p>4.14 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make only a short contribution to the debate, as I recognise that other hon. Members want to speak.<br><br>
Several points came to my mind as I sat in the Chamber yesterday listening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer present his Budget. Sadly, none of them were positive for Wales or my constituency. All that we heard today reinforces my belief that the Budget will not achieve for Wales what I want—more justice, more fairness, more employment and an improvement in public services and opportunities for those whom I represent.<br><br>
Everything that the Government proposed in the Budget will have the reverse effect upon Wales and my constituents. How will those of my constituents who aspire to attend university in three years face the future? The present grant for university students outside London is £2,265. In three years, the maximum grant will be £1,652. How is that supposed to provide opportunities for people such as my constituents to go on to be higher tax payers and make their contribution to society? Many of them already find it difficult to get funding for higher education and will be denied opportunities because of the measure.<br><br>
The Government always say when student loans are mentioned that many students will be higher tax payers in the future. Many of my constituents who want to go into higher education want not to become slick City lawyers earning vast salaries—my apologies to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) who, I must say, looks the very epitome of a slick City lawyer, for I was thinking of Conservative Members—or to earn vast salaries in industry, but to come back to Delyn, Clwyd and elsewhere to put back into their local community, very often at low salaries, the skills that they have learnt elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lightbown (Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not below a certain level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ignore the comment of the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown), because he is as relevant to Wales as any other Conservative Member in the Room, which is not very relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was not born in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West says that I was not born in Wales. I happily concede that I was not, but some 25,000 people in Wales voted for me on April 9 last year—which is a hell of a lot more than voted for the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East or for the Secretary of State for Wales.<br><br>
Many of my constituents who were born and bred in Wales, together with those who have made their homes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
in Wales, will be denied the opportunity to enter higher education. People in the poor part of my constituency may have talent and want to enter higher education, but their family background means that they cannot afford to take up student loans, or they do not have a family history of taking on debt and do not want to do so. That is one example of how opportunity will be denied in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of the electorate who voted for the hon. Gentleman and for my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, South-West are all citizens of the United Kingdom, and this is the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is, but I recall that this is the Welsh Grand Committee. On that basis, I suspect that hon. Members who have been elected by people in Wales have more authority than those who have not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. Will you clarify for us, in relation to the remark that the hon. Gentleman just made, whether it is the case that an hon. Member who has been elected to this Committee by the House has less authority than one who has been elected in Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I ask the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) to confine his remarks to the implications of the Budget in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to the question of the Budget's implications for Wales, rather than respond to sedentary interventions from Conservative Members.<br><br>
How does the Budget give equality of opportunity in benefits? What about the 570,000 pensioners who must pay VAT on their fuel bills in exactly the same way as I must pay, despite the Governments crude mechanisms that were announced yesterday? How will equality of opportunity be achieved when we consider the Government's policy on retirement? Rather than grasping the opportunity to set targets to reduce the hours and years that people work, the Government are extending the working lives of women, as opposed to reducing men's working lives to 60 years.<br><br>
What will spending cuts bring? I await with interest to hear where and how public expenditure cuts will affect Wales. We shall not escape such cuts. I know from my surgeries how people are suffering because of local government cuts in Clwyd and Delyn borough councils. The Budget is again about public spending cuts throughout Wales. We are talking not about amorphous bureaucracy, but of people and services, such as home helps, school transport, housing, and so on, that will be affected by the cuts announced in the Budget.<br><br>
I can tell my constituents that the Conservative Government, who came to power again on a promise of tax reductions, have announced four rises in taxes on income. Mortgage tax relief will be cut; personal allowances are frozen; the married couple's allowance will be cut; and national insurance contributions will increase. I can tell my constituents also that there are three more indirect taxes on people's incomes. There will be a tax on home insurance, which people must have; there will be a tax on car insurance and there will be a tax on holidays,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
under the proposals to tax flights. The Budget is not a double whammy, but a triple whammy of cuts in public services; more tax on what we spend; and more income tax.<br><br>
My constituents will not find that attractive. I wish that the Government had not tried to find money by imposing VAT in pensioners' fuel bills or by cutting public spending still further. The Government should have considered those who can afford to pay more indirect taxes, which would have been fairer and more just. If they had raised the higher tax rate from 40 per cent. to 55 per cent., which is well within what the country can afford, there would have been sufficient money to avoid imposing VAT on fuel and other measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems very attractive to advance that proposition and say, "Why not punish the rich?", but by reducing the top tax rates to 40 per cent. we obtain more revenue. There is no challenge to the statistics published by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor two weeks ago, which show that whether we take the top 1 per cent., 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., the money contributed by the higher taxpayers is greater with lower rates. The only justification for increasing top tax rates is to cut off one's nose to spite one's face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I disagree on that. I believe that my party would favour a policy whereby people who are better able to pay do so. Statistics show that if the higher rate of income tax were raised, it could stop VAT being levied on pensioners' fuel bills in Wales. The Budget will be seen in my constituency as a Budget of public spending cuts, higher direct taxes and higher indirect taxes. The Government appear to be proud of their Budget, but neither my constituents nor the majority of those in Wales voted for them in the general election.</span></p>
<p>4.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to emulate, in at least one respect, John Jones Roberts, once a much-loved but now forgotten advocate from Blaenau Ffestiniog, who was known as the fairest lawyer in Wales in his day. During the course of the second world war, because of a shortage of barristers in north Wales, he used to appear on both sides in the same case, always striving to be extremely fair as he stepped from the prosecution to the defence.<br><br>
I shall try to be as fair as I can to the Government about this somewhat extraordinary Budget. I shall not, however, attempt to emulate John Jones Roberts in something else that he knew well, although I believe that the Chancellor did so yesterday. John Jones Roberts knew that if one had a difficult defence in a complicated case in which one wanted to persuade the jury that one's client was not guilty, one should put in a huge amount of detail and as much muddle as possible in the hope that the jurors would not be able to understand the thrust of what one was saying by the time that one had finished. I am afraid that that was the impression that many of us were left with yesterday afternoon.<br><br>
In trying to be fair, at least to begin with, I welcome some of the steps that have been taken to help small businesses. In particular, we should welcome the increase in the VAT threshold, which will help many small
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
businesses in my constituency. We should welcome also the relaxed accountancy requirements, although I suspect that accountants will find another way of charging their clients the same fees. I hope that small businesses will be tough with their accountants and realise that they can always negotiate lower fees. It is a buyers' market.<br><br>
I welcome the statement that, as I understand it, the Government are considering the introduction of legislation to deal with the late payment of debt. There has been much discussion of that subject in recent years, and it would seem that the consultation period could be short in the extreme. I hope that the Government will introduce legislation that will be effective to ensure that those who do not pay their debts to small businesses will have to pay interest. The Government are one of the worst offenders in that regard.<br><br>
To a limited extent, I welcome the introduction of venture capital trusts, although I believe that it is a mistake on the Government's part not to front-load them with tax relief. The business expansion scheme has been a failure in Wales and I do not believe that venture capital trusts or the enterprise investments scheme, also announced yesterday, will be a greater success than the BES in Wales.<br><br>
There is a great need to find venture capital to enable small businesses to grow from an indigenous base in Wales. A great deal of valuable work has been done by the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales, but it has not helped so many small businesses to increase their capital base in a way that would enable them to grow without being bought out or taken over.<br><br>
It is a matter of great concern that the Budget has proved to be fiscally so regressive for the people of Wales. There are some interesting tables in <i>The Times</i> this morning that show that the percentage of extra taxation to be paid will be highest for those who receive the lowest incomes. To put it another way by taking middle and higher income groups, it is extraordinary that someone who earns £30,000 a year, such as, for example, the head of a primary school in rural Wales, will pay as much in extra taxation as the chairman of a recently-privatised industry.<br><br>
The table in <i>The Times</i> suggests that someone earning £180,000 a year will not pay a penny more in additional tax as compared with someone earning £30,000 a year. That cannot be just. At first sight, one might say that £30,000 a year is a great deal of money—even Members of Parliament earn sums close to that. However, many people who play a significant part in Wales earn salaries of that order. I have mentioned primary school heads, and middle-ranking senior police officers would be another example. Those who come within those examples, and many others, will feel a sense of grievance that the taxation system remains so unfair.<br><br>
Earlier in the debate, the hon. Member for Caerphilly mentioned the low unemployment in my constituency of Montgomery. That is true, and it is to be welcomed. I repeat that we owe a debt of gratitude to the work of the Development Board for Rural Wales in bringing employment into the county. For example, I know that the Minister of State earlier this week met Fred Murphy, as did I. Mr. Murphy is the chief executive officer of Fisher Gauge, a high technology Canadian company that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
has opened up an architecturally superb and progressive factory on a new industrial park just outside Welshpool. Such developments are to be welcomed, but they replace neither very low paid jobs, nor those jobs that are being lost in our heavy industry in rural mid-Wales.<br><br>
Our heavy industry is agriculture—the last heavy industry on any large scale left in Wales. In the past day or so, we heard about the Government's proposed swingeing cut in hill livestock compensatory allowances. I have been frankly astonished by the attitude displayed by most—although perhaps not all—Conservative Members in response to that announcement. Anyone who believes that the Conservative party can sit back complacently in the belief that the farmers of mid-Wales are so delighted with cuts in interest rates and other compensating benefits that they will conclude that cuts in HLCAs and the Budget will leave them no worse off is very misguided. Such people had better think again. Those farmers hoped that there would be something in the Budget to demonstrate that the Government recognise the punitive nature of the withdrawal of a quarter of the HLCAs. That was not to be.<br><br>
We hoped that the Government would announce measures in the Budget to provide the male employment that is so badly needed to replace disappearing agricultural jobs in hilly rural Wales. We do not ask for bespoke jobs. Farmers do not expect to be measured up for a nice little job once they are no longer able to run their own businesses—but they do ask that the Welsh Office and the statutory agencies examine the hard, tough, men's jobs that farmers have been doing, to ascertain whether it is possible to introduce more work of that sort into rural mid-Wales. The much-vaunted Fortex proposal seems likely to fail. Our optimism for that project seems to have been misplaced. We had hoped that the Budget would show that the Government were considering that part of the job picture.<br><br>
It is also right to say that when we speak of low unemployment in rural Wales and complain that not enough of the Budget has been targeted at employment schemes, we are overlooking the reality of what is happening in agriculture. On the whole, farmers' wives do not sign on as unemployed, although many believe that for financial reasons they need to have jobs off the farm if at all possible. Week after week, I see farm accounts, and I can tell the Minister that no one needs more help from budgetary measures than those farmers. I see the accounts of the minority of farmers who make high profits. More often, I see the accounts of farmers whose profits amount to a minute percentage—often no more than 20 per cent.—of national average earnings.<br><br>
Part of the Budget was very diffuse and has been described fairly as something of a conjuring trick by the Chancellor. He produced a sort of black hat—dare I say, something like an opera hat?—and into a big black hole in that hat he placed the letters PSBR. Out of the same hat, the Chancellor tried to produce a rabbit—the way in which the PSBR could be cut. But there ain't no rabbit there, unfortunately.<br><br>
If one looks at page 117 of the Red Book and examines the Government's plans to cut public expenditure, one begins, on careful analysis, to see the real effect that they will have on Wales. Perhaps I should preface these remarks by saying that, whatever the Secretary of State says, we all know that in most respects—education,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0242">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
housing and other aspects of its work—the Welsh Office follows the London spending Departments anyway. We start with the extraordinary revelation, near the bottom of the table on page 117, that between 1994 and 1997, £21 billion from the contingency reserves will be used to subsidise public spending. That is not a cut in public spending—the Government are dipping into the deposit account to try to pretend that there is a cut in public spending.<br><br>
In agriculture, there will be a cut between 1993–94 and 1995–96. That will affect Wales. Etraordinarily, the trade and industry budget is to be cut savagely, from £3.6 billion in 1993–94 to £2.27 billion in 1994–95. What will that do to help Welsh industry? Nothing. It will have an extremely damaging effect on Welsh industry, as it will on industry throughout the country.<br><br>
There will be cuts in other Departments. The housing budget of the Department of the Environment is to be cut almost three quarters of a billion pounds between 1992–93 and 1995–96.<br><br>
The Welsh Office will, of course, follow the policies of the Department of the Environment, and we know that we shall see cuts in the budget of Tai Cymru. That has more or less been admitted by the Government. I tell the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary that if they cut Tai Cymru's budget, they will have a massive housing crisis on their hands. Last weekend in my constituency, I was constrained to examine private rents for people who could not obtain public housing. Private rents for small accommodation are now as high in rural Montgomeryshire as they are in London.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman speaks in warm terms about Tai Cymru's work. Bearing in mind what we know about the attitude of members of his party towards consistency, I wonder whether he shares the view of his former colleague, my predecessor in the House, who, at their recent annual conference, described the work of Tai Cymru as "ethnic cleansing".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not speak warmly of Tai Cymru. I said that I was concerned about the cuts in its budget. We would have a much better public housing system if councils were allowed to do the job at which they were extremely good in the past. However, if all public housing is to be built by housing associations, the Budget should allow local considerations to be taken fully into account. We now have standardised designs, contractors and budgets, which do not fit all parts of Wales.<br><br>
We are disappointed that the Budget contains so little to give us any optimism about the transport infrastructure in and through mid-Wales. It is a scandal that one cannot travel by train from north Wales to south Wales, and in reality one cannot travel by road from north Wales to south Wales, unless one is prepared to go the long way around and via England. That situation is not acceptable. The Secretary of State spoke this morning about a meeting with the chairman of British Rail to discuss whether the railways could be marketed better. That is a pretty thin version of what is needed. Of course the railways should be marketed better, but there must be something to market. The way things are going, it looks as though there will be no railway in mid-Wales after privatisation. At present, not one carton of freight is carried on railways in central Wales. That is unacceptable. Other hon. Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
and I receive many complaints about lorries thundering through villages in rural areas. The last straw for us was British Rail's decision to price Shell out of the market by increasing its charges by 50 per cent. No one can blame Shell for refusing to pay the extra 50 per cent. Government policy has led to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said that one cannot travel from north Wales to south Wales by road. However, I travel frequently from north Wales to south Wales by road. I go through his constituency on the A483 and am pleased that a new bypass to Welshpool has now opened there. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman is also pleased about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a little off the point and I shall not be drawn down that track. However, I draw to the hon. Gentleman's attention the large number of accidents on the Welshpool bypass because of bad design.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must confine their remarks to the implications of the Budget for the economy of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The budget for Wales would be more acceptable if it meant that one could travel quickly from north Wales to south Wales without it being more convenient to go through England.<br><br>
In my constituency and in much of coastal north Wales, many pensioners live partly on state pension and partly on savings. The announcement of a pensioners' bond is, on face value, welcome. I understand that it is intended to provide an acceptable and secure rate of interest for pensioners. However, having read the National Savings press release, I am puzzled about why the bond is being postponed until the new year. I suggest that there is a hidden agenda. The Government's press release, issued through the Vote Office after the Chancellor finished his Budget speech yesterday, states that the bond will be launched in the new year and that the rate of interest will be the
<br><blockquote><p>"market interest rates prevailing at the time of launch."</p></blockquote>
The Government are diddling the pensioners of Wales. It is likely that there will be a further cut in interest rates by the end of the year. Therefore, the interest rate payable on the bond will be reduced further.<br><br>
Pensioners will consider the measure as a cosmetic gesture unless the Government make the bond index-linked to ensure that if interest rates increase the interest available from the bond will increase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Also, it is to be marketed at what are likely to be the lowest interest rates for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to make that point. The Government are trying to get away with pretending that they are giving pensioners a great opportunity when they are actually offering a poor bond that, rightly, few pensioners will be advised to take up. Buying at the bottom of the market is an extremely bad idea. I ask the Government to consider carefully that point and to try to ensure that the many pensioners who have a few thousand pounds in savings—which can make a considerable difference to their standard of living—are given a fair
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
opportunity, with a fair bond that will secure a fair rate of return. At the moment, we must be suspicious that that is not the case.<br><br>
This is a depressing Budget for Wales because everybody will pay more taxes and nobody, it appears, will benefit—apart from small businesses, which will benefit in small measure. I wish that the Government would attack the infrastructure problems of Wales with a comprehensive package and a Welsh budget for Wales, rather than with the panoply of a United Kingdom budget that they try to excuse as not too bad for Wales.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In trying to reach a judgment about the impact of the Budget on Wales it is as well to examine the issues and pass over them as briefly as the Chancellor yesterday tried to linger over them.<br><br>
Yes, there will be help for small businesses, but such is the state of the small business economy that the help offered yesterday was akin to the relaxation of the grip around the throat of a man being throttled. There will be relief that some pressure is being taken off, but for men and women in my constituency who run small businesses—some have lost businesses since the last general election and feel betrayed by the Government—the good news has come too late. Those who survive and have been in business for a long time told me that the past year was the worst since the 1950s and that they can see no sign of a firm, well-founded recovery.<br><br>
There has been help for small businesses—let us be grateful for small mercies—but that is not likely to make a major impact on the Welsh economy or make, by this time next year, a substantial dent in unemployment.<br><br>
The one or two concessions made to big businesses were undermined by the fact that responsibility for statutory sick pay has been tossed in those businesses' laps. It is rather unusual that the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan should bemoan the social responsibilities in the social charter while failing to mention the fact that such a social responsibility has been put by the Government on to big business. The hon. Gentleman is looking at me with a certain air of expectation but does not appear to want to comment.<br><br>
It would be a brave Minister who would predict a major or even a significant reduction in unemployment in Wales over the coming year on the basis of the Budget measures alone. As for the impact of the Budget announcements on people in Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney described graphically, eloquently and accurately the way in which people who are already struggling to survive in a reasonable manner will be hit by the measures.<br><br>
If only George Orwell were living, he would have gloried in the job seekers' allowance for those who have been unemployed for more than six months. That is what newspeak is all about. Such is the shamelessness of Conservative Members that they can glory in the allowance as a step towards helping the unemployed. New jobs will help the unemployed, but direct ways of helping them with new jobs are few and far between in the Budget.<br><br>
If the Chancellor's words about the public sector borrowing requirement and public sector spending are to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
be taken at face value, we can only assume that in the coming few years there will be significant job losses throughout the public sector. I have examined the Welsh Office budget. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Monmouth regards table 5B.4 on page 118 of the Red Book, which gives spending in real terms, as a funny money table. Its purpose is to put Government spending into pespective and to relate it to their estimate of future inflation. The overall impact is that at least it will keep pace with inflation and that in some sectors there will be cuts.<br><br>
I attempted to challenge the Secretary of State earlier—from a sedentary position, I admit, Mr Hughes—about the true value of the money figures in the Red Book. The right hon. Gentleman said that, even though the real increase could be computed at less than 1 per cent. the Government hoped to do much better in Wales by getting value for money. How do we get value for money in local government services such as the fire service or education? There are two options. We either reduce the number of people working in local government, thereby cutting the cost of providing the same service, or we cut wages. There is no other way unless all spending on the maintenance of public buildings is suspended, and, Heaven knows, they are in a bad enough state as it is. There is no other way of getting value for money in public services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that value for money can be had by bringing about technological change? Improvements in technology are the usual way of achieving more effective service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that technological change can bring about savings. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman of the number of instances in which technological changes undertaken in Wessex and the west Midlands have cost the public services dear. The mistaken application of technology happens more frequently than he may wish to admit. There may be some scope for savings, but that will involve buying equipment and cutting jobs. Cost may be saved in, say, local government, but the unemployment budget will increase. The complexities involved mean that, although it may have an up side for a particular service, technological change has a downside in terms of employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend concedes, reductions in unit costs and higher productivity as a result of new technology can be achieved in a number of spheres. But can he suggest ways of implementing that on a broad basis given that yesterday's public expenditure statement cut capital expenditure in the public sector by £1.6 billion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. It will be much harder for local government and public services to introduce new technology. In making the point, my right hon. Friend reminds me that many local authorities and public services in Wales—the ambulance service in mid-Glamorgan, for example—already have state-of-the-art technology. I suspect that if we approached those authorities to discover what further savings were to be made over the medium term, there would be none on the technological front. The savings will be made in either giving lower pay or producing fewer jobs. That cannot be good for the Welsh
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0244">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
economy. Many references have been made to reduced housing provision, which will result in fewer jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke of technological change, I did not necessarily mean the introduction of new hardware; it could mean the introduction of improved methods.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I grant that that could be the case, but I suggest that those factors will be on the margins of any changes that could be made. The significant cuts that the Chancellor is seeking will not be achieved by the introduction of the sort of technological change to which the hon. Gentleman refers.<br><br>
On the theme of the Welsh Office budget and local government expenditure, I shall refer to what the Secretary of State said on 14 July. He was being questioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) over the real cost of the local government reforms, particularly the up-front transitional costs. He stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"I shall tell the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues more about the revenue side after the November settlement, when transitional costs, among other things, will form part of the discussions that I hold with my right hon. Friends about revenue support for local authorities." [<i>Official Report, Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 14 July 1993; c.3.]</p></blockquote>
I realise that local government reform has been put back for a year, but I presume that we shall be debating the Bill early in the new year. Therefore, some account of the figures in the Red Book must be related to the transitional costs of local government reform. When replying, I would welcome the Minister to refer to the promises made by the Secretary of State when opening the debate at the previous meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee.<br><br>
At a time when the Welsh Office budget is threatened with, at the very best, only maintaining pace with inflation, someone will have to bear the costs of local government reforms. Local government reforms are still deeply unpopular in Wales and still contain matters of deep dissatisfaction to the people of Wales. Although one of the four communities under dispute in my constituency was brought back into the new Bridgend unitary authority, the other three—where the people were adamant about remaining a part of the Bridgend unitary authority—had their wishes ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to remember the subject of the debate, which is the implications of the Budget. It is not about local government reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate, Mr. Hughes, that there was a danger of my straying beyond the bounds of the debate. I believe that the Welsh Office figures take account of the local government changes that will be dealt with in a separate Bill. I wanted to impress upon Welsh Office Ministers that the announcement about the boundaries is still entirely unacceptable to my constituents. Bearing in mind the extra money that is to be spent on carrying out the proposed reform, it seems foolish that so many people will remain deeply dissatisfied with it.<br><br>
The Budget contained a small item of good news for lone parents in Wales—the £28 child care allowance. I—and the Government—hope that it will enable lone parents to obtain work. I emphasise that that is only a small step in the right direction. If the Government were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
considering cost-effective investment in the Welsh economy, they could have put far more money into it. They will no doubt know of the project that has been under way for nearly 30 years in Michigan in the United States. Children who received high quality nursery education there were compared with others in the same community. After 27 years it has been shown that for every $1,000 spent on that nursery education, the state has saved $7,000. Fewer children with good nursery education commit crime. Such children stay in school longer and have fewer education problems. They obtain better jobs and they pay more tax. I commend the £28 child care allowance but I point out that it is a small start in providing a comprehensive education and child care service for young people. The Budget overall will be a disappointment to Wales and will make more people there worse off by this time next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Today's debate and the Opposition's response in the Chamber yesterday, show that the Opposition have not a clue what they would do about the country's budget. The right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith), the Leader of the Opposition, revealed that when, before the Budget statement, he began Prime Minister's questions by asking my right hon. Friend the Prime Miniter about the public sector borrowing requirement, an issue that he must, clearly, have considered the most serious facing the nation, as he chose that avenue and occasion to raise it. Directly after the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Leader of the Opposition complained that Conservative Members had cheered a Budget that had raised taxes and cut public spending. How else are a Government who face a public sector borrowing requirement of £50 billion to tackle it, other than by raising taxes and cutting public spending?<br><br>
It is only on the Labour Benches that there is a belief that tax increases and public spending cuts can be avoided. We know that from the remarks of the right hon. Member for Llanelli, who, broadcasting to Wales this morning, declared, somewhat at variance with the remarks of the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East, that concern about the present level of the public sector borrowing requirement was no more than a fetish. He said that it is no problem funding such a deficit.<br><br>
Although the right hon. Member for Llanelli was not present this morning, I explained to him in the meantime that I proposed to raise the matter of the PSBR in Committee this afternoon, and gave him some details. The implication of what he said is that a Labour Government could continue borrowing at the present rate indefinitely. That seemed to be confirmed by some of the interventions that we subsequently heard from the Opposition Benches. That appears to be the approach of Labour Members.<br><br>
During the debate we received other insights into the possible Labour approach. The hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Harrison), said that the Government should raise the higher rate of tax to 55 per cent. He argued that that would be fairer. I am not sure how many Opposition Members applauded that idea. It is—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The former Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), seems to approve, although I do not recall that being part of his campaign at the general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
election. We look forward to the next general election campaign to see if the Labour party puts forward that idea.<br><br>
It is important that throughout the debate leading up to the Budget the Labour party's spokesman on financial issues said that the entire public sector borrowing requirement could evaporate overnight if only the Government would deal with tax avoidance. There is no more spectacular way of feeding the tax avoidance industry—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes, I appeal to you for advice. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor made a statement about another hon. Member which is simply not true. I appeal to you to ask him to withdraw his comment or to quote exactly what was said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say, then, "a significant proportion of the public sector borrowing requirement" would evaporate? No one could take exception to the accuracy of that.<br><br>
There is no more spectacular way of feeding the avoidance industry than to raise the higher level of taxation to 55 per cent. Such a suggestion shows how out of touch Opposition Members are.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) referred scathingly to the job seeker's allowance and the Leader of the Opposition described it as "odious in the extreme". The arrangement will not come into operation until April 1996, which will be the fourth year of this Government, and we again look forward with interest to see whether abolition of the job seeker's allowance forms any part of the Labour party's proposals to the electorate when it next faces it.<br><br>
The Government had to address the level of the public sector borrowing requirement. That will not be popular. No Government could expect otherwise. It was bound to be an austere Budget, but, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, it was a no-nonsense Budget. It has placed the country's finances on a sound footing. It was necessary for my right hon. and learned Friend to do that without damaging the recovery or confidence in the economy. The key is the maintenance of low inflation. I am not surprised that we hear so little about that from Opposition Members because they have not a clue about how to achieve low inflation, as their record in office demonstrates.<br><br>
Only by maintaining low inflation will we be able to have the jobs and growth upon which expansion of the economy depends. Our first duty has been to maintain that confidence by dealing with the fears about VAT on fuel, which Opposition Members have unceasingly fostered among pensioners. There has been a targeted campaign by Labour Members to foster those fears, exacerbated by the comments of some Opposition Members during our debate. They targeted the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan, as he feelingly told the Committee. They also decided to target me.<br><br>
The result of that campaign has been to raise real fears among some of the most vulnerable people in Wales. That was demonstrated only yesterday when a gentleman in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
Llandrindod Wells, who was speaking to me on the radio, told me that he expected his bills next year, when VAT will be 8 per cent. to be at least £5 a week more. If that were so, his domestic fuel costs would be £3,250 a year. Of course, that is not what his bill will be, but that is how much he believed that he would have to pay as a result of the scaremongering tactics of Opposition Members.<br><br>
Mr. Peter Kellner is better known as a television colleague of the right hon. Member for Islwyn than as a friend of Conservative Members. Those of us who saw Mr. Kellner's face when the results of the general election became clear had no doubt whatsoever about where his sympathies lay. But even Mr. Kellner, who can hardly be derided by Opposition Members as a friend of the Government, confessed astonishment at the generosity of the VAT package announced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor. The VAT package was generous and was associated with many other measures which have already been referred to by other hon. Members during the debate—not least those measures relating to home energy efficiency, which is a matter of the utmost importance.<br><br>
It is important also to refer to remarks on the effect of the Budget on business in Wales. I am very pleased that help will be given on the uniform business rate, which is of real concern to many small business men in my constituency. However, I repeat to Ministers in the Welsh Office my concern that the arrangements to assist business people who are in particular difficulty—the measures under section 49 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988—are still not working efficiently in Wales as a whole. I raised the matter in a debate last year. Although two applications have been granted in councils in my area since then, insufficient use is still made of section 49 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and—<i>[Interruption.]</i> May I say, Mr. Hughes, that this matter is of great concern to my constituents, who have written to me on many occasions? I object to the barracking that is taking place while I am trying to raise it with Ministers. They know that I have written to them several times this year about the issue, and I ask them to give it attention.<br><br>
I welcome also the arrangements relating to the statutory audit requirement. I disagree with those Opposition Members who claim that accountants will find another way of charging their fees to small businesses in Wales. A group of accountants in the Crickhowell and Brecon area of my constituency came to lobby me to ask specifically that this change be considered in the Budget. They will be delighted to hear the news, so it was particularly disparaging to say that they would be trying to find another way of loading costs on to their clients. The change has been made to assist business people who do not need the additional bureaucracy of the audit requirement, and it will be welcome in the year ahead.<br><br>
I welcome the proposals to raise the VAT threshold. Although I make common cause on this point with the right hon. Member for Islwyn, I want swifter action taken on late payment of bills. I adopt what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery—there are many payments that come from the Welsh Office, not least in relation to the sheep annual premium scheme, for which we waited very much longer than for payments from English Departments. It is an issue on which progress begins at home.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
All these issues are important because new jobs in Wales will be provided substantially by small businesses, as they have been before. If Opposition Members want to know which sector of the economy will produce new jobs in Wales, I can tell them that it will be the 300 businesses that each take on one additional worker, rather than one business with 300 jobs, which arrives overnight. I welcome the fact that the Government have recognised the important role of women in the workplace in Wales. I detest the fact that the role of women in the workplace is so often derided by some Opposition Members who complain that all the jobs in Wales that have been created during the 1980s are for women. I have heard that said on several occasions.<br><br>
Only a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity of launching the Kid's Club Network in my constituency at Llandrindod Wells, where training and enterprise councils, both in Powys and in so many other areas throughout Wales, are involving themselves in child care schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I dispute the suggestion that Opposition Members have not welcomed an increase in women's jobs. The point we made, which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor failed to acknowledge, was that the Government have presided over a collapse in male jobs—many in manufacturing—which commanded much higher salaries than the women's jobs that will replace them, many of which are part time. The hon. Gentleman seems to be ignorant of that gap in the employment market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the remarks of Opposition Members.<br><br>
The announcement relating to child care for those on family credit is to be welcomed. It is excellent that we have avoided a broad spread of the VAT base. I have received representations on that issue, as have many hon. Members. I particularly want to mention two youngsters who lobbied me on that issue today—a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old, Anna Daukstay and Lorna Felgate, who have been present during our proceedings. They were especially interested in the issue of VAT on books. I am delighted to see young people taking an interest in our proceedings and I commend those two girls for their interest.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the issue of public spending. We should support the overall reduction in public spending that the direction of the economy necessitates. A reduction in several budgets is inevitable, although I welcome the announcement that the education, health and social security budgets will be protected and will receive substantial increases. However, although I accept the need for a reduction in the agriculture budget, I must express my disappointment that a major part of that budget cut will come from the hill livestock compensatory allowance. If the budget must be reduced, that reduction should be spread across all areas of the agriculture budget. It is misleading to say that there has been an overall increase in income in the hills of Wales. I have more than 30 cases—which I have communicated to my hon. Friend the Secretary of State—of constituents who do not receive Government subsidy, either because they are part of farm partnerships where changes have taken place or because they are share farmers or new entrants to farming. Those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
people have not seen the results of the increases that have been made during this year.<br><br>
In particular, I want to mention Janet Healey who is the Welsh young farmer of the year and who was at Westminster last week. She is a young girl who is farming with her husband on a small piece of land in my constituency—someone without a substantial income and with no Government subsidy at all who faces a second cut in the HLCA. That will be a substantial blow to her.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food refers to the fact that CAP spending has increased by £130 million this year. That is true, but a substantial amount of that goes to fund arable aid schemes in England, which are significantly more advantageous than the Welsh scheme. I urge the Minister and the Government to spread those cuts across all programmes in the Department.<br><br>
Otherwise, tough and austere though the Budget is, it is sound. It achieves the right balance between taxation and getting a grip on public spending. That is the only way in which we can maintain the low inflation on which, ultimately, jobs and growth in Wales depend.</span></p>
<p>5.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a bold speech from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor, who sought to work up enthusiasm for the absurd proposition that only a Conservative Government can deal adequately—or at all—with the public sector borrowing requirement created by a Conservative Government. He forgets that the £50 billion deficit is a result of the mismanagement of the past years. He is talking not about a new Government but about one that has been in office for as long as the little girls that he mentioned can remember.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also forgot that many changes have occurred in spite of specific promises about public expenditure and taxation that were made at the last election. I am reminded of the remarks attributed to a reporter who interviewed the famous Governor Huey Long of Louisiana. A day or so after he was elected, the Governor speedily broke all the promises that he had made to get elected. The reporter said, "Governor Huey Long, how do you justify that?" He said, "I just lied." Had the Prime Minister or the Chancellor admitted that they had lied, there would have been at least some honesty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not say that the Prime Minister or the Chancellor have told lies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Hughes, I was attributing lying to Governor Huey Long of Louisiana.<br><br>
To ascertain the impact of the Budget on Wales, we must take into account the special characteristics of Wales and work out the profile of Wales, which still has great poverty, low incomes and regional sparsity. It is clear that the increases in taxation and the reductions in public expenditure, which are larger than anticipated, will have a greater impact on Wales.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has a problem. He has to satisfy two contradictory constituencies—the natural political constituency that he believes will bring ideological fervour to the right-wing cause, and the needs of the people of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0247">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
Wales. In so far as he pleases one constituency, he displeases the other. He is a natural political schizophrenic.<br><br>
I shall mention briefly some of the ways in which the Budget will hit Wales. The sale and disposal of Ministry of Defence land and housing will have a particular impact on west Wales. We understand from the Secretary of State for Defence that £500 million is budgeted for receipts from that source in 1995–96. That will be counted as revenue <i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed, it is an accountancy trick. It is a one-off operation and will have major distorting effects on the housing market in those areas with defence installations. Was the Secretary of State consulted about the local market implications of the crowding out at City level of the £500 million of receipts now that the Housing Corporation receives £700 million a year from City syndicates?<br><br>
I have two other quick points to make about local authorities and education. All one hears about the local authority settlement is that it will be virtually nil in relation to actual expenditure over the current financial year. The increments for local authority employees mean that there will be virtually no recruitment for Wales which will blight the prospects of many of our young people.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to busmen paying for lawyers. Is he aware that the key effect of preventing local education authorities from paying post-graduate discretionary grants for lawyers is that we will restrict our future solicitors and barristers to those from relatively comfortable backgrounds and will prevent working-class children in Wales aspiring to become lawyers? Does the Secretary of State approve of that?<br><br>
Finally, this Budget, with its illusionism and magical tricks, gives a bad name to creative accounting.</span></p>
<p>5.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and flag up three problems that I foresee the Budget will pose for rural Wales. First, the increase in the price of petrol—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are several Committees going on in the Room, but at present I am interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who knows anything about rural Wales will appreciate that a motor car is not the luxury item there that it may be considered to be in central London. The 13p to 14p increase in the price of petrol will be very damaging all round. I am sure that other hon. Members have reflected with great anxiety on the announcement of the rise. The increase will amount to 40p over the next three years. I trust, even at this late stage, that the Government will reconsider. The Chancellor's assertion that he was honouring the Rio commitment by putting 14p on petrol is both ridiculous and insulting to all hon. Members. The Government's bungling has left rural Wales in a difficult position. The price rise will hit everyone. It will fuel inflation and create the most horrendous problems in rural areas.<br><br>
The second problem to which I should like to draw attention in the short time available to me is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. That is also a deeply flawed move. Despite all the Chancellor's tinkering at the edges yesterday, with the so many pence per week that he is prepared to release, the proposal simply is not good enough. I am very worried about it: it is immoral and abhorrent to anyone who is concerned for the people of Wales. I hope and pray that the worst case scenario—in which people are forced to choose between food and heating and as a result die of hypothermia—will not come about. However, I am afraid that common sense suggests that the risk is very great.<br><br>
There is one bright side to all the misery: the by-elections at Christchurch and Newbury showed what the electorate of the United Kingdom think of the measure. Equally, the people of Wales will come to a similar opinion and will vote with their feet at the next election. They will not wear it: the Government will realise that they cannot ruin ordinary people's lives just because they cannot run the economy. That is abhorrent, immoral and completely unacceptable.<br><br>
Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor, with the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and with the other hon. Members who have mentioned the HLCA cuts. The HLCAs were designed to compensate those who farm in very difficult conditions. Those conditions have not got any better. Over the past 18 months, the market has improved slightly. However, the market is a little odd, in that there has been some extra buying as a result of the quota system. More important, the devaluation of the green pound has been filtering through. The proposed cut of £25 million in HLCAs will devastate the industry next year. The impact may not be felt in the next three months or so, but the blow will be devastating in the next year and it will be the responsibility of the Government who, for two years running, have cut the lifeline of tens of thousands of upland farmers in Wales.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Government will have to pay the penalty for their mishandling of matters in Wales. Their standing has never been firm in Wales, but it will be even weaker after this Budget. There is no justification at all for the cut in HLCAs. It is a desperate measure, and does no more than to emphasise that the Government have no respect for the farming industry. We know that of old, but it has been proven yet again.<br><br>
Taken in the round, the Budget is extremely damaging to rural areas in Wales, which will be hit very hard indeed. Either the Government do not understand the special needs of rural Wales or—worse still—they do not care.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak about the effect of the Budget on Wales, it would be churlish not to take the opportunity to say a fond farewell to the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, who today undertakes his last duty as the PPS to the Secretary of State for Wales. We shall miss him as much as he will miss us—if only in a sado-masochistic way. He earned his promotion by knocking the right-wing, hon. Member for Reigate (Sir George Gardiner) out of the 1922 Committee. Only in the modern Tory party could one find someone like the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, who described the unemployed as "a bunch of layabouts".</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0248">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's tribute, but the debate is about the implications of the Budget for Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am leading into my remarks by referring to the fact that the hon. Gentleman described the unemployed as "a bunch of layabouts". Only in the modern Tory party could such a person be described as being involved in a left-wing coup. It is also relevant to today's debate to remind the Committee that the hon. Gentleman said that he would not employ most Ministers in his own business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cabinet Ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why we need to debate the impact of the Budget on Wales. I presume that the hon. Gentleman exempts the Secretary of State for Wales but, on the evidence of today's performance, he should include the Secretary of State in that condemnation, not for personal reasons—we have not come to know him yet—but because he has not yet adequately presented a programme on how the Budget will affect Wales. There was much "'Rah, 'rah, team!" in his speech, but not much about the effect of the Budget on Wales except generalities. We would expect a Cabinet Minister to say that the Budget was a good; but he did not say why.<br><br>
Apart from that, the Secretary of State said only that health and education would do relatively well. He also claimed that he had a cash increase of £320 million for the year starting next April. Like the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, we too wonder whether we would employ the Secretary of State in our businesses. Is it a rise or is it a cut?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caernarfon is not in his seat, but I believe that he acted as a management accountant in days gone by. He pointed out that in real terms the rise is very small—an increase of only £100 million from £6.1 billion to £6.2 billion and then £6.2 billion again. Then we heard talk about funny money and that as we ordinary, back-to-basics types talk only about pounds, shillings and pence, it was really a £320 million cash increase. The hon. Member for Caernarfon said that the figures are produced on a real-terms basis—what the Government will get for the money next year. However, the figures are from the Government's Red Book, which says that we must take account of a 3 per cent. deflator being applied, which will knock about £250 million off the apparent cash increase. Thus, the increase is very small indeed.<br><br>
In trying to work out whether it is a rise or a cut, one must then consider that the accounts show that last year's figure was £6.4 billion, not £6.3 billion, because the previous Secretary of State added £108 million of special allocations to Tai Cymru and to the local authorities if they sold some of their assets. Relative to today's public expenditure of £6.4 billion—not £6.3 billion, because of the addition of £108 million—next year could see a cut.<br><br>
We should consider a typical example and put that proposition to the test. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State could take particular note that the Government have cut £40 million from local authority expenditure next year relative to the previous planned budgets announced last year by the previous Secretary of State. A cut of £40 million next year followed by a cut of £80 million the year after that does not seem to me like an increase in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
expenditure. In other words, I am referring to minus £40 million and minus £80 million relative to previous plans. The Secretary of State owes us an explanation of his statement that if we forget about the funny money, we shall have an increase. I am sorry to say, however, that it seems as though we shall end up with a decrease.<br><br>
At least two councils have said that the measure represents a decrease. Given the thinness of the Secretary of State's speech, in which he made a slight remark about the health and education budgets in the middle of the Hallelujah chorus stuff for those who were true believers and would realise that there was something to believe in, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will advise the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the proper position before the hon. Gentleman winds up the debate.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to the virtues of the job seekers' benefit and of the invalidity benefit. A job seeker's benefit has redolent memories for many of us who live in south Wales. Even if we are not old enough to remember it ourselves, we know of those days in the 1930s when people were obliged to show that they had been searching for work. In the Rhondda valley, people would have to walk from the Rhondda Fach to the Rhondda Fawr and people from the Rhondda Fawr would have to walk across the mountains to the Rhondda Fach, saying "Hello" to each other on the way as they passed through Penrhys. People had to call in to the dole office in the other valley to demonstrate that they had been seeking jobs, even though they knew there was no work in that valley. All they did was to wear out their shoe leather. If no jobs are available, the Government must be careful when subjecting people to a test.<br><br>
The Government are now staking their reputation on the invalidity benefit. They say, "The health of the nation is improving, so how can more people be in receipt of invalidity benefit?" They intend to rename the benefit and call it "incapacity benefit". Instead of increasing the number of jobs so that a wider range of work is available to people, the Government have reduced the number of jobs and have made it far more difficult for people to claim invalidity benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred the choice of jobs for those in receipt of invalidity benefit. I draw his attention to the case of a person who was dragged before the board. Its members said that they accepted that he could not sit or walk for any length of time, but that he was capable of undertaking work as, a security officer at the local masonic lodge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a distinguished member of the funny handshake brigade, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State might be highly qualified to answer that point. Perhaps he can tell us about the jobs that are available as security guards in the lodges.<br><br>
In his remarks about the implications of the Budget for Wales, the Secretary of State said that there would be a slight increase in health and education expenditure, but he told us not to ask him too much about that as he was only the Secretary of State. The demands to put more resources into health and education will be enormous. At present, the health service in Wales faces an absolute crisis. At 8.30 am yesterday, the largest hospital in Wales—the University hospital of Wales, in the Minister's constituency—stopped all admissions. Its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
managers said that the hospital had no more beds and that they had informed the beds bureau, which covers the whole of south Glamorgan, that the hospital would receive no more admissions.<br><br>
I was advised that only five beds were available in the entire hospital service in south Glamorgan but that 19 patients had to be admitted on an emergency basis by their GPs. The five beds were all filled and the other 14 people had to be put in corridors in the Cardiff Royal infirmary. That is the sort of crisis faced by the health service in Wales. It needs more resources. Yesterday the idea that beds can be shut down without penalising patients was proved wrong.<br><br>
I refer to a patient from Neath general hospital who was desperately trying to be admitted to the chest ward in Llandough hospital. The hospital managers said, "Sorry, we cannot take you in. We have no beds." Yet all the time the drive is to try to remove beds from the national health service on the grounds that the men in grey suits would squeeze greater value out of the health service. Such a philosophy is appalling, because we know the effects of the action of such men.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is a great missionary of the idea that the men in grey suits should not be allowed to take over the health service, yet he said that he would get greater value out of health service expenditure in Wales. He thinks that inflation used to occur only under the old incompetents—the former Secretaries of State for Wales—such as the right hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hunt), the Lord Walker of Worcester and Mr. Nicholas Edwards, a former Member of Parliament for Pembroke. Now that Rocky is here, there will be no more such nonsense. His pound will go much further than the pounds spent on the health service by the three previous Conservative Secretaries of State. What a lot of nonsense.<br><br>
We know about the problems in my constituency in respect of orthopaedic treatment at Rhydlafar. The men in grey suits said, "You must use this cheaper artificial hip joint—the Zimmer CPT." The Zimmer CPT hip joint has been put in about 40 people in the past four or five months. I am told that it is dislocating all over Wales. Five people had it taken out and replaced. One can imagine the trauma that those people suffered, all because of an attempt to get the greater value for money that the Secretary of State seeks. He said that we could ignore predictions that not enough money would go into health and education, in spite of the modest rises to which he referred.<br><br>
When accountants and ex-merchant bankers—such as the Secretary of State—boast that they will get more value for money out of the health service, I tell patients in Wales to beware, because that will mean cheaper products being put into their bodies in operations and cheaper drugs. Such a policy does not maintain medical care standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those problems are occurring now. I am not shroud-waving. I am describing what is happening in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Scaremongering.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It cannot be scaremongering if it is occurring now. The problem with the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West is that if his world does not fit with the facts, he ignores the facts. We fear that as a result of cutbacks in expenditure on housing—about which the Minister said nothing—there will be big job losses in the construction industry. We fear that Tai Cymru's budget will be reduced so that it will not be able to get much in the way of new orders next year. The same applies to improvement grant expenditure.<br><br>
The impact of cutting back improvement grant expenditure—we understand that it will be halved—in an area such as Wales, where so much housing was built between 1870 to 1914, will be enormous. That housing needs substantial modernisation. Cutting back improvement grant expenditure will have an enormous impact on the quality of the housing stock, heating bills and employment in the construction industry. That employment industry is collapsing, but that does not show up in the employment figures. If a man is self-employed—as most people in construction are—and if his wife has a job, he becomes unemployed but is not on the unemployment register because he cannot claim benefit. There is a vast amount of hidden unemployment in the construction industry.<br><br>
Another problem that has not been given any attention is negative equity, which affects 42,000 people in Wales. The Budget will not do much for them, and they are unlikely to get back their confidence to start spending again.<br><br>
People are facing all sorts of additional taxes. There are taxes on petrol, which will have a devastating effect. Allowances will be frozen, and anyone who tries to get away from it all by flying out of the country will be taxed.<br><br>
The Secretary of State must spend more time in Wales in order to learn about the problems there. Earlier, he gave a speech that might go down well in Wokingham Rotary Club or even the Wokingham masonic lodge, but it will not go down well in Wales.</span></p>
<p>5.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek to follow one of the more entertaining speeches of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. He made a wonderful attempt to pack in the maximum number of words per minute;—words of dubious relevance to the debate, if he listened to it—without paying attention to how they inter-connected. As a direct response to the hon. Gentleman, we shall shortly issue a statement of our spending programme for the national health service in Wales. That will be another real terms increase in funding and I am sure that it will lead to another real terms increase in the quality of health care and the numbers of patients being treated.<br><br>
We have had a relatively positive debate, with positive contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Monmouth, for Vale of Glamorgan and for Brecon and Radnor. There were also positive references in the contributions of the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, for Yns Mon, and for Bridgend, and of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery.<br><br>
The foundation for the positive start to our debate was most evidently laid by the opening speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He concluded by inviting the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0250">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
hon. Member for Caerphilly to respond in a like way and positively to set out his proposals for Wales moving forward from the Budget. What Budget might the hon. Gentleman have sought to introduce? What did he do to fight for Wales in the shadow Cabinet? As my right hon. Friend feared, answer had we none.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly began by saying that he was not going to disappoint us—he was not going to be positive. He reminds me of Errol Flynn—perhaps he might like that allusion to someone of whom it was said, "You always knew where you were with Errol Flynn—he always let you down."<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan pointed out that there was no response. We can only interpret that as meaning that the hon. Member for Caerphilly did not fight for Wales in the shadow Cabinet and was unable to demonstrate that, by a single shadow penny, Wales has done badly. That is the only interpretation that we can put on the hon. Gentleman's silence.<br><br>
The only positive contribution from the hon. Member for Caerphilly was his lame defence of the last Labour Government and his implication that he would fight the next election by offering the people of Wales the same as they had before, in the 1970s. The hon. Gentleman met his match in the immediate rebuttal from my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth who reminded us of the facts of the 1970s—record inflation, negative interest rates and attacks on all, especially on pensioners whose savings and pensions were cruelly ravaged by inflation during those years.<br><br>
For a party that says that it does not believe in market forces, Labour unleashed the worst of all market forces with the most savage chase of pay increases following price increases, to the great detriment of the whole nation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was proud of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend implies, the hon. Gentleman would offer us the same again if ever Labour was returned to power.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman adduced a litany of statistics and sought to compare his constituency and others with that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He said that he was not jealous of Wokingham but the obvious conclusion was that he was quoting H. G. Wells—he has seen the future and it works. My right hon. Friend is well aware of conditions in Wokingham. As he has said so many times, he wants the advantages that were so hard fought for and won in Wokingham for every part of Wales. Therefore, unlike Opposition Members, we should set our sights at the highest to achieve the greatest.<br><br>
At the last election, the Labour party sought desperately to conceal its spending policies because high spending would inevitably lead to high taxation. However, there are some aspects that Labour Members cannot dodge. Certainly, they cannot dodge that they would make the people of Wales pay more just for being Welsh. They would impose that ultimate quango on the people of Wales without consultation—a quango that, in a centralising manner, would take power away from local government and the office of the Secretary of State for Wales and substantially increase spending.<br><br>
Equally, Labour Members cannot dodge their commitment to the European socialist manifesto, which would greatly add to our costs.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must refer to the implications of the Budget for Wales. We are not concerned with the matters to which he is referring at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very much so, Mr. Hughes. A central part of what the Government seek to achieve is to maintain recovery from the recession and to seek more jobs, especially for Wales.<br><br>
If we followed the job-destroying policies of the European socialist manifesto—as advocated by the Opposition—which have been costed at 2 million job losses in Britain, the cost in Wales would be at least 100,000 more unemployed people. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor emphasised, we seek to create employment; the Opposition wish to create unemployment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly spoke in the debate, as did the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, who made a positive contribution with his impassioned speech. He said, unlike some of his hon. Friends, that the situation in Wales is different from what it was in the 1930s. He introduced some interesting arguments when he suggested that he was agin the dependence culture, but then went on to complain about props being taken away. He welcomed many things in our programme for the valleys, such as the invaluable new jobs, but regretted the loss of manufacturing jobs. When we consider the programme for the valleys, we should all agree that it is already a success. Its unique feature was to bring together virtually the whole range of the Welsh Office's responsibilities and apply them to a comprehensive programme for a particular area. Like the hon. Member for Merthy Tydfil and Rhymney, I want unemployment levels to fall still further. The latest programme for the valleys is aimed specifically at tackling unemployment, by focusing on creating more better-quality jobs and improving training, education and transport, with the obvious objective of benefiting local people.<br><br>
While the published estimates show a sharper fall in manufacturing employment in the valleys compared with the rest of Wales between 1988 and 1992–11 per cent. compared with 7 per cent.—it is still less than the fall of 14 per cent. in the number of employees in manufacturing in Great Britain as a whole over the same period. The valleys have fared better than Britain as a whole.<br><br>
The latest unemployment figures show a fall of 2.4 per cent. in the number of unemployed people in the valleys in the year to October. That can be compared with falls of 0.9 per cent. in Wales and only 0.7 per cent. in the United Kingdom. Unemployment in the valleys is falling faster than in the rest of Wales and the UK. We should not overlook the fact that more than 12,000 new manufacturing jobs have been added since 1988. That figure does not include firms that employ 10 or fewer people. More than 250 manufacturing plants in the programme for the valleys area have been opened since 1979, and they currently provide 16,000 job opportunities. In the past three years, more than 200 offers of regional selective assistance, worth nearly £95 million, have been accepted by companies in the programme for the valleys area. Associated company investment is £500 million and the projects are planned to create almost 9,000 new jobs and will safeguard more than 5,000 others.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred several times to what he called the Welsh Office's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
report. He corrected himself and pointed out that it is a report by Victor Hausner and Associates for the Welsh Office. I would hope that the hon. Gentleman and all members of the Committee would agree with the report's conclusion that the programme was a genuine and innovative attempt to define a comprehensive programme of action and that its high political profile was instrumental in its ability to bend existing programmes and to attract additional resources to the valleys.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Caerphilly and for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to incapacity benefit, which will replace invalidity benefit. Existing invalidity benefit recipients will transfer to incapacity benefit at the previous benefit rate, including adult and child dependency increases and invalidity age addition. It will not be subject to taxation. There will be no losers. Flat rate benefit will continue to be paid as of right, if contribution conditions are satisfied, while incapacity lasts. Benefit will continue to be uprated, as now, in line with retirement pensions. The key aim is to focus benefit on those generally incapable of work—the people for whom it was always intended.<br><br>

It is clearly wasteful and absurd to have two inconsistent benefits for the unemployed, with different rules, different offices and different systems, but paid at similar but different rates. It is therefore essential to bring them together into one integrated benefit.<br><br>

There will be transitional protection for people currently unemployed who will be able to continue to claim within their balance of entitlement. Furthermore, the new system will encourage working partners to stay in work by increasing the number of hours that they can work from 16 to 24 per week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I want to clarify the point. I was in the Chamber this afternoon, and I was misled either by what I heard in the Chamber or by what I have heard here this afternoon. Will you help the Committee to get a specific answer from the Minister as to whether existing claimants will have to pass a medical test to get incapacity benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. The hon. Gentleman should not accuse the Minister of misleading the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes. There is a limit to what I can say in the short time available, which is getting shorter. For further details, I refer hon. Members to the consultation document which was published today.<br><br>
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney for the "Source Wales" initiative. He also expressed support for the new scheme to introduce apprenticeships. To take that forward in Wales, we shall in the first instance concentrate on apprenticeships at technician level in engineering, in which surveys conducted by the training and enterprise councils in Wales show that there are real skill needs, and therefore jobs, for young women and men with technician-level qualifications.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth drew attention to the problems of the M4 corridor. The M4 motorway development has been—and continues to be—a hugely important factor in promoting new investment right across Wales. By the spring of 1995, with the completion of the Baglan to Lonlas section, the M4 will provide a continuous 200 miles of motorway from London to Pont Abraham. But Welsh Office investment has not just been in the motorway. The A465 has been transformed over the past decade. Only today my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a further £46 million for the A465 at Aberdulais to Glynneath. So we have upgraded the main trunk road connections both north and south of the valleys across Wales. In north Wales, similar investment in the A5 and A55 is fast providing a modern road access right across the country.<br><br>
We could easily have had too little time to debate the most important matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales. I think that the whole Committee has recognised that there has been a proliferation of what used to be called the "vision thing". We have had no vision and no hope from Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dishonest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to the Under-Secretary as dishonest, particularly from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to the Under-Secretary of State as dishonest, Mr. Hughes. I meant that there had been a dishonest evasion of an undertaking made earlier on.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have tried to have a full debate. There is too little time to reply to all the points that have been made. The general tone of Opposition Members brings no hope for the people of Wales. It is little wonder that my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan was able to adduce the correlation that where there is despair there is a Labour Member of Parliament.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i> That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales.</p>
<p><i>Committee rose at Six o'clock.</i></p>
