THE WELSH ECONOMY</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[<i>Mr. John Morris.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that this afternoon we shall rise not later than 6 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of the Welsh Economy.</p></blockquote>
First, I am sure that the Committee will want to welcome back the hon. Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower) after his recent illness. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear".] We are all glad to see him looking so well.<br><br>
I trust that it will be for the convenience of the Committee that the first subject for debate in this Session is the Welsh Economy. It is the subject which, after all, is the dominant one for all of us who represent Wales, and it is right, before we move to discuss particular sections of the life of Wales, that we should have our priorities right and comment on the economy as a whole.<br><br>
Of course, as I have said repeatedly, we cannot divorce the economy of Wales from that of Britain. We share its economic chill winds and we share its sunshine. It is against this background that I hope that both sides of the Committee will welcome the progress made on our national current account and the fact that inflation, despite the gloomy forecast of some Opposition Members only a few months ago, is still down to around 8 per cent., and the battle against inflation is on course provided that we get sensible levels of wage settlements. Output has been rising this year well above 3 per cent., and though at a slightly lesser rate it is expected to grow again next year.<br><br>
These are sound indicators, indicators upon which Britain and Wales share increased strength and confidence. I believe that Britain as a whole, and Wales in particular, have made a great deal of progress in the last four years in fighting and overcoming the effects of worldwide recession.<br><br>
We have got on with the job of preparing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
for the future. Solid foundations have been laid because we decided that priority should be given to improving the infrastructure and industrial regeneration. During the life of this Government 58 miles of motorway have been completed in South Wales. We are in sight of a magnificent road right through from the Thames to very near the banks of the Tywi. This Government, because they made the road a priority, have got on with it, and everyone who cares for the economy of South Wales will view this accomplishment with pleasure and pride. The feeder roads will follow, but I believed it right to get on with the main artery first. We have already seen industry after industry—-and we shall see more—noting this important development in South Wales and deciding to come and settle here.<br><br>
Then there is the A55 North Wales route. The motorways in the Chester area are to be extended to give better connections with Deeside. Thereafter, I want to see a dual carriageway from Chester to the west of Bangor.<br><br>
Work is expected to start next year on two schemes, costing about £4 million—the Casino junction and the diversion east of Abergele. Planning is going ahead on the rest of the route. The A55 is my next priority in the trunk roads programme.<br><br>
We have continued to encourage the diversification of Welsh industry. I wish particularly to refer to the advance factory programme. We took the decisions to build advance factories, although they are only part of the answer. We were criticised for our inability to let the factories immediately they were built. The policy of continuing to build in the face of letting difficulties was scorned by Opposition Members. We continued, and I believe that the policy has been vindicated. I have authorised the building of nearly 400 factories since I took office. The bulk of them are either built or under construction, and we are letting them. Firm lettings this year come to 86, and this includes the lettings of seven more factories being announced today. That is over 1 million sq. ft. of factory space let this year, providing opportunity for employment for some 4,500 people. There will be further lettings before the end of the year. Indeed, we currently have no fewer than 74 provisional allocations on the books. I expect the final tally for 1978 to be a "ton"—that is, 100. Indeed, I am confident that we shall be there or there-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
abouts—in other words, about four times the level in 1977 or 1976—a remarkable achievement.<br><br>
Another indicator of the upsurge in activity is the number of applications for regional selective assistance under section 7 of the Industry Act 1972—a good innovation of the Opposition which we have built upon by marketing it in order to encourage investment. The result is truly impressive. Since April 1974 over 600 offers of assistance under section 7 totalling over £50 million have been made, to create or safeguard more than 45,000 jobs. Since the beginning of this financial year applications are 25 per cent, up on last year in terms of numbers, nearly 30 per cent, in terms of jobs, and nearly double in terms of project costs—that is, investment. Twenty-four of the 136 applications this year so far are for projects costing over £1 million apiece, and one application in four is in respect of greenfield projects.<br><br>
I turn now to what is associated with section 7 assistance, namely, a scheme whereby European Investment Bank loans can be made available through my industry department. It is a scheme which provides cover to companies against fluctuations in the exchange rates.<br><br>
We have already cleared seven loans totalling £2¾ million with the bank, another nine totalling over £6 million are under consideration, and a further three very large ones totalling over £10 million are being negotiated by the companies concerned directly with the EIB. The rates of interest on these loans are very favourable, and we have missed no opportunity of encouraging firms in Wales to apply for this facility.<br><br>
It is against this picture of, a great deal of progress being made that nevertheless, regrettably, levels of unemployment both in the United Kingdom and on a Welsh basis remain too high.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I hope not to be unduly interrupted because I do not want to take too much of the Committee's time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwynfor Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Secretary of State. Of all the projects, schemes, advance factories, improvements in roads and so on, how much applies to the rural areas of Wales outside the DBRW area?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will seek to give some figures. I can give the hon. Gentleman an indication that advance factories have been built right across Wales, inside the DBRW area and outside. I shall come to the DBRW in a moment. Of course, the road building is of material assistance right across South Wales and, in turn, North Wales, rural and urban areas. My hon. Friend will seek to deal with the details when the opportunity arises, if he catches your eye, Mr. Davies.<br><br>
I was dealing with the picture of unemployment, which is unhappily far too high. But even so, the picture is not all gloom by any means. The unemployment figures for November show that for the second successive month the number of unemployed people in Wales was lower than it was 12 months previously, and it is five years since we had this kind of improvement.<br><br>
This is a welcome drop in unemployment but, of course, still not good enough.<br><br>
Since unemployment among young people must be a cause for special concern, the fall in the number of unemployed school leavers is encouraging. I remind the Committee that when we met in June this year I reported that 15,600 school leavers registered as unemployed in August 1977 and that this total fell to below 5,000 by January 1978. As I forecast at that time, the number of school leavers seeking work in August this year has been greater—we all know that the number of youngsters coming on to the labour market is increasing—yet in the three months since August 1978 the number has fallen from over 16,500 to below 5,000—a notable improvement on the position last year.<br><br>
I yield to no one, either in this Committee or outside, in my concern for a decrease in the level of unemployment, but what is not always recognised is the increase in the number of people coming on to the market. We should not overlook the fact that the number of people at work in Wales this year, at June 1978, is higher than at any June in the past decade. Admittedly, unemployment has increased, but this is significantly because the supply of labour has been rising fast. Therefore, it is right to get this matter in its proper perspective.<br><br>
We have some way to go, but the gap between the unemployment rate in Wales and Great Britain has narrowed over the years.<br><br>
I suggest to the Committee that, given the difficulties that the industrial world in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0104">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
general, and Wales in particular, has experienced, this is no mean achievement.<br><br>
There is, of course, more to be done, and particularly in youth unemployment. That is why I am taking such a keen personal interest in the Manpower Services Commission's new youth opportunities programme. This programme has got off to a good start. The commission is confident that it will meet the guarantee that no Easter or summer school leaver who remains unemployed by the following Easter should be without an offer of a place on the programme. Within the next week or so I shall be meeting the chairman of the MSC Committee for Wales, together with the three chairmen of the area boards responsible for the youth opportunities programme in the different parts of Wales, to take stock.<br><br>
I am sure that the Committee will have welcomed the recent announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment that from next January the small firms employment subsidy scheme is to be extended and will be available to small firms in the non-manufacturing sector in the development areas and special development areas. To date, SFES has been paid in respect of 2,892 new jobs in Wales, and I am sure that the extension of the scheme to the non-manufacturing sector will be of particular benefit to the Principality.<br><br>
We have already debated the WD A, and the only factor I wish to mention today is its industrial investment. In its industrial investment role, the WDA has now built up an investment portfolio totalling over £9 million. It is estimated that the jobs saved or created by these investments will total some 2,600. Many of these investments have been in the small firms which are so vital to the economy of Wales. In those cases the agency's intervention will have been doubly valuable, since the provision of expert advice by the agency's small business unit often goes hand in hand with the provision of a loan.<br><br>
I turn now to the DBRW. As Secretary of State for Wales and a native Mid-Walian, I am proud to have brought the DBRW into being and I am encouraged by what it has done so far. I felt when I took office that it was time to stop talking about the problems of Mid-Wales—Mid-Wales was sick of mere plans—and time to do something new and positive. Well, we have, The board took over its executive responsibilities on 1st April 1977 and, as its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
first annual report shows, it has this year made the best of starts.<br><br>
The board has been provided with adequate funds to meet its developing programme for the regeneration of industry and the economy of rural Wales. Expenditure during 1977–78 was about £5.7 million, and in the current year the total cash budget, including supplementary provision, is about £8.6 million. The board is confident that it will be able to use all these funds by the end of the financial year. Next year, I shall be seeking Parliament's approval for funds totalling £9.3 million.<br><br>
The board inherited 36 completed or partly-built factories for which tenants had not been found when it commenced work in April 1977, but by 31st March 1978 only seven of these were still available. This was an outstanding achievement by any standard, and I am happy to say that the trend in lettings is still firmly upward. To date, the board has let 468,500 sq. ft. of factory space and, with the let factories it inherited, the board's factories now provide some 4,500 jobs, with over 350 more in the offing from factories in the pipeline. The policy of building advance factories, be it in the WDA area or in the DBRW area, has been thoroughly vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarvon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way now. I gave way on 10 occasions in the debate on Monday, I hope that the Committee will allow me to get on with my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no one more generous than I in giving way. I do not want to deny the hon. Member, but it does delay the opportunity for others to take part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a very brief and specific point. I am very grateful to the Secretary of State. It is a matter on which there has been correspondence with him from my constituency and it concerns the boundary of the DBRW.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is right in saying that the DBRW is doing excellent work. Why will he not consider now, in view of its performance, the extension of the boundaries to include areas in both Gwynedd and Dyfed which very much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
want to come into the DBRW because of the nature of their terrain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The claim to come in is an indication of the success of the DBRW. The DBRW has only just started. Let it flex its muscles; let it have some experience. Parliament agreed that these should be the initial boundaries. One would have a claim for Carmarthenshire, for Pembrokeshire, for Caernarvonshire. Many of these responsibilities, certainly as regards factory building, are now in the bosom of the WDA. I have thought it right that the DBRW should be given a chance to get on with the job in this area and not to crush it with a responsibility which now the WDA has.<br><br>
At this point perhaps I should turn briefly—I apologise to the Committee for my brevity—to deal with the basic industry in the area in which the board operates, namely, agriculture. I hope that before very long the Committee will turn its eyes to consider rural affairs, including the DBRW.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be frank with the Secretary of State and say that I can hardly recognise the Welsh economy to which he has referred this morning. I am principally concerned about the statement in an article in <i>The Economist</i> of 18th November where it is suggested that the answer to the problems of the Welsh steel industry, which is so basic to us, is the closure of the Llanwern works. Will the Secretary of State confirm, clearly and categorically, that the British Steel Corporation has no plans whatever in that direction, and will he bear in mind that there has been a considerable improvement in the performance at the works in the last year or two and that reports of this sort are doing harm to morale—which is why I ask for this assurance now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know of my hon. Friend's concern about the BSC's operations at Llanwern and that he yields to no one in that concern. I am not aware of any plans of that sort to shut down Llanwern. Indeed, I remember an article only some years ago in the same journal indicating that the whole of the British steel industry, should be shut down and that we should buy all our steel from Japan. To such a report, as to the one mentioned by my hon. Friend, I give the same credence as we all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
gave to that sort of suggestion.<br><br>
As regards agriculture, I think we can say that generally 1978 has been a good year for farmers in Wales. Prices have held up for beef, and fat lamb prices have held up well. Milk sales have increased. There is the basis for confidence.<br><br>
May I say how heartened I was by the massive support for the retention of the milk marketing boards. A 99 per cent, vote in favour is a rare event in this country. I suspect that it happens in some other countries elsewhere in the world, which I need not mention, but 99 per cent, is a vote which I would very much welcome if it were in support of me. We can be heartened by the unity on this score. We can be quite sure that the high vote reflects wholehearted agreement on where the producer's true interest lies and endorses the role played by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture in Brussels last year.<br><br>
I turn briefly now to the Wales Tourist Board. Many jobs have been created through its scheme of assistance to the tourist industry to extend and improve its facilities. Up to the end of March, the board had passed on nearly £4 million in grants and loans to the industry since the scheme began in 1971, generating a total investment of nearly £9 million. A further £1J million is available to the board for this purpose in this finnacial year.<br><br>
I am sure that anyone who travels around Wales will have noticed the steady improvement in the standard of tourist accommodation throughout the Principality, although I readily acknowledge that much still remains to be done. For this reason, I was pleased to announce last week that I would be making an extra £200,000 available to the board in 1979–80 to extend the scheme to the intermediate areas—I know of the concern expressed time after time in the Committee on this score—which means that assistance to the industry is now available throughout Wales. I hope that the North Wales coast resorts in particular will take advantage of this opportunity to modernise their facilities to provide the sort of standards which attract the higher-spending visitors, especially those from overseas.<br><br>
I turn now to two sectors of our economy in Wales—Steel and coal—which will continue to need care and attention. The steel industry has faced and is still facing an unprecedented recession, a recession in demand which has affected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
steel makers throughout the developed world. This, of course, is of particular significance to us in Wales where the Welsh division constitutes about one-third of the British Steel Corporation. If we are to remain in this business we must be able to compete on equal terms with our competitors. This has called for unpalatable decisions. No one could be unmoved by the closure of the steel works at Ebbw Vale and Cardiff, areas with a long and proud tradition of steel-making and with a reputation second to none. But in grasping this nettle we are aware of the consequences for the communities involved and the enormous burden this places upon them. I shall say more about the additional support we are giving to these areas.<br><br>
I turn now to the coal industry, which continues to play an important role in the Welsh economy, although on a much reduced scale from former years. With the industrial recession and the slow pick-up in the demand for increased energy supplies, it is inevitable that the coal industry will continue to face difficult days ahead. But the Government have already demonstrated their support for the British coal industry, and for the South Wales industry in particular with its difficult geological conditions.<br><br>
Only last week, in a debate on the future of the South Wales coal industry, initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans), my hon Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Energy announced the setting-up of a subcommittee of the coal industry tripartite group to conduct a study of the South Wales coalfield. This will cover both the difficulties currently being experienced in the coalfield and the positive prospects for the future. The Welsh Office will be involved throughout with the working of the sub-committee. I have asked my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State to take on this impotrant job.<br><br>
We have already taken other steps to help South Wales. For example, £17 million is to be made available nationally to secure extra coal burn at power stations this winter, of which Wales gets its share. Exchequer assistance will be available to continue the earlier Government financial measures for extra burn of low-volatile coal in South Wales power stations which was first introduced in 1977. Apart from saving on expensive imports, this will mean that our valuable indigenous coal is being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
used rather than put into stock until Aberthaw "B" becomes fully operational shortly.<br><br>
In 1977–78 a total of £8.3 million was provided to the NCB to assist towards the cost of stocking coke, and recently we announced that £16 million for such aid would be available, with Parliament's approval, for the current financial year. This, I might add, is part of a five-year programme, estimated at £60 million, to help National Smokeless Fuels.<br><br>
The Committee can be assured that the Government will continue to keep very close watch on the problems of our coal industry. Our aim is to create jobs to replace those lost, whether in steel, coal or other industries. Let me turn very briefly from this general account to give specific examples of what is happening in some areas. I am sure hon. Members could give examples too.<br><br>
In Ebbw Vale, the Government, the local authorities, the WD A, BSC and many other bodies have worked together to develop the large industrial estates at Tafarnaubach and Rassau. The WDA itself has programmed 52 advance factories since April 1977, totalling nearly half a million square feet. The measure of the importance of these programmes is that the manufacturing firms which have already opened in Blaenau Gwent since 1973 now employ over 1,400 people, and some of these projects promise more jobs. In all there are now about 1,230 manufacturing jobs in the pipeline for the area.<br><br>
The agency is providing new factories on this massive Rassau site, some of which will be ready for occupation next spring. Here two factories have already been provisionally allocated, and that must augur well for the future.<br><br>
All this can be achieved only by hard work and attention to every possibility that might bring new jobs to Ebbw Vale. That is what is being done. Similarly the Government have announced a programme of assistance in Cardiff following the closure of East Moors steelworks. I took the chair at a large conference in Cardiff in April. All the various bodies are cooperating to provide new sites and factories and road links to them. Plans have been announced for 20 advance factories capable of supporting some 500 jobs initially and 1,000 after three years. The Welsh Development Agency is taking the lead in providing sites for further factories and in drawing up plans for the revelop-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
ment of the site of the East Moors steelworks itself.<br><br>
I turn next to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Coleman). Briton ferry at Neath is faced—I share this problem with my hon. Friend—with the closure of Duport steelworks. As soon as the Briton ferry closure was confirmed, West Glamorgan county council moved with all speed in opening negotiations for the purchase of the whole site—it is a super site, not far short of 200 acres—so as to develop it as a modern industrial estate. In the meantime, the adjoining BP Chemicals at Baglan Bay also indicated an interest in acquiring part of the site in order to safeguard its own long-term investment interests.<br><br>
I am pleased—as I am sure my hon. Friend will be—that the county council and BP Chemicals have now agreed on the area of land which is to be transferred to BP and on the detailed liaison and consultation arrangements concerning each other's developments.<br><br>
The WDA has also been keenly interested in the Duport site. I have assured it and the county council that as soon as part of the Duport site is ready for development, another programme of advance factories will be announced for it. The co-operation between the county council, the WDA and BP Chemicals—together, if I may say so, with the Welsh Office acting as catalyst—is a fine example of what can be done in dealing with a difficult situation. I am confident that out of adversity there will be developed a most attractive industrial site which will undoubtedly prove to be a winner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In connection with the provision of advance factories and new industries to replace the older industries, does the right hon. and learned Gentleman also envisage an expansion of retraining to meet the problem and assist the process?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is part of the continuing discussions I am having with the Manpower Services Commission. The commission is fully seized of the need to integrate the needs of training with the needs of incoming firms. So far, I have not experienced any difficulty, but this is one of the advantages of having decentralised responsibility for the MSC in Wales and also having the responsibility for industry.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
By so doing, I believe that we can dovetail the best arrangements possible to match the undoubted needs for training and the siting of industry. I am fairly confident that this will bear fruit. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to pinpoint this vital need.<br><br>
I turn briefly now to Wrexham, an area which suffers from severe unemployment. Here too, the efforts of the local authority, my Department and the WDA are bearing fruit. In April the new multi-million pound Kellogg Factory was opened. JCB has recently occupied a factory to manufacture transmissions for its excavators. E. Gomm Limited, the G-Plan people, has also recently occupied an advance factory. ERF Ltd. has announced a new £8½ million project to erect a new factory at the old Gresford Colliery site to manufacture commercial vehicles. Continental Cans (UK) Ltd. proposes to establish as soon as possible a two-piece can manufacturing plant on the former Llay Main colliery site at Wrexham; this is a £15 million project. Tetrapak Ltd. is currently building a 90,000 sq. ft. factory on a privately-owned industrial estate adjacent to the WDA estate. These developments, together with other smaller developments, should provide some 1,300 jobs in the Wrexham area.<br><br>
In addition to these manufacturing developments, the Inland Revenue will be setting up a PAYE office in Wrexham, providing about 230 white collar jobs by mid-1980. So here there is encouraging news, too, and I have only given a thumbnail sketch of what is happening in a few areas.<br><br>
Perhaps the most telling evidence of all in support of regional policies generally—with all the changes that have taken place over the years—is to be found in an analysis of the migration trends. We all know about the half a million people we lost in the inter-war years, when unemployment rates of 30 per cent, were commonplace and 50 per cent, not unknown. We all know that the Second World War shelved our problems for us but did not solve them. After the war, outward migration loomed large again.<br><br>
In 1951–61, there was net outward migration from Wales of about 35,000—that is, 35,000 more people moved out than moved in. In 1961–71, net outward migration was reduced to 10,000—the watershed was in the mid 1960s when we moved from a negative balance to a positive one,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
despite the massive loss of jobs in coal mining alone in the 1960s—an average of 5,000 jobs a year lost. The improvement was therefore evident, and this has been maintained—indeed, it has accelerated in the 1970s. In 1971–1977, there has been net inward migration of nearly 40,000—that is, 40,000 more people moved in than moved out.<br><br>
To have narrowed the unemployment gap and reversed the migration trends at a time when our older basic industries have shed so much labour is truly remarkable, and an indication of how regional policies are working. Despite all the difficulties, therefore, I believe that we can report genuine progress to the Committee, and this optimism in the face of adversity is borne out by the comments in <i>The Economist</i> two weeks ago. Perhaps I might quote them to the Committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hangdog defensiveness that used to greet the outside inquirer into the Principality's affairs has disappeared. Partly, of course, that is because of cultural, political and purely administrative changes in the way all Wales is run. But much flows from the ending of the physical isolation of industrial South Wales. It is no longer a corner for the dirty jobs that others prefer to forget.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"First, it has become a place where a national firm can logically set up a factory or a warehouse to serve markets almost anywhere in the southern half of Britain. Second, the improvement in the internal communications of South Wales means that it can itself be regarded as a single market; no longer a series of villages but a string of reasonably well-connected communities. Third, as its publicists emphasise to the point of boredom, it is the nearest place to the South and Midlands of England where labour is in surplus. Welsh workers have earned a reputation for adaptability and for getting on with the job."</p></blockquote>
That is the quotation, and that is what I endorse. It is tributes like these from outside that really count. What <i>The Economist</i> said last week is being said, and will be said more and more, by those who have come from outside Wales and have experienced the quality and the worth of our people in every corner of the Principality.</span></p>
<p>11.10 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I turn to what I regard as the central issue of our debate—though, interestingly enough, it was not mentioned by the Secretary of State—I want to refer to five specific matters. The central issue is the general economic situation against which his policies and the operations of individual companies have to be judged in the context in which they must be placed. The subject
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
of interest rates passed the Secretary of State by, and I should like to say something about that.<br><br>
First, I want to mention the five specific points: Ford; the vehicle excise duty; marginal land; our attitude to regional policy, and the special tourism grants.<br><br>
As regards the Ford pay settlement, we consider it unjust and constitutionally improper that, without the authority of legislation, Ford should receive arbitrary punishment at the hands of the Executive as a reward for suffering a crippling strike in defence of the Government's pay policy. That is the general point, but there is a more specific point that relates directly to Wales.<br><br>
It seems an act of incredible folly that, when the Government are handing out massive financial assistance to establish the £180 million development at the Waterton industrial estate, they are at the same time taking deliberate action to damage the company, reduce its profitability and make it less able to compete in world markets. In his statements the chairman made clear that that is exactly what the Government's action will do. That will do no service to Wales or to any other part of Britain. It will not help matters to turn Ford into another lame duck. The inconsistency and madness of a policy that combines handouts and penalties on this scale beggars belief. I fear that before long we shall discover that we have a real threat to the success of the Bridgend project. I hope that that fear will not be justified.<br><br>
Regarding the abolition of the vehicle excise duty, I simply utter this warning to the Secretary of State. While accepting that there are arguments in favour of such a change, my conclusion is that for Wales as a whole the change could be seriously damaging. The geography of Wales and the lack of an adequate transport system dictates the conclusion that the penalties for those living in rural Wales are so severe that they cannot be balanced by any gains elsewhere. Costs for individuals, for industry and business in many parts of Wales would rise devastatingly.<br><br>
The impact would be almost at its worst in those areas where geography already creates some of the biggest economic difficulties. The impact of the change would be almost directly contrary to the objects of regional policy, about which the Secretary of State has spoken, and especially so in the parts of rural Wales
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
away from the industrial heartland. I believe that the Secretary of State should be fighting his colleagues in the Cabinet over this retrograde proposal.<br><br>
In farming, the need to correct the distortion in the green pound remains the overriding priority. I should like to emphasise the significance of the marginal land question for Wales and to repeat the demands I have made previously for action on this matter. I gather from the Farmers' Unions that they are optimistic. But I was worried by the way the Under-Secretary apparently backed away at the last Welsh Question Time. I know perfectly well that he understands the case. About ½ million acres, or one-fifth of the area of agricultural land in Wales, is at stake.<br><br>
Is it the Government's intention to apply to the EEC for financial assistance to aid farmers within the marginal category. May we have some indication of their attitude on this matter?<br><br>
I do not often congratulate the Secretary of State, but I do so most warmly on his decision that the whole of Wales is to be eligible for grants for the special tourist projects scheme. That is an eminently sensible decision for which we have long pressed. My hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) has repeatedly bullied Ministers about it. The previous position existing under successive Administrations has been unsatisfactory and illogical. I welcome the change.<br><br>
I think that the tourist industry will now principally be pressing for Britain to join the other eight EEC countries in treating hotels and industrial buildings for taxation and capital allowance purposes. The proposal is particularly relevant for Wales where only 23 per cent, of hotel rooms have private bathrooms and only 42 per cent, have central heating. The truth is that we still have far too many old and decrepit hotels and we are not yet making the best of the potential of this industry.<br><br>
In a recent speech the Secretary of State launched a predictable and characteristically misleading attack on Conservative policies built on the insecure foundations of three or four sentences said to have been uttered by my right hon. and learned Friend the Shadow Chancellor at a press conference in Cardiff. As the Secretary of State has rightly been emphasising the importance of regional policy, I should wish to take this opportunity to make our position absolutely clear.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
We must have an overall backdrop against which industry can operate, and stability and confidence so that it can plan for the future. My right hon. and learned Friend had emphasised in Cardiff the need for tax cuts to create the right climate for industry, and he expressed the view that that would make a more important contribution than regional policies, however important, could ever be capable of. He also suggested that some changes in IDC policy might be needed to avoid creating new depressed areas in the Midlands and elsewhere.<br><br>
Let me repeat what I said in a speech in Cardigan on 17th November, so that there is no more nonsense uttered about this matter. Of course, we lay emphasis first on creating a competitive environment in which industry can operate successfully. Our incentive package would be the centrepiece of our policies. But we also believe that a strong, effective and stable regional policy will be needed for the foreseeable future. We therefore do not propose major alterations to the measures now in force. In our view, constant changes render regional policy useless, and we have no intention of adding to the chaos and confusion that has been created by the present Government. We believe that long-term stability is of great importance.<br><br>
But, like the Labour Government, we recognise that new problems have arisen in some of the previously prosperous areas. It is for that reason that the Government have launched various schemes to help the inner cities, and for the same reason have so relaxed the restrictions on the granting of industrial development certificates that since January 1976 about 722 IDCs have been issued and none—I repeat—none refused. That is the information provided by the Under-Secretary of State for Industry at Question Time just the other day. In the light of that fact, it is ludicrous to suggest that our modest proposal to raise IDC limits threatens the whole structure of regional policy.<br><br>
Of course, we are concerned about getting better value for money. We certainly think that there is a good case for relating assistance to projects more closely to the number of jobs they create. We would want to consult further with industry about that. It is a point about which I have heard the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) speak in the past. I do not consider it unreasonable to query some of the very substantial grants that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0110">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
go to individual capital-intensive projects and to question whether that is the best use of resources that will always be limited under any Administration.<br><br>
As for the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales, we shall keep them and support their work in stimulating and assisting commercial enterprise, about which the Secretary of State has spoken, although, certainly, as we have always indicated, we would wish to see safeguards over their powers to buy into profitable firms and ensure that they do not hold equity shareholdings in industrial firms on a permanent basis. I have spoken to members of the agency about that and they tell me that that would not interfere in any way with their own objectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merioneth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did I understand correctly, with reference to the Development Board for Rural Wales, that the hon. Gentleman now withdraws unreservedly the proposal made at a previous meeting of this Committee when he stated that he would review the relationship between the DBRW and the WDA? May we now be assured that the DBRW can carry on its work as an independent statutory body?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always indicated that I thought that the Government made a mistake in the particular way that they set the operation up. The hon. Gentlemans hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) has already shown this morning that he is not happy with the boundaries. We have no proposals to abolish either of these bodies, although I think that, after they have been in operation for a number of years, we shall have to review the relationship between them and the way that it is working. I do not believe that any Government could do less, and certainly I shall not indicate anything more.<br><br>
I congratulate the Development Board for Rural Wales on the work that it has done. It has got off to a successful start. I fully acknowledge that. But the question that has to be asked about these bodies at present is why, as was indicated in the Queen's Speech, they are to be given more money. I thought that it was a little curious that the Secretary of State had absolutely nothing to say on this point in his speech this morning. From information that I have received, I understand that at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
present they have spent only a fraction of the funds allocated to them by Parliament.<br><br>
In a recent parliamentary Answer I was told that so far the WDA had received £45.7 million against the total of £100 million allocated to it by Parliament, which can be increased by order to £150 million. Clearly, therefore, there is no need for an immediate increase. When listening to the figures for the Development Board for Rural Wales given by the Secretary of State this morning, I did not gain the impression that we were anything like up against the ceilings set by Parliament when the legislation was introduced.<br><br>
I therefore draw the conclusion that that fine statement in the Queen's Speech was put there not because there was any immediate need for these bodies to be voted additional money but simply because the Government wanted to buy nationalist votes in the House of Commons. As far as I can see, it was no more than a symbolic gesture to salve the consciences of Plaid Cymru members and the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) for sustaining a Labour Government in office. If there are immediate reasons for Parliament to be asked for more than it has already voted, I believe that we should be told what they are in this Committee.<br><br>
This debate marks the second anniversary of the last Welsh day debate in the House of Commons. Although these Grand Committee debates are important, I think that we are entitled to protest at the apparent abandonment of our long-established debates on the Floor of the House. It is not as if the Government are overpressed for business. I understand that the present intention is that we are to rise for the Christmas Recess on 15th December. I cannot see any excuse for the two-year interval that we have now had between general Welsh debates on the Floor of the House of Commons.<br><br>
One thing can firmly be said about these debates in the Grand Committee on the Welsh economy. They have a kind of gloomy similarity. For all the bubbling optimism and boasted achievements of the Secretary of State, the fundamentals do not alter. The central direction remains unsound. There is always some new event, some new disaster, usually Government-inspired to offset any modest signs of progress. The future always looks depressed and uncertain. So it is today. The principal comment of the CBI when I asked it for a report on the industrial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0111">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
atmosphere in Wales was that there was grave uncertainty about the future.<br><br>
It is true that, for the first time in almost five years, the Government can point to a tiny reduction in the number of unemployed, but the facts remain harsh. Unemployment in Wales this summer has, for the first time since the start of the last war, been over 100,000. Today, at 89,209, it is still higher than when we last debated the Welsh economy in this Committee in June. Despite all special schemes for school leavers, it is only very little less than the record post-war November figure recorded last year.<br><br>
There are still almost 5,000 school leavers unemployed, and, as I warned in June, the job opportunities programme is not solving problems. It is doing little more than postponing the evil day. The unemployed are being taken off the streets this autumn but, I repeat, large numbers will leave the programme next summer just as another year of school leavers are seeking jobs.<br><br>
The auditor-general's forecast, which is based on Treasury figures and was published earlier this week, shows that the Government expect no fall in the underlying level of unemployment next year. It is estimated that there will be more school leavers next year than this year. The combination of these factors—a high underlying rate, more school leavers and existing school leavers leaving temporary schemes—means that the prospect for next summer is grim indeed, with the probability that we shall once again see unemployment over the 100,000 mark.<br><br>
The Secretary of State talks about increases in output and in investment, and takes credit for the fall in inflation. But of course, his little pre-election consumer boomlet has been killed stone dead, and the manner in which that has been done is something to which I will return. As boomlets go, as a peak of this Government's economic achievement it really should not be a subject for boasting.<br><br>
In September Sam Brittan described the optimistic features in the economy in these terms. He said that they
<br><blockquote><p>"relate entirely to short-term variations of a business cycle stop-go kind. Any politician who cites them should be immediately reminded that underlying performance continues to deteriorate. Despite the present boom total output this year is unlikely to be more than 4 per cent, above the previous peak of 1973 even on the new re-based index. Without North Sea oil the rise would have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
been 2 per cent, or less than ½ per cent, per annum."</p></blockquote>
Manufacturing output in Wales is still well below the 1973 peak. Sam Brittan was writing before the Government published their economic forecast for 1979. Even on the extraordinarily optimistic assumption about the outcome of the present pay round that that economic forecast contains, it foresees a growth rate for 1979 down to a miserable 2 per cent. We should remember that the British economy has stood absolutely still—no growth at all between 1973 and 1977—while GDP advanced by over 12 per cent, in Japan and Canada, by 10 per cent, in France and by 8 per cent, in America and Italy.<br><br>
What has happened to all that marvellous North Sea oil? Back in 1976, in his letter to the IMF, the Chancellor was forecasting a balance of payments surplus for 1978–79 of between £2,000 million and £3,000 million. As recently as this year's April Budget, he was forecasting a surplus of £750 million. The Treasury is now actually forecasting a deficit, for both this year and next. That deficit is staggering when one remembers that the present contribution of North Sea oil and gas is estimated at no less than £5,000 million. Ignoring the North Sea benefit, the truth is that we have a balance of payments deficit of £5,000 million or more.<br><br>
I turn now to investment. We can all welcome the fact that the improved infrastructure is at last attracting more varied investment to Wales. Incidentally, when he refers to infrastructure, the Secretary of State should not try to take all the credit for the improvements. Almost all the 58 miles of motorway of which the right hon. and learned Gentleman boasted were put into the firm programme by my right hon. and learned Friend the former Secretary of State. The truth is that a continuing road programme has been taken on by Governments of different political parties over recent years. Nevertheless, I am not entirely sure that we should congratulate ourselves on what has been achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the cause for congratulation is that at a time of public expenditure restraint, which was urged upon this Government by the hon. Gentlemen's Friends in particular, the Secretary of State has kept the road programme in South Wales immune.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We never urged cuts in the road programme in Wales. I have never urged that we should cut it. The truth is that the Secretary of State's programme has fallen increasingly behind schedule. Only a few years ago, it was confidently forecast that the M4 would be complete right through to the end by about 1978–79, and with it the Carmarthen bypass. As the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) knows, we shall still have to wait a good many years for the Carmarthen bypass, and that is a major blockage to West Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want constantly to give way. The Secretary of State did not give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is talking about forecasts, he should know that my predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) repeatedly said that the M4 would be completed by 1976. When we took office, not a spadeful had been dug—not until 12th August 1974. As my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) indicated, we made it a priority and ensured that the funds were available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that it is totally absurd for the Secretary of State to take enormous personal credit for a programme that was prepared, planned and launched by my right hon. and learned Friend. That is unworthy of the Secretary of State and he should not attempt to do it. He should be worrying about the fact that under his guidance the programme has fallen even further behind schedule.<br><br>
I return to investment. The Treasury now states that investment will reach its peak in 1979 and that it will actually fall by 2½ per cent. Between the second half of 1978 and the second half of 1979. The Treasury also tells us that inflation will rise again to 8 per cent, or 9 per cent.—these are Government forecasts—even if the level of pay increases does not exceed 7 per cent. But pay increases will almost certainly exceed that figure, and that fact, combined with the consequences of the Government's excessive spending policies, makes it probable that inflation will be back in double figures by the end of next year.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
On the subject of excessive spending, there were some chilling reminders in this week's forecast from the London Business School in <i>The Sunday Times.</i> That forecast made clear that on the Government's present figures for monetary expansion and what we had last year, far from getting a 7 per cent, increase in earnings we are likely to get an increase of 11 per cent, or 12 per cent.—and that may be optimistic.<br><br>
Even more significantly, the London Business School forecast makes clear that, if the Chancellor is to achieve his present target for monetary increase, the present Government must cut public sepnding by about £2,000 million. That forecast reveals the inconsistencies in the Government's present policies. Something will give: the exchange rate—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way again. The Secretary of State would not give way; he said that we must press on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave way several times.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to make a speech. The exchange rate, the inflation rate or fiscal policy one of them must give. I suspect that the whole lot will cave in together. We shall have a falling pound, higher inflation, increased taxes and cuts in public expenditure. But I have on other occasions in this Grand Committee compared the long series of optimistic forecasts by the Secretary of State with the brutal realities, and I shall not weary the Committee by repeating the exercise today.<br><br>
There is one statement which I particularly like, and which has special relevance today. It was made by the Secretary of State in August 1977 when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The economic texture is brightening day by day in Wales."</p></blockquote>
Well, between May and October that year 14,000 people joined the dole queue. He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wales is on the move. Nothing has been more cheering for industry than the dramatic fall in interest rates since last autumn's crisis."</p></blockquote>
It was a fairly remarkable performance of the Secretary of State to make a speech lasting half an hour this morning about the Welsh economy and never once mention interest rates or the vicious increase that is now being imposed by the Government.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Because the Government have been spending too much, cracks have already appeared in their so-carefully-prepared pre-election window, and this brutal blow has now been dealt to the Welsh economy. The vicious and unnecessary increase in minimum lending rate has taken place because the Government have been spending and borrowing too much, forcing interest rates up in order to raise the money.<br><br>
The Welsh people are having to pay for the profligate folly of this Government through higher interest rates, higher mortgage rates and the loss of jobs. It was totally unnecessary. It was also totally predictable. Frances Cairncross forecast it in <i>The Guardian</i> at the time of the Budget under the headline "The Budget Time Bomb". The market forecast it at the same time with a fall of 23 points in the week.<br><br>
In that Budget the Chancellor announced increases in public spending of 6 per cent., a borrowing requirement of £8,500 million and, incidentally, outside the Commons a complete relaxation on the use of credit cards.<br><br>
He unleased what has justifiably been described as the most unhealthy consumer boom in Britain's history. Imports rose by 16 per cent, and exports by only 6 per cent. We used out oil money—that is where it has gone—to regenerate foreign industry. The result is that the cost of money today at 5 per cent, more than the going rate of inflation is higher in real terms than it has been for forty years.<br><br>
Nicholas Davenport, no Right Wing economist or monetarist, describing the consequences of what he called an ill-timed and outrageous rise, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It will not be long before the economy is plunged into an unnecessary and deep recession."</p></blockquote>
He went on to point out that the first industry to feel the slump would be the building industry and its ancillary trades and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many thousands of would-be borrowers will not be able to afford mortgages at these penal rates and will cancel their orders to buy or build. But do not imagine that this will bring down the price of houses. Wages will be going up and the cost of financing the building of a new house will go up. The millions of existing mortgage payers will have to suffer in three months time a sharp rise in their monthly payments and will then have to cut down on their living expenses. At the same time businessmen, with bank loans costing 12J per cent, or more, will be reducing their borrowings, cutting short expansion and cancelling plans for industrial investment which have become unprofitable at the new stinging rates of interest. So the immediate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
effects of this ill-timed credit squeeze will be a rise in unemployment and a rise in the rate of inflation."</p></blockquote>
That is the hard and brutal fact behind the Secretary of State's smooth words and optimism. Recovery, new investment, and, the hopes of millions have been strangled almost to death. Industry at all levels, traders, shopkeepers, farmers and home owners are all hit equally hard—and farmers especially hard because of the huge borrowings in that industry. Once again in farming costs of production will rise, there will be a cut-back of investment, a new brake on production and eventually higher prices for consumers. No one will escape the consequences of these events. We shall all pay the price of the Government's incompetence. That is the central and all-important reality behind this debate on the Welsh economy—poor, poor Wales.</span></p>
<p>11.40 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdare)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had from the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) an attack on certain aspects of the Government's policy, but what we have not had, yet again, are the alternative policies that would be pursued by a Conservative Government if ever the day came when they attained office again.<br><br>
In past debates on the economy this situation omission might have been forgiven, but, since there has to be a General Election before the end of next year, one of the virtues of the postponement of the General Election is that it gives the Opposition an opportunity to state what their policies are to be.<br><br>
It is true that during the term of this Government certain policies that they have pursued have become accepted by the Opposition. In the debate on the Welsh Development Agency there was strong opposition from the Tories. They did not want to see the Welsh Development Agency brought into being. They now say that they agree with it, that it is a good thing and that they will not endanger it. But we must recognise that, if we did not have a Labour Government in Britain, we would not have had a Welsh Development Agency.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Opposition speak with two voices on public expenditure. Apparently the Tories desire to increase public expenditure in all particulars, but yet wish to reduce it in general. They want to cut back public expenditure in total, but if one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
mentions individual items, they say "Yes, we agree with that, but we want more on the road programme, more on social services, and more on this, that and the other." However, they say catagorically on some policies that they want a massive increase—in defence expenditure, for instance. Yet by their peculiar arithmetic, they want in total to decrease public expenditure.<br><br>
I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales that we cannot separate the Welsh economy from the British economy. We are integrated as an economy, and it is a nonsense to talk about creating a separate economy in Wales from that of the rest of the people in this island. A leading article in the <i>Financial Times</i> a short time ago said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Each successive economic indicator makes it clearer that in real terms the United Kingdom economy is performing better than for a long time past."</p></blockquote>
Let us see what the <i>Financial Times/</i> has to say today, because there is nothing more current than today's newspaper. A report on the National Institute of Economics social research review, on page 26 of today's <i>Financial Times,</i> states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The economy is poised to expand further and faster."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned the review, has he also seen in that survey the forecasts that unemployment is likely to go up to two million?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the difficulty of giving way. I intended to deal with those points as I went along. The problem of unemployment, which I shall come to later, is a problem which certainly cannot be dealt with by Tory economic policies. That is the fact of the situation.<br><br>
We used to argue for Socialism in the valleys of South Wales for idealistic reasons. We must argue for Socialism today because technological and scientific advances mean that we must have a Socialist society to deal with the tremendous problems that confront us. However, I shall come to that point later.<br><br>
As for the economic indicators, we know that the pound is now firm. When the pound was in difficulties, we recall the Leader of the Opposition and leading Tory spokesmen standing at the Dispatch Box in the House of Commons week after week criticising the difficulties which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
pound was facing. However, it is now the dollar that faces difficulties, and the pound is in a firmer position. I suggest that that has happened as a result of the Government's financial policies.<br><br>
We are now paying our way in the world today. The revised estimates of the current account of the balance of payments in 1977 show a surplus of £289 million—the first since 1972. The current and capital accounts show the surplus of £7,361 million—the first since 1971, because already in 1971 the difficulties had begun to develop.<br><br>
We have heard from the Opposition the fact that, because of the special financial difficulties we face as a nation, we have had to borrow money. We have now repaid ahead of time 2 billion dollars of the debt to the IMF.<br><br>
Time and again in these debates we have had great play from the Opposition about the inflation rate. Inflation has now been reduced dramatically to a figure under 8 per cent. We still do not have a correct comparison with other countries because the rate is half what it was a year ago and lower than the inflation rate in the United States of America and in France. I think that the current figure is 7.8 per cent. Because of this and the substantial cuts in income tax during the year, the real living standards of the average family in Britain have improved by 7 per cent.—one of the fastest increases in a year since the end of the 1939–45 war. That is the type of progress that has been made during the present period.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said, unemployment in Britain in the past year has fallen by 90,000. I shall return to the subject of unemployment because, although progress has been shown in many economic indicators, the one thing which should be our main concern today is the present high level of unemployment in Great Britain.<br><br>
According to the European Commission, growth in this country will be higher this year than in any other country in the Community, except for Ireland. Private manufacturing investment rose by 13 per cent, last year—twice as fast as in Germany. Conservative Members always quote the advance that has been made in West Germany, but they do not tell us that there has been a Social Democratic Government in Germany for far longer than we have had a Labour Government in Britain, but I wish to emphasise that our investment has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
risen twice as fast as investment in Germany.<br><br>
When we talk about economic progress and the state of the economy we should also be discussing how we deal with our pensioners, the sick, the needy and the disabled. I believe that during this time of economic difficulty, the Labour Government have made great progress with social benefits. Pensions for a married couple are now to be increased to £31.20—a tremendous increase in money terms since the Labour Government came to power. But what is more important, it is an increase in real terms during this time of high economic recession. Again, child benefit has increased to £3 and next April is to be further increased to £4.<br><br>
One could give a catalogue of the achievements in social benefits. To my mind, that is a part of the real economy. In the control of money supply, the growth of sterling M3 averaged 9£ per cent, a year—only a third as high as in the last two years of Tory Govrnment.<br><br>
Although the world recession has had its effect on the situation in Britain, we know that quadrupling in oil prices has had its effect on the economy in Wales and in Britain. I believe that some of the problems we are facing are due to the effects of the last two years of Tory Government when they made paper money like confetti, and created the problems with which we have had to live from that day to this.<br><br>
I shall not go into the statistics of the opinion polls, but they made interesting reading. When one talks about what the people outside think about what the Government are doing, one can quote the most recent parliamentary by-election in Berwick and East Lothian in Scotland, where the Government did particularly well. If people have reservations about opinion polls, that perhaps is a better indication of what the people are thinking.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) is a hard-line Thatcherite, but although some of the opinion polls say that a diminishing number of people want a Tory Government, it is clear that they want a Tory Government led by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath)—an alternative that will not arise. They will be faced with the choice of a Conservative Government led by the present leader of the Opposition, or a Labour Government led by the present Prime Minister. I do not know whether
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
other hon. Members stood in the battle for the leadership in the Tory Party. Thev all say now that at the time they supported the right hon. Member for Sidcup.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Flint, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Davies. Is this discussion about the leadership of the Conservative Party strictly in order?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is leading up to his next point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the Tory Party to its own grief. We must recognise in discussing the economy that what will hold us in good stead for the future is our massive coal reserves.<br><br>
As a result of the policies pursued by the National Coal Board, we now have 45,000 million tons of coal which, at the present rate of consumption, will last over 300 years.<br><br>
It is a nonsense to talk about separating the Welsh area of the coal industry from the British industry. We must have a united coal industry in Britain because it was Wales that led the way to developing its coal reserves. There are difficult geological conditions, and we must now put them on a balance sheet with the rest of Britain where there are large coal reserves.<br><br>
With regard to North Sea oil and gas, in 1977 two-fifths of home demand was met by our offshore oil supplies. There are those who say that it is Shetland or Scottish oil. If that is to be the argument in Scotland, how will we in Wales enjoy the benefit of offshore oil? I believe that the offshore oil must be developed for the people of Wales, England and Scotland. One wonders where Plaid Cymru stands on the question of the development of Scottish oil only for the benefit of Scottish people.<br><br>
In our balance of payments in 1977 the oil was worth £2,900 million. It is estimated that by the mid-1980s the benefit will be £8,600 million at 1977 prices. What is important is that the development of this new resource must go into developing our industries and our community infrastructure.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to my recent Adjournment debate on the future of the coal industry in South Wales. I also raised in that debate—and I shall not develop the matter here today—the threatened closure of the Deep Duffryn colliery in Mountain Ash and the future of the phurnacite plant in Aberdare.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
Certain assurances were given in that debate by the Under-Secretary of State for Energy, and I was pleased that he was able to make the following announcement:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have the authority to say that with the agreement of the National Coal Board and the mining unions, the Government intend to put in hand a tripartite study of the South Wales coalfield … It will cover both the difficulties currently being experienced in the coalfield and the positive prospects for the future."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 20th November, 1978; Vol. 958, c. 1064.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that any pit closure will be postponed until the tripartite committee can consider all possible alternatives. I am pleased to note that the Welsh Office will be involved in these discussions. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales represents the Rhondda and is fully conversant with the problems facing the coal industry in South Wales. I think that the Rhondda Valley, more than any other area, has suffered most in the rundown of the coal industry, and there are certain problems facing the coal industry there.<br><br>
As the Committee will know a group of hon. Members—you, Mr. Davies, were among us—to meet the National Union of Mineworkers in South Wales which put forward a responsible and a reasonable case. There are, however, special geological problems facing the coalfields in South Wales. Special financial problems need to be examined. Therefore, when we find that some of the coal industries in the EEC countries have been heavily subsidised and that the British coal industry has not been subsidised to such an extent, I believe that if we are to meet our energy needs for the future we shall have to examine the financial support that we are giving.<br><br>
Ten years ago steel imports amounted to two million tons a year. Today, steel imports to Britain amount to four million tons a year. Five years ago, 25 per cent, of our cars came from abroad. At present 50 per cent, of our cars come from abroad. This is a part of the economic indicator which we must examine more closely. Last year manufactured goods made up three-fifths of our total imports. There was a time in Britain when we manufactured a great percentage of goods, having imported raw materials. Now, however, there is this movement inwards of steel, motor cars and manufactured goods. When we import cars, what we are doing is importing the steel that goes into their manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that the direct circle
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
of movement in this direction is due entirely to our entry into the EEC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has not helped matters. I hope that the Government will re-examine the need for selective import controls suggested by the Trades Union Congress. I do not believe that there should be import controls across the board, but in certain areas. As my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Evans) said, membership of the Common Market prevents us from dealing with other European countries in that regard other than with members of the Common Market. We need to encourage our people to buy British goods. If our people are increasingly buying goods produced abroad, that in itself will lead to unemployment in this country.<br><br>
In the early 1920s two out of three working people in South Wales were employed in the coal industry or in steelworks. In fact, 270,000 people in South Wales were employed in the coalmining industry. We have seen a tremendous transformation in South Wales since the 1920s. Those occupations now involve only one in six of the South Wales labour force. Increasingly in the valleys, people are employed in a variety of industries involving the consumption of energy.<br><br>
We must pay special regard to the problems of the people in the valleys of South Wales. Industrial South Wales is home to 1.8 million people. Over two-thirds of the 2.7 million inhabitants of Wales live in the South Wales area. I believe that the Government must in the months and years ahead give increasing consideration to the needs of the heads of the valley area. Recently, a group of hon. Members met the heads of the valley at a standing conference, and they intend to bring out a short term strategy for the manufacturing industry in the heads of the valley. They are specifically asking for the creation of new job opportunities within the office and service sectors.<br><br>
What we need in the valleys, which at one time were so dependent on coal and steel, is now to increase the diversity. We have within the valleys communities with their various facilities and social services. They are happy living where they are. We must make it an important policy that we take the jobs to the people in such areas rather than that they should migrate out of Wales or to the coastal belt. The Heads of the Valley standing conference has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
suggested to us that the possibility of further improving incentives should be considered rather than that the Government consider developing new towns in Wales.<br><br>
We have had the argument about Llantrisant before, but rather than talking of creating new areas of population we should try to maintain the existing happy communities and take the jobs into those areas. The question of communications has also been raised.<br><br>
We are told by the Opposition that private enterprise will solve these problems. We must examine a number of instances in Wales where private enterprise has failed the people. The most recent example is that of the firm of Triang in Merthyr. There was a firm in my constituency which was not concerned with making products or employing people but with the making of money. The asset strippers have moved into businesses in Wales as they have moved into other parts of Britain, and their sole concern is the making of money. I am talking about the Bentleys, the Slater Walkers and others who are lauded by the Opposition.<br><br>
I return to the problem which recently faced the workers in the Triang Pedigree works in Merthyr. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands) is not here but he, working wit hthe Welsh Office, has done a great deal to try to resolve the problems that faced the workers in that factory. I understand that discussions are still taking place and that they are turning to the possibility of a workers' co-operative. I do not know whether that is a viable proposition at present, but I believe that, where we have a group of workers who we know have skills and can produce a product that is required, we must look at the approaches being made.<br><br>
I understand that today the Welsh TUC is approaching both the Welsh Development Agency and the new Co-operative Development Agency to try to find a solution to the problems to enable these workers to remain to produce something which is required in the economy and will have to be imported if the factory goes out of existence.<br><br>
I believe that unemployment remains the main problem facing us in Britain at present, although I know that it is a problem which is shared by the Western world. The Secretary of State referred to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
youth opportunities programme. I disagree with the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards), who tried to pooh-pooh the whole idea. It is far better for young people to be brought into some type of work where they gain experience than to join the unemployment queue, because the problem facing the young employed is that when they go for jobs they are asked what experience they have, and if they do not have experience they cannot get the jobs. If we can develop a scheme where they can get training or continue their education this would be far better in that they would be ready for the future expansion of the economy which we want. Better that than that they should be wasting their time in the unemployment queue.<br><br>
There should be full support for the youth opportunities programme, not only from the Government but from local authorities, industrialists and trade unionists, although it is a temporary method. We must face the point made in the <i>Financial Times</i> that unemployment figures could reach two million in 1983. It could almost have given the date of 1984 and we would be in an Orwellian situation. This will not be dealt with by our existing economic system, which is why I believe that we must change the economic system.<br><br>
I suggest that the Government consider the problem not just for Wales but for the whole of Britain, and that a Royal Commission could be set up to study future employment prospects. Although we may use the temporary measures for the next year or so, we now need a study in depth by experts, because we are moving into an era where the industrial revolution of the past 100 or 200 years has led to certain changes. We now have a major, qualitative change in scientific and technological development, and we have to find methods of bringing people into full employment.<br><br>
We are in the age of the silicon chip and micro processes. I understand that next Wednesday the Government will launch a campaign to speed up the application of micro electronics in industry, with the help of £50 million in State aid and other incentives. That is a major development. The effect that it will have on future employment prospects will be tremendous. We shall not get it under the old economic system, operated by the Tories, of hire and fire. We have a new situation and we must have new Socialist policies to meet it.<br><br>
In the early days in the valleys of South Wales we used to talk about the need for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
Socialism because it was an idea that we should work for a better way of life. I believe that Socialism was argued in those days because it was possibly Utopia. Today we need to argue the case of Socialism because, under the system of private enterprise for market forces, we shall not have that civilised society. The only way in which we can meet the needs of the people and give them job opportunities in the age of the scientific changes now taking place is by developing a fully Socialist society.</span></p>
<p>12.5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for his kind remark at the outset of the debate. I am very grateful to him.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) must be living in a world of make-believe if he thinks that there is a hire-and-fire-system. This morning I received two letters complaining that a certain person who had fallen asleep on the job had been given large compensation. That is far from hire-and-fire. It is quite the opposite. I assure the hon. Gentleman that today, even when people seem to have caused considerable trouble by their own shortcomings, they are extremely hard to get rid of.<br><br>
I ask the Committee's indulgence if I concentrate rather strictly on the problems of my own constituency. In South Glamorgan and in the Vale of Glamorgan there has been a substantial loss in the steel industry in the Cardiff area. By any standards, without apportionment of political blame of any kind to anyone, this has been a savage blow to the industrial base of the county, and its effects have been felt in a wide area round about, including my constituency and the Vale of Glamorgan itself.<br><br>
I also mention to the Secretary of State the problems of TAC—formerly Turners—at Rhoose, which have become rather serious. If, as seems possible, this long-established undertaking is vacated, I hope that urgent attention will be given to the possibility of finding a new use for the premises and a new company to occupy them. The premises are invaluable.<br><br>
There is also a need to encourage major industries in the area. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is well aware of the steady achievements in the Barry area of BP Chemicals at Sully and the Dow Corning Group at Cadoxton, Barry, and,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
indeed, of the cement industry along the coast at Rhoose and Aberthaw, and of the fight back by the docks at Barry, which at one time were under a dark cloud.<br><br>
I remind the Secretary of State of the remarkably good labour relations in all the undertakings I have mentioned, and in several others, too. Indeed, my constituency has been remarkably free from industrial disputes, except those originating from national disputes which have drawn in local people. Smaller firms have difficulties, too, and several associated with smaller firms have complained to me, even last week, of the difficulties under which they labour. They have particularly mentioned some of the continuing problems arising from the Employment Protection Act. I know that recently the Government have looked more kindly at ways of improving that legislation, and I hope that they will look at it again.<br><br>
In this area there is, too, the encouraging feature of several industrial and trading estates. There is the large area along the Penarth Road, which is partly in my constituency, where there is the Llandough trading estate, the Atlantic trading estate at Barry and the Biglis estate at Cadoxton, Barry. All these deserve the utmost encouragement.<br><br>
Here I must turn to communications. Nothing, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, can be more beneficial to South Wales and to the South Wales economy than the early completion of the M4. We look forward to the day when traffic will continue unimpeded from the bridge. But I echo the anxieties expressed recently by the hon. Member for Newport (Mr. Hughes). We are concerned about the problems of the Severn crossing. The Government should look again at the system by which areas dependent on major bridge crossings of estuaries or rivers are penalised by having to pay tolls compared with those which have their motorways without tolls. It is an artificial distinction. Why should areas, because they are dependent on a bridge, have to pay these tolls and areas which have major motorways, also costing millions, be free from tolls? I could understand it if all these things were subject to tolls, but I do not accept that bridges alone should bear tolls. I hope that the Government will get rid of them. It is only right to do so. These matters have a harsh impact on the industrial economy of Wales.<br><br>
The communication from the motorway
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
to Culverhouse Cross has now been authorised and accepted. It is urgently important and will help my constituency and relieve the traffic pressure in the western part of Cardiff.<br><br>
At the earliest possible date we want a connection between Culverhouse Cross and Barry Docks with a feeder road to the airport at Rhoose. This is extremely important because of the congestion of heavy vehicular traffic which now follows a most unsuitable route through East-brook, Dinas Powis and on to Barry. This is now damaging the amenities and normal living conditions of all the people living in dwellings abutting this route. Heavy vehicles have to use quite unsuitable residential streets through Barry. This is a major problem for those who live in that part of my constituency.<br><br>
I had wished to be brief this morning, but I cannot allow the sitting to pass without referring to the Cardiff-Wales airport about which I have had to speak on previous occasions. As the Secretary of State knows, civil aviation in Wales has had little or no financial help compared with Scotland, Ireland and England. Civil aviation in Wales has come, despite the actions of the central Government. I believe that more must be done by the Government to assist and encourage civil aviation in Wales, particularly the airport at Rhoose.<br><br>
We are now faced with the continued rate burden which the Government have refused to mitigate, and there are great fears in my constituency among the many people employed there. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is aware that the number of people employed at the airport is now quite large, and the fear among those servicing the aircraft is that there is likely to be a gradual or complete withdrawal by British Airways from the airport. This is a serious matter to the locality and to civil aviation in Wales.<br><br>
It was a bad day for Wales when Cambrian Airways was taken over by British Airways. Cambrian Airways was Cardiff-based, South Wales-based, with a Welsh outlook, which did excellent work and was growing steadily. But British Airways, for reasons of its own, absorbed it gradually, first taking a minority interest and then taking it over completely. It has so far continued servicing some of the aircraft at Rhoose, where it employed a lot of people, but I have had evidence that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
it seems likely to withdraw in the near future, and I hope that the Secretary of State will fight against this with his Cabinet colleagues.<br><br>
We are also disturbed at what is happening about bookings since British Airways has become prominent there. Formerly the bookings, through Cambrian Airways, were made at Cardiff. Travel agents say that they want to have flights from Rhoose but the person replying on the telephone is based in London and in some cases does not even know where Rhoose is. It is an absurd situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disturbed to hear the hon. Gentleman speak of evidence. As he is aware—I do not detract one jot from his personal efforts—Welsh members were unanimous in supporting the establishment of a proper civil air authority in Wales. If there is evidence that it is being run down—I have had no documentation from the authoritative sources concerned—the unity of Welsh Members will be called in aid to ensure that that does not happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had an authoritative document, but fears have been expressed to me by the employees, some of them well informed about matters relating to civil aviation. There is also the fact that the attempts, even by travel agents, to place flights out of Rhoose are made difficult by the way in which British Airways manages its affairs.<br><br>
Again, there is the recent refusal by all connected with the appropriate Departments—the Treasury and so on—to permit duty-free facilities at Rhoose. Duty-free facilities are available in Northern Ireland. They are available in no fewer than four airports in Scotland, and, of course, several airports in England. It is diabolical that the only decent airport available to people in Wales is still deprived of those facilities. I have written not only to the Minister responsible for airports but also, as he knows, to the Secretary of State himself asking him to intervene in the matter. He is responsible, broadly, for the whole of Welsh affairs, and I hope that he will fight this battle for our airport.<br><br>
I have tried to be brief. I feel that the Secretary of State has, naturally, concentrated on those features which he thinks will give a brighter picture of the Welsh economy. I hope that he is right and that there will be an upturn in our affairs. I hope that the upturn will extend to our

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
manufacturing industries throughout both Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
But the fact remains, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) pointed out, that much of the recent improvement has been based not on the achievements of manufacturing industry but on the improvement in our balance of payments due to the providential accident of the discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil. We must look to the future for the improvement of our industry. It will not be easy. Our productivity is still abysmally poor compared with that of our chief trading rivals. Nothing I see can alter that other than a change in determination throughout the United Kingdom as well as in the Principality.<br><br>
I do not blame the right hon. and learned Gentleman for trying the paint the best picture he can of our economy, but it would be folly for us to imagine that the road ahead is broad and sure and that everything is bright. I think that this country—I speak of the United Kingdom as a whole—has to endure some of the difficulties which are inherent in our present situation before we can take a really decisive turn for the better.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both Front Bench spokesmen started on the right foot in putting our Welsh economy in the context of the United Kingdom economy as a whole. Indeed, it is a somewhat artificial concept to talk of the Welsh economy, so dependent are we on the health of the United Kingdom economy. The extent to which that is so and the extent to which we depend on outside factors, such as the total world economy, business confidence, investment intentions and the size of the public sector, show the absurdity of the search for political independence in the light of this common market within the United Kingdom.<br><br>
That said, there are clearly emphases within Wales which are different for us because of our industrial structure, because of our industrial and social history and because of our topography. Perhaps the basic point is that it is more true for us in Wales than elsewhere in the United Kingdom that there is a need now to create more jobs at a time when, for a variety of reasons, it is increasingly difficult so to do. It is more difficult because of the low growth in the total
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
world economy, because, for technical reasons relating to multinationals, there is a consolidation which leads to less expansion, and also because we in Wales are suffering more than in past decades from competition from other areas such as the West Midlands. There is an apparent conflict between regional policy and the Government's inner city policy, which does not affect us in Wales to the same extent save in certain parts of Cardiff, Swansea and parts of Rhondda—the "valley city" which extends over that area.<br><br>
The increased competition within the United Kingdom leads to a blunting of many of the regional incentives which we have relied on in the past. I am thinking of the regional employment premium, the new role of the Location of Offices Bureau and the relaxations on office permits, which in their various ways are likely to affect Wales adversely.<br><br>
I remark in passing that I was amused by the part of the speech of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) on regional polic ywhere he tried to reconcile the speech of his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) and remarks which he himself has made in various parts of Wales. There appears to be a growth area among Tory Front Bench spokesmen at the moment—one hon. Member makes one speech, another makes another speech, and then there is an attempt at reconciliation to qualify what one speaker has said. It happens in pay policy and now we find it in regional policy. No doubt, we shall find—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a letter from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), who saw my speech before I delivered it in Cardigan and who writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"As you can imagine, the entire flavour of my unscripted remarks at the press conference was to the same effect, accompanied by emphatic explanation of the point that you are making."</p></blockquote>
There is no disagreement between us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) been speaking in Pembroke or Carmarthen, he might well have made the same speech, but Tory Front Bench spokesmen forget that we have a communications industry which conveys to all parts of the country speeches which people make. Therefore, happily, we are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
able to hear and understand what other Front Bench spokesmen say in Birmingham or wherever it may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree such a dichotomy between one person and another has not been unknown in the Labour Party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are teaching others. But at the moment in the Conservative Party it is done with a particular dedication over a whole range of policies—pay policy and now regional policy—whereas, although in the past we may have been able to teach other hon. Members, certainly our Front Bench spokesmen have a degree of harmony and unity which has not prevailed for many a long day among Government spokesmen.<br><br>
Having said that and having stressed the difficulty of finding jobs—and having been sidetracked by interventions—I turn to the other side of the coin, the need to create more jobs. I shall not deal with coal because my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) has dealt with that topic very effectively both today and in his recent Adjournment debate.<br><br>
The chairman of the British Steel Corporation, Sir Charles Villiers, suggested in a recent speech that there was no longer any expectation of expansion in our steel industry and that the last two years, which had been characterised by many as a period of retrenchment—a trough of recession—were now to be regarded as the norm in the British steel industry. We know to what extent our own major steel producers in Llanwern and Port Talbot depend on the health of, for example, the United Kingdom car and domestic appliance industries. But, according to the chairman, even if there were to be a marginal expansion in total United Kingdom steel demand, that expansion would be unlikely to have a significant effect on production in the United Kingdom because of the new competition from the Koreas and the Taiwans—from the areas which have caught us up in steel technology and which, because of their labour costs and the scale of their production, are able to compete with us very effectively indeed. We know that, against these new competitors from the Japans and the Koreas, our own manpower productivity and labour costs put us at a substantial disadvantage.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
In Wales, all sectors look to the Government. The latest projections suggest that on the likely public sector borrowing requirement, for as long ahead as one can reasonably see, Government expenditure will be restrained and therefore we cannot expect much assistance from that quarter, where there will be tight control.<br><br>
In this context, what is the job of Government? It is a necessary, but somewhat limited job. The Government must identify problems, remove obstacles to expansion and provide incentives.<br><br>
I congratulate my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State on the success of the first four years of his tenure of office in terms of providing a new structure for industrial expansion within Wales—the success of both the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. In institutional terms we have succeeded over the years in establishing these new instruments for industrial expansion in Wales.<br><br>
Having said that, I commend to my right hon. and learned Friend a new and exciting theme which will meet a real need in Wales. This is increasing concern for our environment. One of the happiest features of recent years in Wales has been the extent to which groups in the Principality can be mobilised on general environmental questions. This is particularly apparent on the industrial front. In the past, people would have welcomed industry simply for the sake of jobs, whatever might be the environmental disadvantages accompanying it. But now people all over Wales are waking up to the importance of the environment. This concern has a number of offshoots.<br><br>
The point about marginal land was made from the Opposition Benches opposite, and my hon. Friends share the concern about that. There is concern about the extent to which productive agricultural land is being swallowed up apace in Wales and the need, therefore, for house building programmes to take account of inner city areas and derelict areas. New controls on industrial expansion are needed. There should be a reconsideration of the waste disposal policies of our local authorities, spearheaded by the Welsh Office, trying to ensure that the least adverse environmental impact is made by that service.<br><br>
I give the Government considerable credit for the extent to which our communications in Wales have been improved over the past year, both with other nations and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
external markets and within the internal market in Wales.<br><br>
I simply itemise these points which have already been made because they are of vital importance. There is the question of the basic road network, the M4, which is a significant personal tribute to my right hon. and learned Friend and is now almost complete in South Wales. On rail there is the high-speed train, which shortens distances and makes areas of Wales, which, in the past, seemed so far in perspective terms, now within easy reach of businessmen in the South-East of England.<br><br>
I note some new possible threats to our rail network. It was stated in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 16th November that:
<br><blockquote><p>"British Rail has revived the idea of closing substantial sectors of its loss-making rural services and replacing them with buses."</p></blockquote>
Services regarded as suitable include the central Wales line and the commuter areas around Cardiff. I trust that the Secretary of State is aware of the rumours and will endeavour to ensure that the Welsh case is put strongly if these matters get through to Government level.<br><br>
It is also true, of course, that our rolling stock is still very antiquated on these routes, and I hope that the fact that there is no electrification on rails in the Welsh area will be a stimulus to us to ensure that we get a portion of that new investment.<br><br>
We look to the Government to remove obstacles to industrial expansion. One of these is clearly the planning structure in local government, currently the two-tier structure, which so often acts as an obstacle, or delaying device,|when businessmen frequently need to have speedy decisions. One thinks, too, of the multiplicity of access points for information—a point made recently by a Commons Committee.<br><br>
On the incentive side, the Welsh Development Agency is a success story. In many ways it has established itself now as a permanent part of the Welsh incentives landscape and has proved most flexible, as I found recently in points I made to it about the problem of small businesses in my own area which were cleared from the inner city as a result of urban renewal schemes.<br><br>
Perhaps the point one can make about the WDA is that it has now consolidated itself and has become accepted. But there is increasingly a view in Wales that the WDA is becoming over-cautious and that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
there needs to be a greater willingness to risk.<br><br>
The driver and vehicle licensing centre is being looked at closely by my right hon. and learned Friend, not only in its effect on rural Wales but in view of the projected job loss in our areas.<br><br>
Ports traditionally in South Wales have been at the centre of our economic activity although, of course, rather less so recently as a result of other modes of transport developing. They could still have a major role but now a subsidised rival is threatening the possibility of their doing so.<br><br>
I do not want to revive the rather sterile arguments we had in the late 1960s of rivalry on both sides of the Bristol Channel. But one principle we should begin with is that, irrespective of the ownership, be it public or private, the ground rules should be the same for enterprises involved in the same industry.<br><br>
It is absurd that now we have two publicly-owned enterprises in the same industry but with different operational constraints—the British Transport Docks Board ports in South Wales and the Bristol West Dock. Whereas our own BTDB ports have to make a profit by statute and did—indeed, the South Wales ports as a group contributed about £7.1 million to the total BTDB profit in 1977—the port of Bristol authority, according to its last accounts, made a deficit of rather more than £3.3 million, £2.1 million of which was a contribution from the city council from the general rate fund. It appears quite wrong that there should be rate subsidy for the Bristol west port and in an area of general cargoes which is threatening our own ports. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will look at this anomaly and protect our South Wales ports.<br><br>
There is much going right for Wales in a period of general recession. Our unemployment levels have moved nearer to the national average; we have a resilient work force and excellent communications. AU of this has allowed us to weather the economic storms better than many would have anticipated five years ago.</span></p>
<p>Several hon. Members <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Many hon. Members have indicated their desire to catch my eye in this morning's session, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
I regret that it will not be possible to satisfy everyone due to the length of the speeches. I make the appeal that I could possibly catch the eye of two members before we adjourn.</span></p>
<p>13.36 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarvon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best, Mr. Davies, to fit in with your suggestion.<br><br>
The tenor of this debate seems to be all wrong. There seems to have been an acceptance—a resignation—mixed with complacency and self-congratulation about the situation of the economy in Wales. I find this disturbing. We should be making our voices heard about the dissatisfaction we feel in the situation as it exists. Albeit steps have been taken and improvements made over the past two or three years, the situation remains that we have now 89,000 unemployed in Wales with only 8,500 empty jobs—10 people unemployed chasing every job that is available. Six of the 14 employment exchanges in the United Kingdom that have an unemployment rate in excess of 13 per cent, are to be found in Wales.<br><br>
I have the feeling that I have heard this debate before and I look back to <i>Hansard</i> of 21st January 1976 and see that that is the case and that the same point was put forward to a large extent at that time. I quote briefly from what was said at that time and consider it in the context of our present situation. The Secretary of State for Wales said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am confident that we are now planning and preparing for the future, and we are taking every possible step to ensure that the Welsh economy flourishes and prospers." [<i>Official Report, Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 21st January 1976, c. 98.]</p></blockquote>
Two years later, there is not much sign of that happening. The Under-Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I urge the Committee not to ignore the good signs which are appearing on the horizon—inflation down, prices under better control, a pay policy that is working, a trade deficit that has improved dramatically. These are signs that have appears as a result of Government policies." [<i>Official Report, Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 21st January 1976, c. 10]</p></blockquote>
But we still have 89,000 people unemployed and it has been up to over 100,000 this summer. It is not good enough. Let us look in detail at some of the problems that are facing us. I welcome the news that there are to be additional funds for the Welsh Development Agency, referred to in the Queen's Speech. I think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
we should all like confirmation that the sum is to be £50 million and that it is to be available very soon. More important even than that, I hope that there will be pressure on the Welsh Development Agency to use the money in a constructive way and use it quickly when there is such a need for initiative in terms of creating jobs.<br><br>
I welcome, too, the small firms employment subsidy and hope that this is an indication of taking down the artificial barrier that exists in many instances between the productive sector and the service sector of the economy. I despair that there is no sign of a commitment to regional policy reappearing, no replacement for the regional employment premium that was taken away. The problems have grown largely as a result of that.<br><br>
There are three or four specific instances of failure in the Government sector that is leading to a worsening of the economic position and the employment position. I give examples in the manufacturing sector and I take them from my own constituency and elsewhere.<br><br>
I refer the Secretary of State to the problems facing a company in Caernarvon—Bernard Wardle. It is a company that has run down from 800 employees to about 320 after the latest redundancy of 70 announced recently. This company has bought up a factory in Manchester, which is manufacturing some of the goods that could be made in Caernarvon. The employees are very worried that jobs are being transferred from Caernarvon to Manchester. They are convinced that the company could be rebuilt, that the market for PVC does exist and that, if the imports of dumped PVC could be restricted, a future for the Caernarvon factory could be secured and jobs made certain for these people who so much need them. I have taken the matter up with the Welsh Development Agency. It is sympathetic, but so far there is no apparent action and another 70 jobs have gone.<br><br>
Another company in my constituency is Barton Motors, a small company making motor cycle components. It had to reduce its labour force—it is a small company—from seven to five, a loss of only two jobs. But it is a company that has been going for only two years and looks like being very successful. The proprietor drew my attention the great burden placed on it by the conditions of assistance imposed by the Welsh Development Agency. The building
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
has a loan of £7,500, but the interest rate for that—16⅔ per cent.—was crippling and required a repayment of £1,700 in the first year only, the time when the liquidity of such a company is under strain.<br><br>
I know that provisions in the Welsh Development Agency Act require that interest is charged on a competitive basis, but I suggest to the Government that the time has come to review the Act so that companies in this position can get greater assistance.<br><br>
After all, plenty of commercial loans are available in the open market, and the WDA should be coming into an area where such provision is not available. I hope very much that this matter can be looked at.<br><br>
This company also suggested to the Welsh Development Agency that it take up some of the equity of the company and sell it back to the company later. It did so in the knowledge that the WDA had stated in the strategy published earlier this year—I quote from page 8:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Welsh Development Agency will through its Small Business Unit encourage the establishment of new manufacturing businesses, no matter how small, whether to serve local or wider markets. Many of these new businesses inevitably entail a high degree of risk which private financial institutions are reluctant to bear. The WDA has a special role in this field. It will be prepared to take a significant share of the risk in promising ventures by injecting both equity and loan finance."</p></blockquote>
But in this instance it did not and, as a result, jobs will be lost. Possibly the whole thing will be lost. It is under possible takeover bids from a company in Bolton and another in Milton Keynes. Apparently there are better incentives in those places. This is not good enough.<br><br>
A third instance, again in my constituency and where the Welsh Development Agency is again involved, is Inn Fare Foods at Pwllheli, a company which applied for a factory in May 1977. It wanted a factory to make frozen foods; it wanted to develop jobs. It had a very good reputation in the limited production from its existing facility, which was attached to a restaurant. By September 1978 there was still no sign of a factory for the company. There were promises, promises, but not a single brick laid. Surely in 15 months a small 5,000 sq. ft. purpose-built factory could have been constructed for this company. As a result, it is going to Cheshire to get its facility. This is not good enough and it must be improved.<br><br>
Yet again in Pwllheli there is a company
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
called Gwalia Food Products. Mr. Bernard, the proprietor, set it up to manufacture continental confectionery. He had an expert from the Continent to train his own people for a limited period of time. That expert was a Polish citizen and he was sent back. Mr Bernard was assured that alternative employees would be available in the United Kingdom. The Department of Employment has failed to come forward with a suitable man and, as a result, two people have lost their jobs already and five or seven jobs could be lost in total. Orders with companies such as Tesco and Butlin and with major manufacturers in Birmingham are in danger of being lost as a result.<br><br>
All these companies are in the public sector. They all have a public sector involvement. Surely one special key worker could have been allowed in from Poland to train the local people in Wales in that sort of circumstance.<br><br>
I come to the instance raised by the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans)—Triang in Merthyr. It is an area which I know well, having had many Triang employees as constituents in my ward in Merthyr when I was on the old Merthyr borough council. This factory is in great danger of losing 340 jobs. As the hon. Member for Aberdare said, it is an example of a company crippled by the worst aspects of the ugly face of capitalism, the asset stripping that took place under John Bentley and his associates, and the company has not got over that.<br><br>
I would have hoped that, in the type of industrial structure that the WDA was supposed to be involved with, it would have been possible for the public sector to intervene where the private sector had made such a mess, and intervene with the long-term objective of keeping these jobs in existence and not with that of a rundown at the end of the day, whether that day comes after a general election or before. I understand that about £1 million of public money had gone into this company since the receiver moved in. Surely it would have been better if £1 million of equity from the WDA had gone in, for at least that would have given confidence to the customers of the company, particularly the catalogue companies which need a continuing time-scale before they will order the goods.<br><br>
The point is that the goods made by this company have a high reputation, such as Pedigree Prams—we know about them. As the hon. Member for Aberdare said, this sector will have imports that will take over
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
if we cannot manufacture the goods ourselves.<br><br>
There are new potential orders for this company—the pram fair at Harrogate recently showed that—and orders from Tesco, Mothercare and Littlewoods are available. Now I understand that the loss should be cut to £400,000 next year. I put it to the Secretary of State that it is cheaper to pay £400,000 in helping this company to keep going, or to inject more than that in terms of additional equity, than to be paying the £320 per man per month which I was told in a Parliamentary Answer this week it costs on average per man out of work—and which amounts to £1.3 million per year for 340 people on average. Surely it is more reasonable to keep these men in work than to run down the company, and I hope that the meeting between the TUC and WDA brings forward a formula to keep it going. But if it does not, I would press the Secretary of State to give a directive section 1 (9) of the WDA Act for the WDA to take over this company to run it as a wholly-owned subsidiary or, better still, as a co-operative, if that can be set up.<br><br>
While we are in the heads of the valley area, the unemployment situation there could be even more serious if the impact of imported washing machines has an effect on the Hoover company at Merthyr in the same was as it is rumoured to be having an effect on the Hotpoint company at Llandudno Junction. There is very grave cause for concern that cheap products are coming in, resulting in the loss of jobs for people in Wales.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower) referred to air communications and the need to step them up in Wales. He said that we are the poor relations in terms of air communications, and that is certainly so, and I appeal to the Secretary of State to give his blessing to the proposals that have been put to him for an around-Wales airbus service, linking Cardiff and Hawarden—a link that already exists—but also Caernarvon and Haverfordwest and Swansea to Cardiff, at a very reasonable cost by a company that has done very good pioneering work. It is a possibility for next year, and I hope the Secretary of State can give some indication on this.<br><br>
Other Members have referred to the situation in rural Wales the dangers of existing policy leading to increased unem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
ployment. This is a real worry, and if petrol prices go up by another 20p per gallon—as is a possibility—it will be a death blow to many parts of rural Wales that are totally dependent of the car for transport. Bus services have been axed, the trains have gone and we do not have the sort of facilities for public transport that exist in the cities such as London. This trend must be reversed. It does not help very much when we see the sort of change in the rate support structure announced last week, whereby there is a cut-back, an 11 per cent, reduction, in the latest settlement for Gwynedd for 1979–80 compared with 1974–75—and that is in real terms, after taking into account inflation.<br><br>
Another aspect where I have been underlining Government involvement in the unemployment and the run down of the Welsh economy is the underspending in the last finnacial year by public authorities in Wales of money that was available under cash limits that the Government had imposed—a total of £57 million on three items, roads, housing and water services. If this money is available, for goodness sake let us spend it. The sum of £57, million is equivalent to 10,000 jobs, and we could do with an extra 10,000 jobs in Wales at present.<br><br>
The point I wish to press is that despite the steps taken by the Government through the employment schemes the problem remains chronic. The employment schemes, good though they be, have only scratched the surface of the problem. I did not hear a reference today to the special temporary employment programme. No wonder! The latest number of people in Wales employed under the programme is a grand total of 111—when there are 89,000 unemployed. This is not good enough, yet the work is there to be done all around us in Wales. What of the houses which need to be built? There are 60,000 families on the waiting lists for council houses, and 100,000 houses are not up to standard. What of the improvements which are needed to our roads, both east-west and north-south, particularly in the valley areas? What of the mess that needs to be cleared up in the environment? The Prime Minister need only look at his own constituency, at the present mess in Bute Town—my goodness, there is work all around us which needs to be done. There are people who want to do this work and yet we do not have the wit to bring them and the work together to solve the problem.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
This is a problem for the Government and one they have so far failed to solve. I press the Secretary of State to look again for new initiatives in manpower planning so that we can get an answer to this problem and not to let our environment and facilities decline while our unemployment goes up and the whole economy of Wales suffers as a result.</span></p>
<p>12.50 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Flint, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government help announced for the tourist industry in Wales, particularly in the North Wales coast region, which is excluded from the development area. I congratulate the right hon. and learned Gentleman on taking this step, which he will acknowledge my hon. Friends and I have pressed hard for.<br><br>
I hope that in due course the Government will go on to give the hotel industry the same kind of depreciation allowances which, as was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards), pretty well every other EEC country now gives. In some countries these allowances range up to 10 per cent, and in the Netherlands it is 12 per cent, per annum for the first two years. As has been said, the Welsh hotel industry badly needs renewal, nowhere more so than in my constituency. Therefore, the help which has been announced, although very welcome, is still not what we hoped for.<br><br>
Whilst on this subject, the Government could give further help to the tourist industry in general, at no cost to public funds, by tidying up the licensing laws and still more by eliminating the absurd anomalies over Sunday opening, whereby reluctant councils are obliged to prosecute perfectly respectable traders who open for business on more than the stipulated number of Sundays per month but which are totally helpless when they try to act against fly-by-night traders who set up their stalls of flashy wares on a piece of waste ground and are up and off before they can be prosecuted.<br><br>
There has been a good deal of discussion in the Committee about regional policy. Surely it is foolish to be too dogmatic about this. If market forces are given free rein, certain parts of the country such as Wales will fall into decay and there will be gross congestion in other parts. Human beings are not mere instruments of production to be moved around with every swing of the economic pendulum. Of course
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
there is a role for central Government, for local government and their agencies in steering development to the regions.<br><br>
I am particularly pleased with the number of new jobs—as many as 1,000, I am told—which have been brought to the borough of Delyn by its energetic industrial development committee working in harmonious partnership with Clwyd county council and the Welsh Development Agency. This reflects great credit on all concerned, and I hope that we will shortly see equally helpful developments in the borough of Rhuddlan.<br><br>
The development policy costs money, and that money has to be found from industry outside the assisted areas and ray right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe) was doing no more than pointing out this awkward but inescapable fact. How far is it right to lay burdens on industry in the rest of the country in order to provide help for industry in the regions? This must be a matter of judgment.<br><br>
Certainly, the tax burden placed on industry in central and south-east England is such as gravely to handicap the economic expansion of the United Kingdom as a whole, for the reasons pointed out by the Secretary of State himself. Clearly, that will not be of any help to Wales. Wales cannot prosper if England is poor. I repeat that this is a matter of judgment, but what is beyond dispute is that a policy which in the name of regional development deliberately sets out to hold back economic expansion in the rest of the United Kingdom is both foolish and wicked.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East was also right in saying that the best value for money in regional policy is direct Government investment, most particularly in roads—I welcome what the right hon. and learned Gentleman had to say and urge him to go faster—and also in pressing on with new investment in State-owned industry, such as the steel industry. I must say that the Government's regional policy for Wales will not be entirely credible until they have made clear their intention about investment in the steel plant at Port Talbot and Shotton. They cannot allow damaging uncertainty to go on any longer.<br><br>
But if the Welsh economy means employment—as it surely does to most of us—the Government and their Conservative successors, who will be taking office next year, must reckon with the certainty

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
that manufacturing and extractive industry, whether public or private, will not be able to provide enough jobs in view of the technological changes which are about to overwhelm us. The only hope of keeping the people of Wales happily employed lies in a vast expansion of service industries, in the number of self-employed and most especially in agriculture.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke said, there is no doubt that, with the right incentives, some of which are available from the EEC, more marginal land in Wales could be brought back into production. That would not only provide jobs, but would actually improve the environment which, as the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) said, is more than one can say for a lot of other industry.<br><br>
The Government ought also to think very carefully—much more carefully than they have done up to date—about the consequences of the increase in petrol tax on the chances of getting more jobs in the countryside. The right hon. and learned Gentleman should argue with all his power in Cabinet against this townee proposal.<br><br>
The Welsh economy is an inseparable part of the United Kingdom economy. The chances of expanding the economy of the United Kingdom, whether we are in or out of the European monetary system, depends largely on the ability of the Government to maintain a rate of inflation in the United Kingdom no higher than that of our competitors. The Government's chosen strategy for containing inflation relies largely on wage restraint. Wage restraint will come under severe pressure in the coming months from unions seeking a rise as large as or larger than that won by the Ford workers. The Government have said that they will not yield to strikes in support of excessive wage claims, even strikes in essential services. Unless they intend people to freeze to death, or be starved, or be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
poisoned by sewage they must intend to keep these essential services going even in the face of a strike.<br><br>
How can that be done? The troops cannot cope. The Government will need the help of volunteers. I do not mean vigilantes or Colonel Stirling's men. I mean the workers in the industries concerned who would put the safety of the public before their wage claims, however well justified. What protection will the Government give these volunteers? If they do give assurances, what response will they get? I can tell them what response they will get in my constituency. Seven brave men who put their duty to save lives before the demand of the union have had their lives shattered by systematic petty persecution. The Clwyd fire authority has been culpably weak in not protecting these men from victimisation.<br><br>
But what have Ministers, whose dual task it is to enforce pay policy and to protect the public, done to save these seven men of Rhyl from the consequences of their devotion to duty? When the day comes to call for volunteers to the essential services in North Wales, I suspect that everyone will take two paces backwards. Is it thus that the Government hope to win public support for their economic strategy? The strategy is one which most of us support. The policy of wage restraint is one which many of us support, but the mentality of the Government in approaching this problem is economically ineffective, politically inept and, above all, morally disreputable.</span></p>
