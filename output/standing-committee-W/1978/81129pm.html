	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr, Edwards) attempting—I deliberately say "attempting"—to answer the Secretary of State for Wales this morning, I might have thought that he was naive except that I know that the hon. Gentleman is anything but that. But at no point in his speech did he make a single reference to any achievement in the economy in Wales. He spoke as though he expected the Secretary of State to come here and say in a sorrowful voice "Mea culpa—I have done nothing right". The truth, as we all know, is that there have been substantial achievements in the Welsh scene during the past few years. That does not mean to say, however, that we absolve people from blame. We know the serious problems that face Wales. We are all determined to overcome them and we all expect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon, Members that the reading of newspapers in the Committee is not permitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all expect the Secretary of State for Wales to play his full part in seeing that our aims are achieved and in giving the necessary leadership. When, therefore, we on the Government Benches are critical, and sometimes deeply critical, our criticism stems from the knowledge that the instrument is there if only we are able to persuade that instrument to do the job for which it was created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was naive also in trying to buttress a feeble argument by throwing at it masses of statistics from Treasury figures, as though everyone in the House did not know the history of mistakes, sometimes catastrophic mistakes, of that body and of the people who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
have placed their faith in trying to interpret some of its conclusions and decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member ended his attack by quoting the article by the so-called economist-journalist Nicholas Davenport, which began with a faulty premise and then built on that premise a long list of assumptions of what could happen. This, if I remember correctly, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) described as "These are the facts". If Mr. Nicholas Davenport is so sure that these are facts, I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his usual generosity of spirit, would willingly move over to let Mr Davenport see what he could do about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, and always has been since the industrial revolution, an imbalance in the economy in Britain. That imbalance is reflected in the regions of Britain. It so happens that tragically, Wales reflects that imbalance far more deeply than do most other regions. Hon. Members who said that only with a regeneration of the total economy of the United Kingdom can we hope for brighter things in Wales were correct. That is the key factor. But we have in Wales the same imbalance. It is in this sphere that we expect the Secretary, of State for Wales to take positive action, and try to help us to create the kind of society in Wales that we all across these Benches wish for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the various tragic episodes of today the increase in unemployment and the decrease of employment opportunities, was pointed out, with 80 people chasing each notified available job. For youth employment the figure is even higher and is likely to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looming on the horizon, are technological developments which, if. not carefully guided, will affect the total economy, and the economy in Wales very deeply, indeed. We are faced with developments' such as the discovery, and. now the imminent development, of the microchip, which is bound to lead to a massive displacement of labour throughout, our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, as well as the present problems—and some of them I would agree are now pretty well endemic in the Welsh economy —we are faced with another set of problems which will overlie the old ones.That was recognised by my hon. Friend, the. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans), who spoke of our making ah attempt to alter the economy in some drastic ways. I "shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
have a little more to say about that later, because it seemed to me that his contribution did not include radical enough approaches to changing the economy in order to absorb the effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As so much attention was paid to these matters this morning, I shall refer to some problems that are besetting my own area at the moment and which, perhaps, are indicative of problems which are raising their heads in far too many parts of our country today. The area which I represent has the ignominious position in the 14 travel-to-work areas in Wales of all too often being in the top three or four for unemployment, and there have been two occasions on which one of the travel-to-work areas in my locality had the top unemployment figure in Great Britain— not just in Wales. That is a problem that all of us in the locality have had to live with for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It came as a deep shock a couple of months ago, when industry after industry was collapsing, to find that with closures and threatened closures in the Rhymney valley 1,000 jobs were threatened in the space of, perhaps, a fortnight. I know that to all who are unemployed—it has been said often enough in this room—there is no percentage. For the unemployed person, it is 100 per cent. But leaving aside all the other factors of the Welsh heritage of culture and language and many other factors and looking at it only from a population point of view, I argue that there is a relativity about unemployment which means that the loss of two, three or half a dozen jobs in some parts of Wales, in rural areas, would also be looked upon as catastrophic, but in that part of Wales in Glamorgan and Gwent in South Wales where 1.8 per cent, of the population live, the density of population is such that a figure of just 2 per cent, unemployment has a tremendous impact on families and on the services around them, with, in addition, the creeping effects cutting off consumer production, reducing the productive capacity of the area and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take a classic example, there is in my constituency a coking works which produces what is probably—if one can so term it—the Rolls-Royce of cokes which is known from Scotland to Land's End. It employs over 300 men. It has always made a profit. In fact, it is the only part of the National Coal Board that every year since nationalisation has made a profit. It was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
hived off under the Administration which the hon. Member for Pembroke supports and it began to make a loss. It has made a loss this year. It will probably make a loss next year. But, immediately, the decision was reached that this was an uneconomic works and must therefore close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those magnificent intellects who sit in their splendid isolation in palatial offices forgot some of the repercussions of decisions such as that. They forgot, for example, the tragic fact—these figures were given in answer to my Questions only 10 days or so ago—that this country imports 3 million tons of coking coal per annum instead of using indigenous resources. Indeed, although the figure is small, we are importing finished coke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pundits forgot that in the centre of a coalfield there is one colliery where, out of five day's production, this works absorbs two day's production. There is a second colliery where, because of geological, water and tipping space problems, production is down to 1,300 tons per week but that coking works absorbs 700 tons per week. There is another colliery nearby where the situation is much the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the effect of closing the coking works would almost certainly be to close one colliery, to place under another colliery which could be pretty prosperous on the jeopardy list, and to leave a big question mark over the third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we should end with all coking works centralised in the north of England, with nothing in Wales and nothing in the Midlands. One of the excuses given is the downturn in the steel market. If there is picking up of that market, it is not difficult to foresee what will happen. This country will demand coke, there will be no coke, and coke will be imported, in particular from Western Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect needs to be gone into at Government level, and I suggest to the Secretary of State for Wales that he take a lead here. A brief reference was made this morning to the way in which EEC countries are massively subsidising many of their industries. We know all about the regulations against dumping, against subsidies and so on, but there are ways of circumventing these. Indeed, the old story is true that there are many people holding down highly paid jobs to discover ways of circumventing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This coking works had secured an export order for 10,000 tons, and a very favour-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
able market in Detroit. It was well on the way to securing a permanent outlet, because a further sample had been asked for, the sample this time being 100,000 tons. The negotiations were nearing completion and the finality of signature on the contract was not far away, and then West Germany stepped in and undercut the offer by £4 per ton, so the contract was lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, no Government have made a study across the board of what goes on and assessed the results. We find that in West Germany the cost of production per ton of coal is £40. The cost of production per ton of coal in Britain is £22. The investment by the British Government in the National Coal Board is about £75 million a year. The investment by the West German Government is £2,500 million per year. It is not difficult to see the pattern. There is an understanding that the mining industry will produce coal at £40 per ton, but the prices charged to people who make coke are reasonable, the people who sell coke to the steel manufacture charge reasonable prices, the manufacturing industries receive raw materials at reasonable prices, and we end by importing the cars and manufactured goods into Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing any case for protectionism. I am simply stating what one can easily see is happening. Unless we are extremely careful, the manufacturing base of Britain will be weakened to an almost non-existent level, and our industries will be little else but service industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may seem a far cry from Wales, but in the past these heavy industries have been the basic industries of Wales, and coal still remains so to a large extent. Unless we take steps in Wales to make these things clear, we shall fail in our duty to the Welsh people. As someone who is not a nationalist but who is a fervent Welshman, I am sure that all hon. Members across these Benches share my feeling that we must do our best to see that our people become conscious of these movements in economics and history which can so gravely affect their future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say a word now about the heritage of the past and what we try to do about it. Because of our dependence upon a couple of heavy industries we have in the past spent much time saying that we must diversify within Wales. But at present it appears that all we have done is diversify in order to close industries once we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
diversified. It seems to have been purely an academic exercise. Far too many of the incoming industries, at the first breath of contrary wind, run home to their mothers—the parent companies—or fold up altogether. In my own constituency this has happened time and again. There is no enduring quality about these enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hoped that the Welsh Development Agency may in time see that the pattern is changed, but in the meantime we need in Wales facilities for training people to a high level in the arts of industrial management and industrial administration so that we have our own key workers. The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) referred to the refusal of a key worker from Poland and the folding up of an industry in his constituency because the key worker was not provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a massive resource of talent and intellectual power among Welsh people to provide all the management skills and all the administrative skills that are needed if we have the proper approach to the question. It is not an insoluble problem by any means. It is comparatively easy if we have the will to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point that I make—there are many others I should like to deal with on this problem, which is such a trying one for all our constituencies—relates to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare when he said that the only way in which we shall reach any solution to this problem is to change the economy. One does not change an economy by sitting down and saying "I wish things would change". I have just come from the third meeting I have had with the Triang toy people in Merthyr, and only a week ago at a conference here in this building of the Heads of the Valleys standing conference we had them there, too, giving their story. It is a story of tragic misconception, of bureaucratic decisions which have thrown money away, and will throw it away again, as was rightly pointed out by the hon. Member for Caernarvon, because no study has been made right across the board of the impact of closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some economists it is enough to say that something is not profit making and that is the end of the story. But when we take into account the total cost of redundancy payments, where they are applicable, the cost of social benefits and unemployment benefits, the further costs—these are only money costs I am talking about— of support for children in a family and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
loss in service industries, right down to the buses which take workmen to work—when we add all that up, in nearly every case that I have looked at the total of what is being lost is astronomically greater than the alleged amount saved by a closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, of course, one has the deep human suffering, the feeling of inadequacy, particularly the feeling that one is no longer a contributing and constructive member of society. That feeling comes from many years of conditioning to what may be the wrong attitude to work. I do not know. I do not know whether work is natural to man or whether it is part of the curse that was laid upon him when he was thrown out of the Garden of Eden "by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou labour"— and I wonder whether that is entirely a correct concept. Perhaps it is something we can alter. I rather think that we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to alter the economy—yes, certainly—but we have to break the problem down to terms of practicality, putting the emphasis where they 	<i>should</i> be. The emphasis in Wales, surely, must be first of all on anything and everything that will regenerate the life of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we must not be too squeamish, about getting rid of shibboleths of established patterns of economic behaviour We must develop a degree of ruthlessness whereby we say that, if something is standing in the way of the wellbeing of the people it is the wellbeing of the people that must triumph. That is the only way in which we shall generate the Wales we all want to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are aware that I have no power to limit speeches, so I appeal for co-operation if hon. Members who desire to catch my eye are to succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Grist 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been asked to discuss the Welsh economy but it has been pointed out by previous speakers that there is no such thing, so it might be thought that this is a rather pointless debate. Indeed, we seem to be covering ground that we went over recently, and in the light of the Secretary of State's speech I cannot think why the Government decided to call this debate. But I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) has a suggestion on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in discussing the economy of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
Wales and the problems of our constituents, we are discussing what really concerns and worries them. Far too much time and energy has been taken with devolution and the possibility of a Welsh Assembly, and clearly we are to have that all over again in the next few months, but some of us at least have been talking about those matters which still concern our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether members of the Committee have noticed, but this last year has been the peak of the economic cycle. If that is so we may now, on historical trends, look forward to a downturn, despite what the National Institute has had to say. Its track record has not been notably good if I remember rightly, at the turn of the year it was forecasting a current account surplus of £2,000 million. It seems to have fallen flat on its face in under a year on that prediction, so one has to lay off on its most recent prediction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we still have the problem of unemployment. Industrial production in Wales has still not got back to what it was in 1973. We have the lowest housing starts figure for 20 years in the first six months of this year and the rising interest rates can only push that figure down further. In my constituency in the city of Cardiff, we have an extremely serious situation, particularly following on the closure of the East Moors steelworks, so that we now have a most disproportionately-loaded service sector and a very low manufacturing sector. About 17 per cent, only of the jobs in the Cardiff area are now in manufacturing, and this means that youngsters leaving school who are not prepared, able or willing to work at desk jobs are finding it extremely difficult to obtain jobs suited to their hoped-for skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem in Wales, of course, is the lack of skills which we have, particularly in what one might call intermediate work. This was referred to in the annual report of the Manpower Services Commission, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite the existing high level of unemployment, a problem of 'mismatch' already appears to exist in parts of Wales where some employers are reported to have difficulty in recruiting skilled labour, particularly certain engineering craftsmen.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Particular attention will be paid to those labour shortages which threaten to inhibit the implementation of the Government's industrial strategy and identify the action to be taken by the employment and training services to alleviate the shortages".</p></blockquote>
That is putting it fairly mildly. We are desparately short of suitable skills, and I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
hope that the Under-Secretary of State will be able to throw more light on the effort being made to repair that difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also find time to welcome the proposed scheme of the South Glamorgan education committee for the £4 million MSC-funded training scheme, which, it is hoped will process—if that is not too nasty a word—1,000 youngsters a year in trying to give them a taste of work and certain skills, so that when the economy begins to pick up and jobs become available they will be useful material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of East Moors has drained the economy of South Glamorgan. It was taken over £30 million out of the local economy, it has damaged the rate structure of the city, and it has damaged the docks. All that was foreseeable. What was not perhaps forseen by many people was the speed of the closure. Those in particular who did not see it were those who had taken early redundancy from East Moors with the lower redundancy pay. They now find themselves competing on the market with those who hung on until the works were finally closed and got very much bigger compensation. Those who went easily on have very much less in their pockets and bank balances, and I believe that they have been rather shabbily treated by the BSC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wondered whether in the advance factory figures which the Secretary of State gave this morning he included the possible letting of the 25,000 square feet of advance factory at Pentwyn in Cardiff, which I understand will probably be back on the market on Monday, the hoped-for letting having, apparently fallen through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, what is happening to the proposed or possible plant of Mitsubishi at Wentloog in Cardiff? This plant, which would bring 700 jobs in precisely the sectors which we need in Cardiff, seems to be somewhere in the air. As I understand it, the Department of Industry has sent a team to Japan recently, and we would like to know the result. At the moment, I must say—although I cannot believe it to be true—the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Hoyle) seems to have had rather more effect in deterring investment in Cardiff than the Prime Minister has in bringing it to his own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precisely what is happening to the Hoover investment at Merthyr? I am for from clear about what precisely is happening there, because that is a plant success
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
story and something into which all of us have been putting a lot of hope for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But surely the real problem that we have been facing in Wales and Britain as a whole has been our appalling record in productivity or, in the jargon of the times, in value added for our investment. We have not suffered from low investment but because the return on the investment which we have has been appallingly low in industry after industry. That is the threat to our future and to our jobs, and not the so-called microcircuitry revolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed that the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) seems to think that to deal with the new technology one needs a fully Socialist society. It seems to me that the revolution has started up very largely in California, and that is not exactly an area which is noted for Socialism or Socialist planning. It is, indeed, one of the most prosperous and booming areas of the world, and the revolution is being taken up at high speed by those countries of Asia which operate on a capitalist free enterprise model. It is their growth rates which perhaps are threatening us and which produce the value added on their investment which we need badly to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I aslo find it rather extraordinary that the hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) and also the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) in his way, in a different sort of speech, did not refer to the possible effects on employment in their constituencies of the measures taken by the Government against Ford. After all, if the various sanctions are to mean anything at all—we have been told that they are meant to bite and Ford tells us that they are likely to bite—presumably these will be some sort of an effect on employment in Swansea and, in turn, it may have an effect on Bernard Wardle in Caernarvon as one of Ford's suppliers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know from the Minister what figures the Government have on the likely effect of employment in Wales as a result of the sanctions. If the Minister does not know what those figures will be, it is a disgrace that the Government could have taken these steps without understanding the results of their action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot in any way in Wales cut ourselves off from the economy in Britain. We cannot cut ourselves off—as Ministers often tell us—from the economy of the world at large. Of course, we have been living through a period of slump in the

industrial world—and, indeed, the non-industrial world, for it is our slump that has damaged it so severely. Yet we are given as an excuse that we have merely been swimming with the tide. But there are two considerations on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened to inflation in this country? I remember the electorate being told in 1974 how prices had risen when we had a Conservative Government. We have now the various excuses why prices have risen under a Labour Government. The argument always seems to be rather different. But in our period in office we had a most enormous expansion—and explosion, really—in commodity prices, which rose by around 158 per cent, during the last period of Conservative Government, and prices rose by 40 per cent. Since this Government came to power, the index of commodity prices has risen by 4 per cent., yet prices have risen by 97 per cent. That is the measure of our competitiveness abroad which has so damaged us and damaged our pound and taken away jobs from Wales and all other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular damage that the Government will always do is to misunderstand the springs of endeavour and desire of the ordinary man and woman in the street, whether they are working for themselves, or working for a small company or a large company or whether they are savers and, therefore, investors in a building society, a company or in their own house. The Government do not seem to understand that to give encouragement, reward or incentive is the only way to move forward; without that one can never get anywhere. By their tax burdens, by their centralisation of decisions, by their belief in a Socialist economy, the Goverment have damaged the Welsh people and are continuing to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardigan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the economy of Wales. I believe that we must be constructive in our approach. When all is said and done, we are all aware that the Welsh economy is one of the weakest in Europe, bar Italy. I am delighted with some of the measures introduced by the Government; many have been of great benefit to the people of Wales.

I have an apology from my hon. and

learned Friend the Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hoosen). He is at present attending a session of the North Atlantic Assembly in Portugal. He asked me to raise one matter in his absence which worries him and many other hon. Members in this House—the needs element in the rate support grant. In many authorities like Powys and Dyfed, and many other areas, county councils are worried. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will be able to clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) referred to the way that I voted on the Queen's Speech. He said that I voted to safeguard the interest of the Government. Just to put everything in perspective, I will point out that I voted for the content of the Queen's Speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always held the view that if a Queen's Speech is of great benefit to the people of Wales I will support. I can give an assurance to the hon. Gentleman. If the day ever dawns when his party is in Government and it introduces such a Queen's Speech for the benefit of the people of Wales, I shall support its measures to improve things for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the acid test for the hon. Gentleman and all his colleagues will come on St David's Day—Dydd Gwyl Ddewi—and that will give them a glorious opportunity to vote for Wales and for the Welsh economy if that is their view. The test will be on St. David's Day, when the referendum will be held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past four years I have attended a number of Welsh Grand Committee meetings dealing in one way or another with the subject of the Welsh economy. This subject worries us all. Our discussions have often become acrimonious—one side blaming the other for its shortcomings. We should be more positive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
in our approach to the problem, and this forum should be used to make useful suggestions rather than merely for tearing down the opposition to one's own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to appear too complacent, I would say that over the past 20 years the standard of living of a great many people in Wales has improved immeasurably. This does not mean that there is no room for improvement in many sectors and no need to encourage growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I should like to say how much the work of the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales is appreciated, particularly in our part of the country. I have always held the view—and I am delighted that the hon. Member for Pembroke is coming over to our way of thinking at the present time —that the Development Board for Rural Wales is doing excellent work in mid-Wales. It has only been in existence for just over a year, and I can say quite honestly that the people of mid-Wales are delighted with the way that the members of that board are looking after their interests. If, in his wisdom, the Secretary of State is able to give more financial aid to the board in the years to come, I believe that the economy of rural Wales will improve immensely over the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One sector that needs to be examined carefully is that of the service industries which play a substantial part in our life. Certain parts of rural Wales depend heavily on tourism—Cardiganshire in particular—but I feel there is insufficient money in many cases to develop the potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wales tourist board has had to turn down a number of excellent schemes eligible for grant, some of them in my constituency, purely because of lack of money. I should like to see more money given to the Wales tourist board so that its grants do not have to be spread thinly over Wales, but I was delighted by what the Secretary of State of Wales said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to see more work made available in this sector through the job creation programme to help the large number of unemployed in certain areas. Whether we like it or not, people have more leisure time these days than they did 10 or 15 years ago, so, with regard to the service industries, we will have to plan ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we are Europeans and have been members of the Community for a few
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
years, it would be interesting to find out what is the net contribution by the people of Wales to the EEC funds and how much money is coming back to Wales. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State will tell us what benefits have derived to the people of Wales from the social funds of the EEC. I believe that they are under-used and that the Government of the day should do everything in their power to get more of those funds to the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest unemployment figures that I have seen show that the south of my constituency has one of the highest unemployment figures in the country. It stands at the moment, I believe, at around 15 per cent. It was at one time up to 21 per cent. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell me whether there has been any research whatsoever into the categories of" people in that area who are out of work, and what attempts have been made to bring suitable work to provide employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised the matter before. We are very proud that in Aberporth we have the most modern missile base in Europe, and 90 per cent, of the work force at Aberporth are local people. At present, it has an excellent apprenticeship scheme, and many youngsters are able to qualify, but at the end of the day it has surplus labour. I wonder, therefore, with all the advance factories coming to different parts of Wales, whether we could have an advance factory able to take the flow from Aberporth instead of seeing the young people being transferred to other parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fred Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to give point to what I said about the relativity of unemployment, will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman. There is, however, no point in quoting figures at present. I know that there is no comparison between the unemployment figures of Ceredigion per person and the situation in his own particular area. But the problem remains the same. A large percentage of people are unemployed in Cardigan and it is the highest in the whole of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for turning to agriculture, as it is one of the most important industries in Wales. We are waiting with some impatience for the amended
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
version of "Food from Our Own Resources". We hope to see some fresh ideas and additional incentives for farmers so that they can produce more to help to cut down our enormous import bill. I hope that it will contain a note of hope for those who farm marginal land, which makes up about a fifth of the total agricultural land in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Marginal land farmers have been hard hit over the past few years by the withdrawal of the beef and calf subsidies and also the lime subsidy. It is accepted that, although they receive general agricultural subsidies, they lose out badly because it is so much more expensive to produce on this land than from lusher pastures. Yet the price each farmer receives for his produce is the same whatever the circumstances. For some farmers the struggle hardly seems worth while, but, believe me, we need to produce from our marginal land. I therefore urge the Secretary of State to pursue his colleagues in Government to apply for financial assistance from marginal land funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now more than two years since the European less-favoured-areas directive could have been applied to additional areas in Wales. The question I must ask once again of the Under-Secretary of State is how long is the Minister responsible to play about with our food supplies? It is time that he was more constructive and realistic in his approach to home food production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Under-Secretary of State is aware that, across the whole country, 240,000 acres are lost to farming every year—that is, a quarter of a million acres, half to urban industry and roads and half to forestry. It would be very interesting to know how many acres have been lost in Wales annually to urban industry, roads and forestry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State is aware that over the past 20 years it means that we have lost 12 per cent, of all the agricultural land we had in the late 1950s. It means that every year we sacrifice an area which could provide 200,000 people with food that must be valued at more than £30 million. Yet the United Kingdom is currently paying £3,000 million a year for temperate food imports and has a massive balance of payments (deficit?). Therefore, I honestly believe that a great deal could be done to save the enormous amount we pay for food imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
I was rather disturbed that the Secretary of State did not make any reference at all to the private sector of industry, especially to the small business men and the self-employed. We are all aware that they are the backbone of rural communities, and it is a great pity that he did not mention their responsibilities in the community. I have always held the view that the small business man has traditionally given heavily of his time and resources to local government, the church, charities, local education and community welfare. Therefore, I hope that the contribution of the small businesses and the self-employed in Wales over the past decades will not be forgotten by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted that mention was made in the Queen's Speech of the small businesses and the self-employed. Time will tell, but if the Government are interested in those people, I am convinced that they will do something in the near future to safeguard their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denbigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that remark to heart, Mr. Davies. In the very short time available to me—made all the shorter by the length of some of the speeches from the other side of the Committee—I intend to concentrate my remarks on the agricultural and touristic aspects of our economy, with perhaps a short comment, if I have time, with regard to communications, about which the Secretary of State so warmly patted himself on the back but with regard to which my own conclusions are rather less favourable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a truism to say that Welsh agriculture, which employed 55,000 of our people at the last count, is one of the basic industries of Wales. That is well known. But what is not so well known is that Wales produces a quarter of the whole of the United Kingdom's sheep and lambs and over 10 per cent, of her cattle. It follows, therefore, that lack of agricultural, progress and, indeed, actual agricultural decline in Wales is a matter of serious concern, not only for us in this Committee but for the whole of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes without saying that, to a great extent, the agricultural problems of Wales are also those of England and Scotland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
particularly those of the hill and mountain areas of those two countries. The problem of the green pound is common to the whole of our agricultural economy. Yet it is fair to say that agricultural difficulties bear more heavily upon the average Welsh farmer than upon his counterpart over the border, for two reasons in particular. The first is the small size of the great majority of Welsh agricultural holdings, and the second is the fact that so great a proportion of Welsh land falls into the hill and marginal categories for which, as I shall seek to show in a moment, little or no Government help has been in evidence for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me start with that common bugbear of all farmers, be they great or small—the green pound. I do not think that I am being in any way unfair to the Government when I say that after the few serious efforts— some four in all—fairly early on in their present tenure of office to prevent the discrepancy between the green pound and the real pound developing into an unbridgeable, yawning gap, they have now virtually given up the ghost and accepted a chasm of 30 per cent, or more as a permanent feature of our agricultural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "or more" advisedly, because it is to be noted that, even after the last 7½ per cent, devaluation of the green pound, forced by the Opposition upon the Government, who were prepared to go no further than 5 per cent., the disparity between the British and the Irish green pound was no less than 37½ per cent. This will not do, because the harmful effects of this yawning gulf can be seen throughout Welsh agriculture. A few simple statistics will serve to make the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the unfortunate pig herd— always, it seems, the principal casualty—there was a drop in numbers between 1972 and 1977 of appreciably more than a third. If that were not bad enough, between March 1977 and March 1978, according to sample inquiries, there was a further drop of 30 per cent. To a lesser extent, the same has been true of Welsh cattle, of whom there were 150,000 fewer in 1977 than in 1974. Again, sample inquiry comparisons between March 1977 and March of this year indicate a further massive fall in the breeding and beef herd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No reasonable person would expect this or any other Government to be able to remedy this situation at a stroke—if I may use that perhaps rather unfortunate expres-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
sion. There must, however, be some forward policy to take the place of the Government's present comatose indifference. Two remedies I would recommend are these—first, another immediate green pound devaluation of at least 10 per cent., or preferably 12½ per cent., and, secondly, an acceptance by the Government of the EEC Commission's proposal that existing MCAs should be reduced to zero by equal annual stages. The Commission has suggested seven years, but I would submit that five should be the objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now let me turn to two aspects of agriculture of very particular concern to us in Wales—adequate support of hill farmers in respect of livestock, which support at present is inadequate, and aid to farmers on marginal land, which is at present virtually non-existent. I shall deal with the hill livestock problem first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pressing urgency here is for a favourable review of the compensatory allowances which, with effect from the beginning of 1976, took the place of the old hill cow subsidy scheme. I stand open to correction, but I think that the basis, if not of the present scheme then certainly of its predecessor in title, was the price of hay. The way in which that has rocketed would alone afford every justification for upgrading this form of aid. I am glad to learn that a review of the headage rates payable under the current allowances is now taking place and that an announcement may well be made before the end of the year. To that extent, I congratulate the Government, but I find no ground for congratulating them on their handling of the much wider question of aid to farmers of marginal land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this issue the Government have undoubtedly dragged their feet and have failed even to make application for the investment and income aids available under the less-favoured-areas directive of the EEC, even though the EEC Commission has accepted that such a course is open to the British Government and, by implication, that the directive is wide enough to embrace areas of marginal land in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the right hon. and learned Gentleman and his two Cabinet colleagues who are also responsible for agriculture are at long last considering the problem and preparing a statement. The sooner this appears the better, for the future of marginal land is one that closely affects us in Wales. As has already been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
said in the debate, no fewer than half a million Welsh acres, or one-fifth of the total area of agricultural land in Wales, falls within that category. There has already been a marked decrease in cattle population in these areas, resulting largely from the precipitate ending of both the beef cow and calf subsidies, then worth about £44 million per annum, in 1977. It follows that unless that trend is halted, in time there will also be a serious deterioration in the quality of the land, with a consequent loss of productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some there are who may scoff and say that this land is not really worth the aid and investment that bodies such as the National Farmers Union recommend and call for. Such an attitude, where it exists, is short-sighted in the extreme. There are at least three good reasons for providing this help, each sufficient in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the nation cannot afford to lose the food produced on marginal-land farms: Secondly, marginal-land farming, apart from what it produces, is capable of supporting a healthy rural society in those regions threatened with depopulation. In this respect we in Wales have more at stake than have the marginal lands of England, for with us a language and culture is at risk as well as a rural way of life. Thirdly, we must view all this in the context of the remorseless erosion every year of both English and Welsh agricultural land, the greater part of it in areas of great fertility. In the decade between 1967 and 1977, no less than 91,000 acres, or thereabouts, were lost to Welsh agriculture— an area equivalent—if I may give a comparison—to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, what is needed is appropriate investment resulting in improvement of marginal land and an increase in its cattle and sheep production. Whether that is achieved under the aegis of the EEC directive or by direct Government aid is immaterial. The cash must be provided from some source, and it is significant that, in the view of the National Farmers Union, a modest injection of about £10 million— less than a quarter of the annual subsidies abolished in 1977—would be sufficient for the purpose. So realistic an approach by the National Farmers Union is to be commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken of agriculture as one of our basic industries: so now is tourism,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
on which between 80,000 and 90,000 Welsh jobs are dependent. Indeed, this is a major growth industry in Wales and probably the only one currently growing faster than the rate of inflation, thanks in large measure to a rapidly-increasing number of overseas visitors. Its potential for Wales is illustrated by the claim made by as responsible a body as the Wales tourist board, that it should be possible to boost revenue from this source to around £1,000 million by 1985 and to create some 25,000 new jobs in it, 40 per cent, of them in the South Wales valleys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, as with marginal land, so with tourism, the Government have failed to take any, or any adequate, action soon enough. Here, too, they have shown, and continue to show, a curious coyness about approaching the EEC for funds for the development of tourism, even though there is here a comparatively open door— rather more open, indeed, than for the extension of the less-favoured-areas directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is about 18 months since we last discussed tourism in the Committee, and at that time, and even before, some of us on the Opposition Benches were pressing for eligibility for tourist grants, and, in particular, those from the special tourism project scheme, to be extended to the whole of Wales, even if the by now quite absurd Welsh development area boundaries were to be retained. However, it was not until a week ago that the Secretary of State acceded to this modest and plainly just demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that we should be grateful for small mercies, but I do not think that I am being in any way churlish when I say that neither this belated concession nor the much trumpeted additional £200,000 that is to be available for tourist projects between April 1979 and March 1980, welcome tough it is, will have any sensational beneficial effect on our tourist industry. A great deal more imagination is called for than the present Government are ever likely to show—in particular, to treat hotels as industrial buildings for the purpose of taxation and capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just want to make two final comments very quickly. One is with regard to communications. I am afraid that I cannot share the right hon. and learned Gentleman's ecstatic pride in his 58 miles of motorway. All of it, of course, is in South Wales. We have not got an inch—in EEC
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
terms, a centimetre—of motorway in North Wales. We were told this morning that further great things would follow for the North. I am afraid that so far as North Wales communications are concerned— I am afraid that this applies to both Governments, this one and their predecessors—it is always a case of jam tomorrow, never jam today. And I would just like to put one very simple question to the Minister with regard to the A55. Let us ignore any thoughts of motorways in North Wales. But when may we hope—by what date in the future may we hope—to have an unbroken dual carriageway from Chester to Bangor? I would like an answer to that simple question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My very last point is with regard to having a duty-free shop at Cardiff airport. Of course we should have one. Our national dignity demands that we should have one. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Oh, yes. And I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will put up a strong fight for it. I wish him luck, but of course the person he will have to fight hardest will be his right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Treasury, who so far has proved absolutely obdurate on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merioneth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, towards the end of this sitting, I shall try to summarise the discussion from the Plaid Cymru point of view and to indicate areas where, I believe, the discussion has been inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole tenor of the debate, as opened by the Secretary of State, introduced a note of totally unjustified complacency. Today we have seen yet again the classic Labour centralist approach to the Welsh economy, which is an entirely piecemeal response to individual problems. We have failed, as on so many other occasions, to get from the Secretary of State a response which takes into account the total position of the Welsh economy within the United Kingdom perspective and within the perspective of what is happening to the British economy within Western Europe. We have seen a failure to talk about the individual cases and the geographical problems which the right hon. and learned Gentleman highlighted within the context of the need for coherent economic planning in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will say that we always harp on this theme. But we have always believed that it is not possible to tackle the economic problems of Wales
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
piecemeal. We need a coherent economic approach, and that means an economic plan. This is not a position which Plaid Cymru alone has adopted. It is a position which is adopted increasingly by local authorities within Wales which, in the course of their structure planning, arrive at estimates of job shortfalls which do not have a national perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is within that perspective that we should see the individual problems of areas within Wales. When we look at the position in the constituency of the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Evans), who highlighted the position at Nantgarw, when we look at the position of East Moors and Ebbw Vale, and when we look at the individual areas which are affected by closures, we must see those problems in the context of the overall job needs of Wales and of a strategy to tackle them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made already today of the problem of Wales as an area on the periphery of the United Kingdom and Western European economy. We have heard again of the closures that hit Wales when branch factories withdraw. In my own constituency, I have had a bitter experience of such a closure recently, where half the work force in what is, by national standards in Wales, a relatively small factory, has been declared redundant. As soon as there is any hint of a recession for the overall company, it is the branch that suffers first and suffers worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has a responsibility here. When new companies are established in Wales, they should establish themselves as independent profit centres in their own right so that their economic performance in Wales can be assessed apart from the performance of the group to which they belong. Where there is a local enterprise—I believe the one in Tywyn to be such a case—and it is profit making, or at least in only a marginal profit and loss situation, the factory should not have to close because the overall position of the company has worsened. That brings me to the next point about the role of the two development agencies. We have heard praise today for the role of the Development Board for Rural Wales. I believe that that board, within its geographically limited area of operation in Wales, has been far more successful than has the Welsh Development Agency, and I think that that reflects positively on the DBRW and negatively on the WDA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
talked to the WDA about the kind of role that it should have in the transformation of the Welsh economy. In our view, not only should the Welsh Development Agency be putting capital into ventures which appear to be potentially profitable and successful, but it should also be looking at potential areas of growth in the Welsh economy itself. It should be operating within a context of a plan for the future. It should have its own economic strategy which it can develop, and for that purpose it needs to have an aggressive investment role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the WDA to come in as a kind of public sector merchant bank. It should be there initiating investment, and it should be backing, in particular, the setting up of worker co-operatives and producer co-operatives so that we can have not only the branch factory set-up of companies which have their centre of capital decisions elsewhere but also plants within Wales which are able to control their own total destiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, we must look to a Welsh economy which will not be for ever subservient to decisions about capital and labour taken outside Wales. We must look to a Welsh economy which becomes more resilient, which itself is generative of its own growth and, more than anything, which of itself makes ihe decisions about capital, about hiring, firing and future investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the Welsh Development Agency should not be a back-up agency for investment coming from outside into Wales. It should be an agency itself creating growth momentum within Wales. This the agency has patently failed to do, despite the fact that many of us inside and outside this Committee have criticised the agency for not undertaking an investment programme of that kind in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister whether he will now go back to the WDA and talk to it again about the kind of roles it should have—not as a public sector merchant bank, but as a public enterprise aggressive investment agency. We have a responsibility in this Committee to remind the agency of what its role should be, and the Welsh Office has a responsibility to ensure that the agency is carrying out that function. If that were done, we should not have the current situation in which Triang workers have to come in here to interrupt our Committee because they do not feel that the agencies

of development in Wales are adequate to meet their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conway)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Grist) implied, I am curious as to why the Government chose the Welsh economy as the subject for debate at this time. Having listened to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's speech this morning, I am still intrigued. Of course, the right hon. and learned Gentleman does have what I would call euphemistically the Rembrandt touch. He uses the odd streak of light to concentrate our attention on the niceties in what is otherwise a grim and sombre picture. However, it was clear that he did not paint well enough for his hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Hughes), who said that he hardly recognised the picture of the Welsh economy presented by the Secretary of State as the Welsh economy that he, the Member for Newport knew, and he then stalked out of the Committee, never to return, at least today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad to hear the bits of good news that the Secretary of State had to give us this morning about the extension of the tourism grants to the intermediate areas—a policy which we have long advocated from the Opposition Benches. We are glad, too, to hear about the lettings of advance factories. But the fact remains that, at the last count earlier this month, there were 89,209 persons unemployed in Wales. Although that figure is an improvement on the previous month's figure, it hardly constitutes a stable trend. Indeed, the worst month for unemployment is usually January, and I suspect that the Government chose the subject of the Welsh economy for debate today to try to pre-empt our choice of the same subject in the New Year when the employment situation may be even worse than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in the press yesterday that the Government Actuary expects a rise in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
United Kingdom total number of jobless next year, and, in view of the rise in interest rates and other factors, a rise in the number of jobless seems inevitable. When I questioned the Secretary of State for Employment about this yesterday, he said that the increase was an assumption and not a forecast. But I am tempted to ask why the Government Actuary made the assumption in the first place if it was not that he expected some sort of increase in unemployment to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members on the Government side that we shall return to the subject of employment time and again in all the ways open to us, because we regard it as of supreme importance to the people of Wales. It is important to us as a party and we shall never let the Government forget that there are still more than twice as many unemployed now as when we left office in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are prone to excuse themselves on the ground of world recession following the 1973–74 increase in oil prices. But, surely, with so much of our oil needs being met by our own production from the North Sea, we should be considerably better placed than many competitor countries which have no indigenous oil resources at all. Where has all the promised surplus gone? The hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) suggested that it had gone to repay the IMF for the Government's profligate borrowing in earlier years. If so, in a sad sort of way I am glad to hear that, because the borrowing should not have taken place in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, really—economic illiteracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sooner or later the Government must realise that the fault lies in their philosophy and belief—so natural to them and such anathema to us—that the State and its organisations alone can best effect the cure we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the consequences of that belief is that Government spending has been increasing as a proportion of gross national product: 16.3 per cent, in 1964, 22.1 per cent, in 1975. The Government have had to reduce their consumption from that peak, but even in the first half of this year, according to a Written Answer I received recently from the Chancellor, the Government still consumed 20.6 per cent, of the gross national product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What that means is that taxation is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
unbearably heavy. That this in turn is a deterrent to investment and effort can no longer be doubted. If Ministers have their doubts, they should read the commentary column in the October edition of 	<i>Wales Ahead,</i> the Welsh Development Agency's magazine. Commenting on the prospects of American investment in Wales and an interview with Mr. Gordon Booth, the director general of the British trade development office in the United States, 	<i>Wales Ahead</i> states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But the Americans have their misgivings, too.… their so-called 'worry list'. According to Mr. Booth, American firms in the United Kingdom are concerned that the British system of personal taxation makes it difficult to motivate their management. They are beseiged with applications from bright young British managers who want to be posted abroad to escape the corset of a low wage-high taxation economy."</p></blockquote>
That is the newspaper of the Government's own Welsh Development Agency, and the column goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The taxation system also militates against multinational corporations wishing to set up European headquarters in Britain."</p></blockquote>
Nothing could be clearer than that statement from the WDA's own paper. While our low-wage high-taxation economy persists, we shall continue to find it difficult to attract new industry and fresh investment and we shall continue to have high unemployment. Therefore, the system must be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman aware that firms which invest in this country have the lowest corporation tax probably in all the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point directly. In 1973–74 the total amount of tax paid in the United Kingdom was equal to £389 per household. In 1978–79 it is likely to amount to about £939 per household— nearly 2½ times as much, even after taking into account the reduction in tax secured by the Conservatives during the passage of the 1978 Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I am on the subject of the Welsh Development Agency's 	<i>Wales Ahead,</i> I turn to the same column, which refers to the Ford factory at Bridgend in these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some United States business executives are doubting Ford's wisdom in siting its new engine factory at Bridgend. Mr. Booth believes it is vital for Wales's credibility that the project should be completed on time and be seen to be operating successfully."</p></blockquote>
That, of course, was written before the Ford strike and pay settlement and the Government's decision to impose sanctions against the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday that sanctions may include the refusal of assistance under section 7 of the Industry Act. I must press the Minister, as so many others have done, on whether any of the sanctions proposed by the Government will affect Ford's development at Bridgend. Is the grant of £1 million for a rail link in peril? Are any applications for assistance for this project to be denied to the company? The Opposition want a straight answer on this because although the question may sound rhetorical to the Secretary of State, the future of the company and its development is being put in jeopardy. We must know the whole truth about the sanctions issue and how it is likely to affect the Bridgend development as well as employment at the Swansea plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point has been made by several hon. Members. Are Government subcontractors, who have agreed to abide by the Government's pay policy as part of their contract, debarred from purchasing suppliers such as Ford who have failed to adhere to that policy? Are their Government contracts at risk if they deal with pay policy breakers? There must be a number of such Government contractors and suppliers in Wales, and their position must be made clear.

One of the Welsh Office press notices announcing the Continental Can Company's intention to establish a plant in Clwyd describes the current year as one of
	<br><blockquote><p>"unprecedented interest in Wales as a manufacturing base for new industry."</p></blockquote>
Allowing for a certain amount of verbal licence in press relations, one cannot but conclude from past experience that Welsh Office Ministers are carpetbaggers of economic optimism. I exonerate the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones), to some extent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State had better keep quiet because I have a full page here of quotations attributable to him where he says that the pulse is quickening or some such. Every year he has made some statement of that kind which has not been borne out by the facts. I exonerate the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for the Rhondda, to some extent because he admitted at a conference on employment on 10th March:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have been running hard only to stand still".</p></blockquote>
This year of unprecedented interest in Wales as a manufacturing base has not yet ended. We have had the increase in minimum lending rate, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) said this morning, money is now dearer to borrow than it has been for nearly 40 years. The current wage round does not augur well for inflation. All this, and the past inflation record of the Government, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Grist) pointed out, runs at an average annual rate of 15.9 per cent., affects confidence. As the CBI has pointed out, there are already indications that investment intentions are flagging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of local government has been mentioned. Local government contributes a great deal to the Welsh economy. It employs over 100,000 people full-time and about half as many part-time. Since the rate support grant settlement for Wales was announced only last Friday and outside the House, as far as I can see, we are entitled to ask how it has come about that in 1979–80 Dyfed, Gwynedd and Powys are down in real terms on the previous year's grant by £365,000, £217,000 and £358,000 respectively. Those reductions will hit the economies of these predominantly rural counties quite severely. They are already among those which receive least rate support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economies of these counties and the livelihood of many who live in them and other rural areas will be affected also by the proposed change in the vehicle excise duty. Although that change is not proposed until 1980–83, it will begin to affect people's thinking now and their decisions as to where they will base themselves for the future. I agree with those who have suggested that the Secretary of State should be fighting within the Cabinet against this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Earlier in his speech the hon. Gentleman was fiercely deploying monetarist arguments about the level of Government borrowing and the consequent level of taxation as being major reasons for our economic problems in Wales. Is he now saying that the real problem stems from the fact that the Government are not giving enough public money to Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not. I am making my own speech in my own way. I am certainly asking for an explanation—if the hon. Gentleman is referring, for example, to my brief comment on the rate support grant—as to why the announcement was made outside the House on a Friday and why these reductions have taken place in the money given to already poor areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we hope to be rid of this Government before the vehicle excise duty scheme comes to pass. But I am very troubled at the prospect of our inheritance from this Government, and I was glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke give an assurance that we do not propose major alterations in the regional employment measures now in force. We shall need them until we can restore the confidence to invest that this Government are so adept at destroying and which they have so signally failed to rebuild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, this afternoon we require answers to the points made about Ford in Wales, we want answers on the question of marginal land—we understand that the money is available from the EEC but for some reason the Government will not apply for it—and we want a clear statement of the Welsh Office's position as regards the proposed change in the vehicle excise duty. Any information that may be available about the development of the A55 will also be very welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the future, we do not share the Secretary of State's optimism. Rather, we view the future with grave uncertainty. Of course, we hope that the situation does not deteriorate further, but our hope does not blind us to the fact that with dearer money, lack of restraint in wage claims and a return to double figure inflation, plus the uncertainty that the referendum on the Wales Act will bring to the business and industrial sectors, the prospect for a significant reduction in unemployment is bleak and a real change
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
will be achieved only with a change of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a Government with a fresh vision and new policies that will inspire confidence and create jobs as previous Conservative Governments have done. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Let hon. Members remember the comparative figures of employment and unemployment. Between June 1970 and June 1974 there was a net increase of nearly 25,000 jobs. Between June 1974 and June 1978 40,600 jobs were lost to Wales. That is the truth of the matter, and that is why Wales, along with the rest of the country, will return a Conservative Government when the Prime Minister has the courage to put the matter to the test of a General Election, whether he likes it or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.38 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Alec Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise until last week or so what a suspicious lot we Welsh Members of Parliament are. Last week everyone was suspicious because my right hon. and learned Friend had chosen 1st March for the referendum. Today they are all suspicious because of the subject matter that has been chosen for this debate. But I did not realise that the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) was one of those super-suspicious people. I suppose that his criticism of today's subject was largely evidence of the fact that he reads the 	<i>Western Mail.</i> The subject is so important, as my right hon. and learned Friend will agree, that we shall obviously need to return to it on many occasions in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in debates such as the one we have had, it is understandable, and, I believe, the proper and right thing for Welsh Members of Parliament to do, to focus attention on the current, unacceptably high level of unemployment in Wales—unacceptably high because it restricts us as a Government from financing the improvements in education, in health, in social services and in the roads which we believe to be essential and which many hon. Members have asked for in today's debate. But equally it is unacceptably high because it restricts the individual's ability to provide as he would want to provide for his own family. Therefore, the elimination of the unemployment figure of 89,207—that is, the present 8.3 per cent.—remains a prime objective of this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought at one time that this was an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
objective of the Conservative Opposition. But I was knocked off that by the speech of the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) at the end of August, when, apparently addressing the Bow Group in London, he said, as reported in 	<i>The Times</i> that
	<br><blockquote><p>"growth and full employment, like happiness, were by-products. If pursued directly as prime objectives, they eluded capture. 'Full employment, or nearly full employment, and rising living standards will provide themselves, if we let them."'</p></blockquote>
I do not believe, nor do I think the people of Wales believe, that our history in recent years leads to the conclusion that happiness, full employment and rising living standards will come to those of us who wait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On nine occasions in this Committee and on the Floor of the House since this Government came to office we have debated the Welsh economy. On each occasion the hon. Gentleman or one of his colleagues has said that this was his prime objective. On each occasion unemployment has been higher than on the previous occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little over-sensitive when one quotes Conservative Party spokesmen. It is noticeable that twice today he has intervened to put a different interpretation on Tory policy as expressed by leading members of his party. Is it the view of the Conservative Opposition that—I quote again—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Full employment … and rising living standards will provide themselves"?</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that the people of Wales will say that history and our experience of employment, certainly in my lifetime, provide evidence for that sort of statement. The totally-free market economy has never led to higher living standards nor to lower employment in Wales. In fact, the opposite is the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last 10 years we have lost in Wales about 165,000 jobs through redundancies. Yet now, whilst we are rightly concentrating on the number of people unemployed, we sometimes fail to appreciate that there are 63,000 more people working in Wales today than there were 10 years ago. Towards the end of his speech the hon. Member for Conway compared some figures, but he did not compare like with like. It is true that unemployment has risen, but it is also true that there are more
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
people in employment today than there were when we formed the Government in 1974. That is what I referred to in that speech which he mentioned when I talked about running hard to stand still. Because of the extra numbers of people coming on to the labour market, it has been essential and necessary for us to run and to create new jobs to provide for those additional people coming on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure of success—I put it no higher than that—in finding jobs to meet some of those that we have lost has, in my view, been brought about largely due to the regional policies which have been pursued to varying degress by a succession of Governments. We say that our first objective—this has been emphasised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—is the need to create a healthy United Kingdom economy, but then to use regional policies to ensure that Wales has its fair share in those rising living standards and increased employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Government created the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. My right hon. and learned Friend was quite right in instancing the achievements of those bodies, not as a measure of complacency—none of us can be complacent about the figures in front of us—but at the same time it is right to draw attention to what those two bodies have achieved, because they were set up for the prime task of helping to create a new economy in Wales. It is interesting that the original criticisms have largely disappeared. Almost without exception the horrific tales and fears mentioned by Conservative Members when we sat in Committee on the Welsh Development Agency have proved groundless. I believe that those agencies have a task to perform and I want to see them get on with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I was glad that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) gave the assurance this morning about the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. But of course some of the doubt was that which the hon. Gentleman himself had put into the Committee, when he implied that the Conservatives would have another look at the DBRW. That doubt was one which he created himself, and that doubt was certainly underlined by whatever interpretation the hon. Gentleman cares to put on the speech by the Shadow Chancellor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman read it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that I have not read the speech. This phantom speech was reported in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> on 4th November 1978.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman said this morning that it was an impromptu or off-the-cuff speech, and I understand that a speech is a speech whether one prefers it or not. Let me call it the 	<i>Western Mail</i> story, if it is not a speech. We must clearly distinguish between a Conservative speech and a 	<i>Western Mail</i> report. The 	<i>Western Mail</i> report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Conservative Government would reduce spending on regional economic policy".</p></blockquote>
Did the Shadow Chancellor say that or not? I was not there. If it was not a speech, something was said, or divine inspiration spread to the 	<i>Western Mail,</i> for the report went on to mention in some detail how the same Shadow Chancellor—it must have been a shadow speech—
	<br><blockquote><p>"criticised the announcement in this week's Queen's Speech that more funds would be channelled into the Welsh Development Agency."</p></blockquote>
No one has yet contradicted those two basic points. We had the frill around the edges of the IDCs and all the rest, but the basic assumption is that a Tory Government would cut regional aid and would certainly not have increased the borrowing powers of the Welsh Development Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have not denied those facts today. But, as part of our commitment to the regional policy, the Government have decided at this time to increase the statutory limit on expenditure by the Welsh Development Agency. The hon. Gentleman asked why. I cannot understand why he or anyone who wants and supports regional policies should cavil at this. I shall give an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency is likely to exceed its current limit of £100 million in the next financial year. The increase by order to the maximum possible, £150 million, would prolong its life only by a further year or so. We are taking the opportunity of a Bill, which in any case would have to come to the House to deal with the needs of the National Enterprise Board, to ensure the continua-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
tion of the agency's work and to enable it to plan ahead on a firm basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman says that he supports the Welsh Development Agency, I remind him that it is absolutely essential that the agency knows in advance what moneys are to be available so that it can plan ahead. If we had not done that, we could well have been strongly criticised. If the hon. Gentleman now accepts, as he says he does, the important role that the agency has as an instrument of economic development in Wales, I should have thought that he would be the first to welcome that measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) talked about the use being made of land. I want to say a little about land and the Welsh Development Agency's part. The agency is the largest single provider of industrial estates in Wales today; its total industrial land holding is about 3,200 acres, of which almost 1,000 acres is held for future development. This land bank is of crucial importance in enabling new factory development to be brought forward speedily. The agency is in the process of making major additions to the land bank in strategic locations: 200 acres in Cardiff docklands to help with the East Moors problem; 111 acres as Ynys-y-Plwm Llantrisant; and a further 200 acres to extend its existing holdings at the Deeside industrial park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, more than just those land holdings, it is the massive programme of land reclamation that is important in this connection. If we do not reclaim the old land and use it, pressures will be on us, as my hon. Friend said this morning, to use good agricultural land, or other land, for industrial or other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schemes approved to date total 6,000 acres, of which a significant proportion— 1,000 acres—is destined for industrial use. I am sure that those of us who live in valley communities in South Wales appreciate the importance of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Evans) was concerned about the WDA's activities in the rural areas that are outside the area of the Development Board for Rural Wales. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the agency certainly keeps the needs of the rural areas very much in mind. Since April 1977, the agency has programmed some 50 units in these rural areas, totalling about 150,000 sq. ft. These factories have employment potential of about 600 jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency has recognised the special
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
needs of rural areas by building groups of small factories for small local labour-intensive firms, such as the four 3,000 sq. ft. units at Corwen and the four 1,500 sq. ft. units at Llandovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency has also invested about £2 million in firms in rural areas. The agency's small business unit, which inherited the former COSIRA functions in Wales, is particularly valuable to small businesses in rural areas. The evidence is there that the agency is certainly keeping the rural areas in mind, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members mentioned training. Most of us realise the important contribution that training and retraining measures make towards alleviating the problems of unemployment. The main thrust of the Government's effort is the training opportunities scheme—TOPS, a good name. In Wales, we continue to see an increase in the number of people participating in this scheme. Throughput on TOPS courses in Wales in 1977–78 was 5,900—two and a half times as high as in 1973. The projected throughput for 1978–79 will be about 6,800. We benefit from a comparatively high level of skillcentre provision in Wales. We have twice as many places per head on the employee population in Wales as there are in England and Scot, land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training opportunities scheme has recently been reviewed by the Manpower Services Commission and a number of important changes have been approved to ensure that training provision is related more closely to the needs of employers in industry as well as of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) suggested that my right hon. and learned Friend had been a little complacent and had not done enough. I do not mind people saying that one has not done enough, but I object to the word "complacency". The hon. Gentleman chose a figure—111 people—and said: "This is how little you have done." Only 111 people are now on the MSC's special temporary employment programme. This was to be used by the hon. Gentleman as an example of how little we are doing. But the real picture is very different. The hon. Gentleman forgot the 2,349 people now on job creation programmes, and selected only one new venture. Altogether, over 18,000 people in Wales are now benefiting from the Government's special measures, of whom nearly 6,500 are now participating

in the youth opportunity programme. Nearly 11,000 places on the youth opportunity programme have been approved. In all, over 80,000 people have benefited from the special measures in Wales.

I know that there has been criticism of these programmes. It is said that they provide only a temporary solution. But I do not believe that those who run the schemes and those who use them would accept that criticism. Many of the youngsters concerned—particularly those on the work experience programme—either join the permanent labour force of their sponsor or find regular employment very soon after participating in the programme. The experience they get on these courses is turned to good use and makes it easier for them to find permanent employment.

I was asked a question about internal air services in Wales. The hon. Member for Caernarvon suggested that there was a need for the Government to support a round-Wales airbus service. The Welsh Office has no powers to make a direct contribution to air services. However, internal air services considered to be of economical or social importance to Wales can, like other public transport services, be given financial assistance through the transport supplementary grant system. In the first place, initiatives have to be taken by the county councils. They should decide what services they are prepared to support. As yet, no such proposals for assistance through transport supplementary grant for such an air service have in face been put to the Welsh Office.

Many hon. Members mentioned marginal land. It is not true that no grants are available for farmers on so-called marginal land. There are extensive levels of grant payable, some at the same level and some— I willingly concede—at slightly lower levels. There is a difference, but it is not true to suggest that no grants are available.

I know that considerable concern has been expressed by farmers up and down the country as well as by the Committee today about the problem of marginal land. Members of the Committee are aware that the agriculture Ministers, including my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State, are dealing with the question of marginal land. At this moment it is under consideration. But I believe that everyone who knows anything about the matter is prepared to acknowledge that there are genuine difficulties in this area which require the most careful consideration.

One cannot make a simple application to Brussels and wait for the money to pour in. Any such arrangement would have to be negotiated, and that process would take a long time. Any changes would have to be in accordance with EEC requirements. Even so, at the end of the day only 25 per cent, of the grant would come from the EEC; 75 per cent, would have to be found from the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
