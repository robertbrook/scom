	<section>
	<div class='title'>Petrol Leakage 10.30 am</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many incidents of petrol leakage from underground storage tanks at garages there have been in Wales in the past two years; and if he will make a statement about the situation. [14784]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past two years, the Environment Agency recorded six incidents of water pollution from underground storage tanks at petrol filling stations in Wales, including one at Bontddu in the hon. Gentleman's constituency which, unfortunately, necessitated the evacuation of a local school and some homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply. My major worry concerns the Bontddu incident, in which several agencies were involved. The Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the local council were contacted, but the Health and Safety Executive declined to act. It said that there was no perceived danger. An explosion then occurred, after which the HSE decided to become involved. A far better, more co-ordinated approach should have been taken. I regret to say that such incidents will become common occurrences over the next months and years. Will the Minister have some input into the current discussions on the draft legislation for the sale of petrol?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise a great deal with the hon. Gentleman's view, especially in respect of the very serious incident in his constituency. I remind the Committee that on 1 September 1997, the Health and Safety Commission published proposals for a new set of regulations to deal with such problems. As the hon. Gentleman said, the situation is messy because regulations date back to 1928. They need complete modernisation and, undoubtedly, his point of view will be important in achieveing that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Health Trust Funding</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>12. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales when he last met the officials of health trusts in Wales to discuss their funding for the current financial year. [14785].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have met a number of trust chairmen. Welsh Office officials regularly meet with trusts, both individually and collectively, to discuss
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
their financial positions. Trusts are not funded by the Welsh Office—they receive their income from contracting with their main commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware of reports that at least half of the Welsh trusts will probably overshoot their budgets by the end of the financial year. He will also know that they have currently been charged by his officials with examining reconfiguration of the trusts. Does he agree that the first priority is to make sure that the trusts are properly funded? The management time involved in reconfiguration is not a good use of their money at the current time. Should not that issue be examined by the Welsh Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman. We are committed to reducing bureaucratic costs in the health service in Wales, and one way of doing so would be by reconfiguring the trusts. They did not grow up in the context of a logical means of delivering services throughout Wales. They were local responses to the policy of local quangos pursued by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the trusts are reconfigured so that they deliver the best services to people locally. We admit that, in the short term, that will take time, but the overall benefit to the health service in Wales will be substantial. Between £5 million and £10 million will be saved in the operation of trusts and that will go directly into patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend that the trusts are at least local trusts. Is he aware that an idea has been mooted in the Bro Taff area that the number of trusts should be reduced to two—creating large amorphous and even less accountable trusts and quangos? Why was the whole process initiated and being run by the health authorities? Why does not the Minister take charge of any reorganisation so that there is a democratic imput, rather than an input only by health authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A health authority is a large administrative organisation with costs of £35 million, and with almost £2 million being paid in remuneration to the board of directors. Surely we should be considering a more democratic input rather than transferring responsibility to health authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales are in charge of the trust reconfiguration exercise. The health authorities are acting under a remit from the Welsh Office to develop more consistent proposals for trusts in Wales. As for Bro Taff, I have no details of the two-trust option referred to by my hon. Friend, but I understand that several options are being considered. I assure him that we want trusts to operate in such a way that services will be better delivered to people in Merthyr and in other parts of Wales. We also want to ensure a local accountable element in the operation of those trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>NHS Internal Market</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what is his Department's time scale for removing the internal market in the NHS. [14786]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Office will be publishing a White Paper before the end of the year setting out our proposals for replacing the NHS internal market in Wales and the timetable to be followed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will know that practical proposals are now being considered to get rid of the internal market in England, under which 90 per cent. of the money would go through family doctors and general practice commissioning groups. Will my hon. Friend assure us that if those ideas are supported by the British Medical Association and adopted in England, Wales, too, will follow that practical agenda?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last week, I announced three locality commission pilot projects in Wales—one in Blaenau Gwent, another in the Taff Ely area and one in the Teifi valley. Those three different parts of Wales represent a totally balanced community—a mixture of valleys, the south Wales suburb-type belt and the rural community of the Teifi Valley. We want to ensure a strong system of locality commissioning, with doctors, other providers of professional care within the health service and local government social services being involved in providing total health care for the people of those communities. It is intended that there will be a strong local budget for each of those groups. We want to see how that progresses before finally deciding what will be the best option for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his answer to the previous question, and now in answer to this one, the Minister said that substantial changes will be made to the organisation of the health service in Wales prior to the advent of the Assembly. Can he confirm that the Assembly will be considering the health structure in Wales? Therefore, is it not nonsense to press ahead with the reorganisation of trusts and health authorities now if there is to be yet another reorganisation once the assembly is in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the Welsh Assembly will have the power to consider how the health service operates in Wales. However, clear commitments were made in our manifesto to deal with various problems in the health service in Wales. We believe that it is right to start that agenda, to get the changes under way, and then to give the Welsh Assembly the opportunity to review matters. It is a continuing process; there is not a full stop to be put at the end of the process in one or two years' time. However, we are confident that the changes that we make will be ones that the Welsh Assembly will want to refine and develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rationalisation of the trusts in Wales is an important part of abolishing the internal market, but what is my hon. Friend the Minister doing to prevent health authorities from trying to influence
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the new configuration and pre-empting a Welsh Office decision? For example, Bro Taff's announcement that it will transfer mental health services from Sully hospital to Cardiff not only pre-empts a Welsh Office decision but is a retrograde step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has written to me about that matter. If he has not received my reply yet, it is on the way. Health authorities have powers to review the services provided in their areas. I have been in touch with the Bro Taff health authority and it is clear that nothing can happen without public consultation on its proposal. I do not want to pre-empt the health authority's decision, but I am sure that it will bear in mind the trust reconfiguration exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what he said about general practice commissioning groups and community health services. Does he agree that the Tory-constructed internal market of health authorities and trusts is inappropriate? In Powys, for example, the health authority has told the trust to save £4 million in the next three years, which will jeopardise the private finance initiative there. Has not time come for him to consider setting up one health authority for Wales with local trusts based on local communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's proposal is interesting but has not been put forward substantively to the Welsh Office. We are looking at the abolition of the internal market, about which the hon. Gentleman rightly complains. If the trust in his area is having problems with PFI funding, he is free to make further representations to the health authority and, if needs be, to the Welsh Office on the issues that concern him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the restructuring of ambulance services in Wales, will my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that when making decisions he will take into account the excellent work of the North Wales ambulance trust?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take account of the excellent work of all the ambulance trusts in Wales. In the consultation process I have made it clear that, although we want to set up the trust for the whole of Wales as quickly as possible, we shall not do so unless we are satisfied that the proposals brought forward after consultation make sense in terms of better and more effective delivery of services across Wales. We must also ensure that the strategic advantages of a national ambulance service will be accompanied by strong local management, as there is much quality management in trusts such as the one in north Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Child Care Grants</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the review of child care grants in Wales announced on 27 June. [14787]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>8. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will establish a group representing all organisations involved in child care in Wales to develop an integrated and strategic approach to child care provision. [14792]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to say that last Friday I announced that a working group would be set up to assist Welsh Office officials in working out detailed proposals for a child care strategy in Wales and for funding mechanisms to support it. The group will be representative of a wide range of interests involved in the provision of child care in Wales. It is being asked to complete its task by February 1998. Our aim is to publish an agreed strategy by April 1998. Any new funding arrangements will be announced as part of the strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his reply. I very much welcome the setting up of the working party and the involvement of all the different interest groups that are to come together to consider child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the working party consider the provision of child care for students in adult, higher, and further education? Obtaining resources for such child care is a major problem, as was highlighted in the report produced by the National Union of Students last year in conjunction with Chwarae Teg. It will also be a matter for consideration in the White Paper on lifelong learning, which is to be published shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give my hon. Friend the assurance that she seeks. The college in Bridgend, for example, has strong nursery provision for students and staff and, if there are remaining places for people from elsewhere who want to use the service. We will definitely consider the matter. I imagine that the NUS will produce a powerful proposal for our consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome my hon. Friend the Minister's announcement. Clearly, the establishment of the working group is a recognition that child care is central to solving problems in many areas—social problems, educational problems, which have just been mentioned, and economic and job creation problems. Such problems are especially acute in the deprived areas of Wales. When the strategy is announced early next year, will priority be given to the communities that most need child care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for both his introductory remarks and his question. I assure him that we will give priority to providing integrated child care for those areas where we know it is most needed. One problem is that some schemes designed to help provide child care have difficulty sustaining themselves after the initial funding period. That is one of the problems that we want to overcome in our new strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Birth Certificates</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what progress has been made on the issuing of birth certificates in Welsh for children born outside of Wales of Welsh parents; and if he will make a statement. [14788]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strictly speaking, that is a matter for my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. However, I have written to the hon. Gentleman with details of my view and letting him know that my Department fully supports his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Secretary of State's genuine commitment to this issue. Will he do all that he can to ensure that the matter comes before the House for the relevant legislative changes, perhaps by incorporating them in some piece of legislation already included in the parliamentary schedule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. Primary legislation will be required. However, I have had a meeting with the Welsh Language Board and it is now considering with the Office for National Statistics how such primary legislation could be drafted and introduced to the House, perhaps by means of a private Member's Bill. If that is to be the case, my Department will obviously give all the help and support that it can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Health Services (South Wales Valleys)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>6. 	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what proposals he has to improve health services in the south Wales valleys. [14789]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out his broad objectives for improving health and health services in Wales in his speech to the Institute of Health Service Managers, and more recently in the planning and priorities guidance for the national health service in Wales for 1998–99. Copies of both documents are in the Library of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already mentioned, action to remove the worst excesses of the internal market has already been taken and a White Paper on replacing the internal market will be published within the next month. I have also already mentioned the two locality commissioning pilot schemes covering valleys areas. Some £136,000 will be invested in those schemes during the next two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I have announced a new waiting list strategy that is intended to ensure that people who most need treatment get it quickly. We will seek to introduce into all hospitals the best practice to keep waiting lists to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope to publish early in the new year a public health strategy for Wales that will again focus on those areas in which needs are greatest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although much of what my hon. Friend has said is welcome, can I tell him, as other hon. Members have, that I know of no reorganisation of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
health service since its inception in 1945 that has been beneficial to patients? None of the reorganisations have meant better services for patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of the royal commission on the national health service, and one of its criticisms of the Welsh office was that it was simply a postbox for the Department of Health. Whereas Scotland had policies crafted for Scotland, Wales did not have policies crafted for Wales. I do not expect this Government to follow that pattern but will my hon. Friend consider carefully the reconfiguration proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As other hon. Members have said, it seems to be nonsense to undertake another reorganisation before the Welsh Assembly considers the problems of the health service in Wales. As my hon. Friend has said, the Welsh Assembly might want a different set up. Every reorganisation is upsetting for those involved—and it is costly, whatever the eventual savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service in the valleys of south Wales is not good; it is a third rate, third world health service. I should like my hon. Friend to consider a holistic approach to providing better services for the people of the valleys of south Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reassure my hon. Friend, with all the conviction that I can possibly muster, that we intend to carry through our election manifesto promises? One of those is to create a less bureaucratic health service with more funding going directly to patients, and that is part of the trust reconfiguration exercise? Although I expect the Welsh Assembly to take over its responsibilities for health care in Wales and I am confident that it will want to build upon the work that we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise that there are serious problems with the provision of health care in the deprived areas of south Wales, it would be wholly inappropriate to describe the health service there as a third world service. I have worked in the third world and I can assure my hon. Friend that they are worlds apart. Given the changes that we envisage—the locality commissioning work, the public health White Paper and the primary care initiatives—I am confident that, overall, we shall hand over a much healthier health service to the Welsh Assembly. We will set a precedent for health service reorganisation in which there will be more funding and better care for patients in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope and pray that what the Minister has told us is true. Some of the south Wales valleys come within the territory of the Dyfed Powys health authority. Will the Minister confirm that there are grave financial problems within that health authority, such that several trusts are facing significant deficits at the end of the financial year and the Welsh Office is now cash managing those trusts? Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that that cash management means that additional resources will be available to those trusts to prevent them from having serious deficits at the end of the year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
It would be unacceptable to find ourselves in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, when there was talk of closing cottage and community hospitals in the absence of any coherent strategy to provide the services that those hospitals provide. If that were to happen, people would say that it was a consequence of the Government sticking to irresponsible spending commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are in close contact with trusts and we are trying to help them, as far as we can, to manage the situation and to reduce their projected deficits. Historically, higher deficit forecasts have tended to have been given mid year, rather than at the end of the year. However, if there are still problems partnership arrangements exist, over a three-year period, to help trusts to come to grips with their financial difficulties.

A month or so ago, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced an extra £60·2 million for the health service in Wales next year; two weeks ago, I announced an extra £9·5 million for the health service this year; and in early summer I announced an extra £8·5 million for the development of primary care and other projects in Wales. We are trying, from the available resources, to put more money into the health service and there will be additional money next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced that there is a need for a European rail freight terminal to serve the long-term requirements of industry in south Wales. The Welsh Development Agency has been evaluating the various options and has been considering the technical, commercial and financial aspects of the schemes. I hope that proposals will soon be put before me so that I can decide whether public funding should be allocated to the scheme. I shall make an announcement about that as soon as I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that answer. I want to stress the importance of making an early decisions so that we have a Eurofreight terminal for south Wales and do not lose out to competition from Swindon and Avonmouth, something that was implicitly supported under the previous Government by the Minister with responsibility for Bristol—a rather curious ministerial title. I also stress the strong case for the Gwent Eurofreight proposal. If it went ahead, that development would be alongside the Llanwern steelworks; the infrastructure is already in place. It would also be close to the second Severn crossing. It would have an immense impact on south Wales if heavy lorries were removed from the roads and transferred to the Eurofreight terminal, thereby getting freight straight through to Europe through the channel tunnel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Officials from the Welsh Office have been in discussions with the promoters of the Magor project, although the proposals are slightly different from those for the other two sites near Cardiff. I do not want to comment on the various merits of those schemes, for reasons that my hon. Friend will understand. I am concerned about the delay, which has continued for far too long. I hope that the discussions are brought to an early conclusion. However, before any public money is committed to such a scheme, it is important to ensure that it is commercially and financially viable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I warmly welcome the additional money that my right hon. Friend has announced today, especially for the North Wales health authority of £2·2 million in the current financial year.

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of north Wales and the Government's proposals for a Welsh Assembly.</p></blockquote>
Before I start on the main thrust of my remarks, I want to make a brief comment. We are having a short debate this morning and I want to keep my remarks as brief as possible. I hope that hon. Members will understand that we are in an experimental period and we are having short debates to allow us to concentrate on specific parts of the Welsh agenda. I should be grateful if members of the Committee will let me know, either during the debate or subsequently in writing, the worth that they attach to this innovation, which allows us to have short, more focused debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first opportunity that we have had for a Welsh Grand Committee since those momentous events of 18 September, so it gives me great pleasure to address the Committee on this occasion. The yes vote in the referendum has ushered in a new era for Welsh politics, which will be marked by greater democracy and accountability and which will bring about fair representation for all parts of Wales—north and south; east and west; rural and urban areas. For the first time, the government of Wales will be brought to the people and decisions will be taken to meet their needs and a Welsh agenda. I intend to make the Welsh Assembly as inclusive as possible—an Assembly that is answerable to all the people of Wales and involving partnerships with all areas and interests in Welsh society. I do not want to exclude any political party from the process. There are no representatives of the Conservative party here today, although they gained 20 per cent. of the vote in the general election. There will be an opportunity within the Assembly for the voice of Welsh conservativism to be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I believe that the voting system that we have chosen for the Assembly elections is the fairest available. In view of the fact that we spelt out the detail in the White Paper, I do not think it appropriate to change it prior to the first elections of the Assembly. I have been pressed by the Liberal Democrats on this matter, but I hope that they will understand that as the detail was in the White Paper, which was endorsed in the referendum, we should not move away from that principle. It may be that all four parties will have seats in north Wales—which is particularly important given the fact that we are debating north Wales today. The political diversity that exists throughout Wales, but especially in the north, can be recognised within the Assembly in a way that the Westminster structures do not allow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The elections in north Wales will be based on the current European Parliament constituencies, which will disappear as there will be only one constituency with five seats for the whole of Wales. I am aware that representations have been made to the Welsh Office about the redesignation of the boundaries of those units for the purposes of elections to the Assembly. Is that matter being considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly our intention that the existing European constituency arrangements will continue to apply for the purposes of calculating additional Members, which I believe was the right hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ann Clwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my right hon. Friend so early in his speech, but I must return to a Select Committee sitting just up the Corridor. He mentioned the system of elections for the Assembly. There has been some controversy over the system of proportional representation for the European Parliament elections. Can he give us any idea of what system of proportional representation will be adopted for Welsh Assembly elections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, there is no controversy in Welsh political parties about proportional representation. The Labour party was unanimous on the matter in February and March this year, which shows how committed it is to pluralistic politics. We have considered the additional Member system and we have calculated the impact of it on elections in 1999, based on various turnouts and votes for alternative parties in recent European elections and in elections to this place. The advice that I have received, based on those calculations, is that with the additional Member system, with 20 additional seats, it is reasonably likely—although no one can forecast the strength of support for parties in 1999—that the system will be broadly proportional.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave a public undertaking to the Liberal Democrats prior to the general election that if the elections were to produce a system which was out of accord with our express wish of having an element of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
proportionality, I would examine the matter. It is my firm view, however, that the system will ensure that element of proportionality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The referendum results showed a marked difference in views between north Wales and south Wales and between east Wales and west Wales. Everyone has a theory about why different parts of Wales voted in the way that they did. What I want to stress, however, is not so much the various analyses since 18 September, but how much less divided Wales is in 1997 than it was in 1979, the year of the previous referendum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The yes percentage in 1979 in Gwynedd, for example, was five times the yes percentage in Gwent. This year that gap narrowed to 2:1—a substantial move in favour of devolution. In the south Wales valleys, which were so hostile to devolution in 1979, there was a massive swing in the yes direction in 1997. Although it is true that there were unitary authority areas in the north, east and south which voted no in the referendum this year, I believe that, given the strength of the no vote in areas such as Monmouth, the Vale of Glamorgan and, indeed, constituencies in north Wales, the overall yes vote is a remarkable result. In all the unitary authority areas with a strong no vote, there was a high yes vote. It is a credit to the way in which political parties and other interested bodies in Wales were able to work together for the sake of creating a better democracy. I am conscious that we need to do a lot more work to bring Wales together. We must address genuine concerns and I acknowledge the fact that we must listen and continue to listen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a little about how I see the Assembly working for north Wales in particular. I want especially to listen to the views of colleagues who represent north Wales constituencies. We undertook in the White Paper to give the Assembly regional Committees. The Bill will ensure that that commitment is delivered. One of the Committees must be an north Wales Committee—I have made that clear throughout all our discussions. It would, however, be a brave person who would dare to define the borders of north Wales in legislation. We must consult on that. It may be that the precise boundaries of the north Wales Committee should be left to the Assembly to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) will be especially interested to hear my views on whether I would put his constituency in north Wales or mid Wales. I do not propose to offer an opinion on that, except to say that there is a good case for having his constituency in north Wales, and there is an equally good case for having it in mid Wales. I would be delighted if the hon. Gentleman would give me the benefit of his wisdom on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond by saying that that is very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously why I suggested it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be gained by operating with common boundaries for different organisations. That is something we have firmly in mind in our consultation about the future regional structure of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
new powerhouse economic development agency. The agency will need to work very closely with others if it is to maximise its effectiveness. That means close partnership with the Assembly, with the north Wales economic development forum with the training and enterprise councils and with the local authorities. Bringing together the over-elaborate structure of economic quangos is only half of the powerhouse story. Equally important is the creation of an organisation that is committed to working with its partners. I want to be sure that the agency will be a strong, effective and co-operative partner in the north Wales economic development forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly's relations with local government will be vital. The Assembly's regional Committees will be an essential voice, looking after the interests of north Wales and elsewhere in the Assembly's proceedings—but they are not a substitute for or a competitor with local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said in the White Paper, the Assembly will have a statutory duty to promote and foster local government, and the Bill will provide a mechanism to take forward a co-operative partnership. We have developed those proposals as a result of the helpful dialogue that we had with the Welsh Local Government Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall produce a White Paper early next year outlining our plans to impose on local government a new duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote the economical, social and environmental well-being of their area".</p></blockquote>
That will give local authorities a new role, working with a wide network of bodies that operate in those areas to identify gaps or deficiencies in the provision of local authority services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities in north Wales and elsewhere will need to consider carefully how to meet that challenge to ensure the maximum benefit for local people. The emphasis will be on coordination and partnership with business, voluntary organisations, public spending bodies and, of course, the privatised utilities. That approach will enable local authorities to deal in a more integrated way with the many matters for which they are responsible. In so doing, I am confident that they will be able to respond better to individual needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good relationships, however, are not simply a matter of structure—they also depend on good communications. We are fortunate that modern information technology offers new opportunities for bridging the gap between north and south Wales. We should take full advantage of the potential that information technology has to open up the Assembly to those people who feel a degree distant from southeast Wales—to people in, for example, north Wales or mid Wales. I want to encourage imaginative thinkers about how best to take forward that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people feel strongly about the inadequacy of the transport links between north and south Wales—the right. hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) has tirelessly lobbied this and previous Governments on that matter. Given the difficulties that he and his colleagues have travelling from north Wales, I well understand his case. Poor road and rail links make for
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
a divided society. It is perhaps not surprising that many people in Wrexham, for example, feel a closer bond to Liverpool than to Cardiff, or that many residents in Newport feel that they have more in common with the people in Bristol than with the people in Mold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Geography does not help. If we are to build a truly inclusive society that shares a sense of nationhood and that takes pride in its collective achievements, improved road and rail links between north and south are essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a trivial point when I argue that it might be important to get away from the nomenclature that is often used. Repeated use of the terms "north Wales" and "south Wales" give the impression that we are discussing two countries. In Welsh we say—or we used to say, before we started imitating the English—y gogledd and y de, which means the north and the south. In English, when we refer to "north" somewhere, we usually mean a different country. We need to get away from that way of thinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that I should simply refer to the north?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to accommodate the hon. Gentleman's perfectly sensible proposition. When the appropriate time comes, I shall of course refer to the west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 3 July I announced a strategic review of the trunk road programme, to be set firmly in the context of the development of an integrated transport policy. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary published a consultation document on that matter on 31 July. Publication of that document honoured our manifesto commitment to review the roads programme while moving towards an integrated transport policy for Wales. I expect the new transport advisory group to play a major part in identifying opportunities and obstacles in the development of a better integration transport network for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. Gentleman reassure us that he agrees with the Under-Secretary, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it the wrong way round—my hon. Friend agrees with me about that. I can give the Committee an assurance without even asking my hon. Friend. I shall take careful account of the hon. Gentleman's comments. The group will deliberate and offer advice, which we shall take into account in formulating policy. I want to take this opportunity to reiterate the commitments that I have given since taking office in May that the process of discussion in Wales will be an open one. If the hon. Gentleman or any other hon. Members wish to express their views, the Welsh Office will be more than happy to receive representations and to listen to the voice of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the people. On 21 August, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary published a consultation document on our plans to develop an integrated transport policy. That document invites views, comments and ideas on a number of transport policy issues, including how to encourage greater use of public transport, more environmentally friendly movement of freight, and how to make better use of the transport resources already available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State made an important point about freight movement, and we have already heard about the possible opportunities for a new freight terminal in south Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, in the south.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State recognise that in the north there is equally strong demand for greater facilities to move freight traffic? The people of Holyhead will be particularly interested in his reply because the Government need to consider improving the infrastructure of the port of Holyhead to ensure that increased freight movements are undertaken by rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not softening me up to get me to commit my support to a tunnel—going even further west. I understand the hon. Gentleman's case. I think that we all understand the difficultites in both the north-west and the south-west, to be politically correct, and especially the difficulties of communications. We must consider the whole question of transport to ensure proper integration. That means that we must take full account of the difficulties of the port of Holyhead and, indeed, of the ports in the south-west, as my hon. Friends have taken every opportunity to remind me. That problem must be addressed, but we are working with scarce resources. It is most important to have an integrated transport policy so that both the public and private sectors can make progress on an agreed agenda. I am conscious of the point raised by the hon. Gentleman and assure him that his constituency, and every other constituency in Wales, will receive due consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document also includes reference to plans to establish a Welsh transport advisory group and to hold a transport conference this autumn. Work on the composition of the advisory group is nearing completion and the first meeting of the group will take place on 24 November. Arrangements for the Welsh transport conference on 8 December are well in hand and I have no doubt that various views will be put in that conference, which I hope will be an interesting and informative day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Wales is steeped in a rich cultural heritage of which it is justifiably proud. The Welsh language is central to that heritage. The Assembly will give full equality to the Welsh language in its dealings with the public and outside organisations in accordance with the spirit of the Welsh Language Act 1993 and in line
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
with the current Welsh language scheme adopted by the Welsh Office. It will be for the Assembly, when it is set up, to decide whether that scheme needs to be refined and how it will accommodate the use of language in its day-to-day work. I have already had several meetings with representatives of the Welsh Language Board and have asked them to think about that. They are working on it. I have asked them to be ready to advise the Standing Order Commission—when it is established—on how the Assembly should have both English and Welsh speakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly ushers in a new era for Wales, bringing new, distinctive and inclusive politics. The Bill will set a framework, but the Assembly's working methods will be just as important. Many of those methods will be set out in the Assembly's Standing Orders. To set the scene for the statutory commission, which will be established once the Bill has Royal Assent, we will write the Standing Orders and I intend to set up an informal advisory group of representatives of the main political parties in Wales and other key interests. We will make sure that there is a strong input from the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advisory group will provide the framework for the information that will go to the advisory committee and will need to build a consensus. I make no apologies for saying that the new Assembly must be a force for resolving differences, not a focus on disagreements. In particular, it must listen to the voice of the north. It may wish to visit the north to take evidence from organisations and individuals who want an immediate input into the Assembly's working practices or Standing Orders on the problems of geography, poor communications and distance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. Friend assure me that the advisory group will be inclusive of all people in Wales and obviously, that includes women? The case has been well made that the Assembly will be inclusive and will represent everyone in Wales. The advisory group on Standing Orders will be an important means of showing that inclusivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. I am in discussion with a wide variety of interests to ensure that the advisory committee is broadly representative. I have mentioned the political parties, but the different cultures and geographical areas of Wales must also be represented. I want to make sure that there is an appropriate gender balance on the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the exact size and composition of the group now, but I can say that I expect there to be fewer than a dozen members. I hope that the first meeting will take place before Christmas. I will announce the names of the chairman and members as soon as possible. Consultation is under way and it will probably take two or three weeks before I am able to make a final announcement. My hon. Friend's case is strong. She has been a forthright and committed advocate of gender equality and I can assure her that the advisory committee will not disappoint her.

The process of developing the committee's advice is a foretaste of the new politics in that it does not ignore our differences but listens to and reflects them. I am confident that we can create a Welsh Assembly in which historic divisions and diversity can be accommodated. It will create a better, healthier democracy for the whole of our country, north and south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Secretary of State on the spirit of his speech. He has striven to make inclusive policies for the whole of Wales. I will refer both to north Wales and to the north, and hope to be forgiven for that mixture in my speech. I want to draw on history—briefly, of course, because I know that many hon. Members want to speak. We would neglect our duty if we did not say that north Wales and its people have defended their language and country. They are a tough race, focused on the survival of the nation, culture and language. In my experience, they are good people—industrious, energetic and persistent. I certainly found that when working for the Welsh Agricultural College and also in my time on the agricultural training board in north Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberals and Liberal Democrats have often looked north for leadership and inspiration. Lloyd George was brought up in Llanystumdwy, Tom Ellis was born in Bala, and Gladstone lived in Hawarden. They all made massive contributions to may party. Lloyd George, the icon of radical and social reform and of Welsh nationhood, combined patriotism for Wales internationalism, and found much inspiration in Europe for social reform, especially for such measures as the old-age pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The infrastrucutre of Wales has not improved much since then. It used to take Lloyd George 11½ hours to travel from Criccieth to London and the Houses of Parliament. In that time, we can now travel to Hong Kong. Tom Ellis was leader of the Cymru Fydd movement and Liberal chief whip, but died in the prime of his life. Gladstone was Welsh by adoption and a great Prime Minister. He was a strong campaigner for Welsh Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can I, a mere mid-Walian with strong south Wales connections, be qualified to speak about north Wales? One of my relatives was born there and two went to Bangor university. Many south-Walians have never been to north Wales—a tragic comment on Wales' appalling infrastructure—and many north-Walians have never been to south Wales. Yet in this and the previous century, many migrated to the collieries of south Wales. Many from the north now live in Cardiff and it is possible to hear Cymraeg gogledd Cymru in the streets of Cardiff as people show greater understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time is right for an inclusive Assembly; we are proud to have achieved it in the referendum. We now have the massive task of uniting Wales and its people—a task that should not be underestimated. In the past, our enemies have practised policies of divide and rule, playing off one part of Wales against the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
other. Indeed, we have ended up warring among ourselves and not achieving a great deal. All that is now behind us. We won the referendum with a great deal of leadership from the Secretary of State. I congratulate him on the sense of purpose and courage that he showed in the referendum campaign. When, in the next century, we look back to the 1990's, we shall see that this was a historic time for Wales. It is now time to look ahead and unite, which we can do through project Wales, the Welsh Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All parts of Wales must be generous to each other. We know the problems of the low-wage economy in Wales and that the gross domestic product indicators showed an 11 per cent. drop during the time of the Conservative Government. In terms of disposable income, those 18 years were years of barrenness for the people of Wales. I know that the north was particularly badly hit, and I am sure that my hon. Friends will focus on that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask what must be achieved in north Wales before we consider the structure of the Assembly. Firstly, we must talk about links between north and south—the A470 and A483 must link north and south Wales. I hope that the hon. Member for Neath, who is responsible for roads, will, in his review, ensure a proper strategy for road links between north and south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rail links between north and south and from east to west also require investment and Welsh Office involvement. I know that some aspects of transport are not mentioned in the White Paper. The fact that the Welsh Office is not involved in rail developments must be considered by the Assembly. It is crucial to ensure a better rail system within an integrated transport system. The north Wales' line needs to be electrified and linked into the European system. We may even have a tunnel to Ireland if that project is looked into more searchingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The A55 must be extended into Anglesey as soon as possible and there must be more investment in jobs in north-west Wales. I have seen for myself, on many occasions, the unemployment, low wages and deprivation in rural areas of north Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the agricultural crisis, net farm incomes of less than £10,000 in upland areas are putting a severe strain on families. It now costs a lot more money to collect milk and there is much inequality. I hope that the Government will consider compensation for green pound devaluations, which is an urgent matter to farmers in north Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of tourism is important, as are the provision of health on a community basis and the investment that is required in indigenous small businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I wholeheartedly agree that we need to invest in small businesses in Wales. He rightly mentioned the decline in gross domestic product per capita in Wales, but does he agree that one of the principal reasons why Wales has become poorer in the past 10 to 15 years has been the failure of the English to invest there? Wales can attract investment from the other side of the world—from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Korea—but we do not attract the same rate of investment from United Kingdom markets that the other regions enjoy. That is the principal explanation for the widening gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point but, the problem in Wales is unequal investment. There has been a good deal of investment in mid Wales from the midlands of England, but that is not the case in other parts of Wales. That demonstrates the need for an economic strategy formulated by a Welsh Assembly and directed to the powerhouse, so that we can achieve the equality that the hon. Gentleman wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The added value of farm products and the investment in plant, which is necessary to expand markets, are required through the powerhouse development agency. The leasing of plant to local companies also needs close examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the environment in north Wales is profound. I am pleased that the headquarters of the Countryside Commission for Wales is in Bangor. The Snowdonia national park does good work but, as in the case in all three national parks in Wales, there is a need to involve the local communities more closely. They should have more elected representatives on the national park bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality of the north Wales coastal environment—the beaches, for example—is vital. I was involved in rural skills training for the whole of Wales and I signed up 152 instructors in the ATB network who has such diverse skills as stonewalling, information technology, shearing, woodlands—with the co-operation of Coed Cymru—and sheepdog training. There is a great reserve of skills in north Wales to be tapped and I hope that rural skills training will be high on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European dimension is important. The Interreg projects with Ireland are vital. The fact that objective 5B will give way to objective 2 is a significant change. The concentration on unemployment and low wages will also be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Assmebly must not be semi-detached from north Wales or any other part of the country. It will have a Committee structure, on which the north will be fully represented. The regional Committees must be linked to the economic Committees and economic developments as well as to such matters as rural projects, local government, health, and tourism. It is important that the Committees that deal with north Wales should be coterminous bodies, so that the north can speak with one voice. However, there are anomalies, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said. For example, we would be sory to see Meirionnydd leave the mid Wales economic development area where is has contributed strongly to rural development. Meirionnydd is similar to the mid Wales counties in terms of employment, self-employment and many other indicators, so there must be a degree of focus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the north will have an immense contribution to make to the Welsh Assembly. It is vital that the Assembly is inclusive. I hope that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Secretary of State will consider how many Members the Assmebly should have before taking through Parliament the Bill that will establish the Assembly. We know how Wales voted in the referendum, and we suggest that the Assembly should have 10 more Members to ensure that those areas which felt slightly left out of the process will be included in an effective, inclusive Assembly for the good of all Wales, and in which north Wales will make a massive contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) mentioned a number of matters, but I shall focus on the Assembly. Given that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said today, I am sure that he would welcome a costed outline of hon. Gentleman's proposals so that we could consider which should be the priority, because the Liberal Democrats' proposed I p tax rise would have to be spent 40 times over on each of his proposals. I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's list of priorities, rather than his list of dreams and opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the result in Wales. The yes vote was a tremendous improvement on 1979. The rise from about 20 per cent. in 1979 to more than 50 per cent. in 1997 is a great personal achievement for those parties and individuals who campaigned strongly for a yes vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The yes vote in my constituency also increased. It is difficult to compare the figures, but in Clwyd in 1979, 21 per cent. of the population voted yes and in Flintshire—my county—38 per cent. of people voted yes. That is a major swing in public opinion. In Clwyd, 40 per cent. voted yes—a doubling of the 1979 figure. Although there was no majority, we should pay tribute to the strong yes campaign and the turn around in public opinion that has taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I acknowledge that there was a significant no vote in both my hon. Friend's constituency and mine, does he agree that many people felt that they did not understand the issues during the referendum campaign? They did not understand what was being proposed, nor did they understand the current governance in Wales. There is a great opportunity to ask our colleges and other educational institutions to become involved in a public education programme so that everyone in Wales can understand the proposals and move away from some of the prejudices that marked the referendum campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much agree with my hon. Friend. I wanted to make a similar point because 18 September marked the start of the process, not its end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the cross-party nature of the cooperation and support in north Wales. All Members who represent seats in the north signed a letter urging support for the Assembly, as did our Member of the European Parliament, Joe Wilson. I think that all local authorities in north Wales campaigned for a yes vote. There is a strong base of support for a yes vote and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
much good will among elected representatives in north Wales for the project to be a success. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can take from today's sitting the fact that the Members of this House want to work with him to ensure that it is a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that the absent party from our meeting—the Conservative party—will bury its differences about the Assembly and come on board. There are people in my constituency who voted Conservative, and I plead with the Conservative party to bury its differences over the Assembly and to make it work. Inclusiveness is important; the Conservative party has a role throughout Wales—in the north and in the south—and it should be represented. The best way for it to be represented is to take the ball and run with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will be a good thing: it will cut down the quangos; it will improve local accountability; it will improve public services; it will give local control to local people; it will promote economic competence and development; it will add to the job-creating prospects of north Wales; and it will give us a stronger voice in Europe. For all those reasons, I welcome the result of the vote on 18 September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I represent a seat in north Wales, I must recognise that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth mentioned, some people remain to be convinced. The argument for the Assembly was not necessarily won and some people feared the Assembly, did not understand the proposals and so did not vote for them. There was no majority in Wrexham, Flintshire, Denbighshire or Conwy for the proposals. However, it was an all-Wales vote, and I hope that those people who voted no will now be brought on board and will help support the Assembly to make it a success. That is why I welcome our debate today and the efforts that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made to meet Labour Members and others to discuss the concerns of north Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to mention three things which I think that the Secretary of State should consider. The first is the need to continue the campaign. We need to make the Assembly inclusive; we need to explain it—as my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth has said—in stronger and clearer terms, so that people understand what it is and how it will relate to their lives. The campaign did not end on 18 September; it commenced then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will be open to consider views during the passage of the Bill, that he will press home the proposals for which he has a mandate, and for which we were elected to campaign, but that in doing so he will take the people of north Wales with him. I hope that there will be a campaign to explain the Assembly and to ensure that constituents who are concerned are drawn into the process so that they feel involved. I hope that, during the passage of the Bill, there will be the opportunity for discussions with trade unions, local authorities, businesses and people in community groups in the north, south, east and west to explain and develop the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Secondly, I hope that the Secretary of State will encourage participation. I recognise that many decisions are for the Assembly to take, but the Secretary of State has a key role to play in encouraging it. I hope that the Assembly will consider occasionally meeting in the north, not just as a northern Committee but as an Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can use some of the spare office accommodation in county hall in Mold to establish a one-stop shop, so that constituents can call in to find out about the Assembly and perhaps, as my right hon. Friend mentioned, contact its headquarters in Cardiff on the Internet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can consider diversifying some of the administrative functions that are currently undertaken in Cardiff and moving them to constituencies in the north—not just to my part of north-east Wales but throughout the north. Without being too prescriptive, I hope that my right hon. Friend will indicate his willingness to consider those issues and recognise that people want to discuss them both now and once the Assembly is established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to raise the issue mentioned by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire—transport links. I do not go to Cardiff very often because I have no need to, but I looked up the train timetable from the main station in my constituency. There are two direct trains each day from my constituency to Cardiff. The first, the Flint, leaves at 6.47 am and takes three hours and 19 minutes to get to Cardiff, before any delays arriving at 10.06 am. That does not include the time taken to get to the station at either end. The last direct train back leaves at 17.45 and gets in at 21.09, taking over three hours, without the time taken to travel to and from the station at either end. So without any delays, it is a four hour journey on the only two direct trains per day from my constituency to Cardiff. Those links must be improved if people are to feel part of the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The journey by car takes more than four hours; there are no regular plane services to Cardiff from Hawarden airport in your constituency, Mr. Jones. Perhaps those issues can be considered. The Assembly has great possibilities and I hope that my comments are regarded as constructive by the Secretary of State. We must ensure that the project works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My part of north Wales looks east-west and across the border to Liverpool and Merseyside. It does not look north-south. There is much that we can do to improve that situation. I want the Assembly to work; I want it to be inclusive. The Secretary of State should remember—to repeat the phrase that is being used this week—that perception is all. We must tackle perceptions and work on them, and ensure that the people who voted no are brought on board to make the Assembly a success. I hope that my right hon. Friend can respond to my points. I may have to leave the Room, Mr. Jones, to take part in a Division in another Committee Room. I hope that you understand but, hopefully, I shall be back here for the winding-up speech of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, first, to observe your suggestion, Mr. Jones, and also because I am about to lose my voice because of a heavy cold. I have no doubt that that will be of comfort to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Committee has convened to discuss the role of the north of Wales within the Welsh Assembly. I trust that the Government will carry forward their intention to advance inclusivity and, in so doing, will allay some generally held views in some parts of north Wales. As the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) said, there is a feeling that Cardiff is distant and, perhaps, even more distant than Westminster. Such a view was one of the main planks of the no-vote propaganda in north and mid-Wales and it was obvious that that black propaganda was gaining ground. I believe that matters should be put right from the beginning, thus not allowing fragmentation of support for the first all-Wales forum to discuss the governance of Wales that the country will experience for more than seven centuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be careful to ensure that the maximum support is available for the Assembly and that it comes from all shades of political opinion. I endorse what the hon. Member for Delyn said about the absent party from our proceedings, which concerns all of Wales from Anglesey to Monmouth. It is clear that one of the concerns felt by hon. Members during the passage of the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 was that there should be a fragmentation of strategic services when two county councils work closely together to provide a specialised service—often sharing the costs involved. With the setting up of 22 unitary authorities went the fear that they would be too small to offer strategic views on matters. That is evident in some parts of Wales and we now have an opportunity to deal with that fault. Many members of the Committee argued during the passage of that Act for an all-Wales forum such as the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the health authorities and trusts have been reconfigured—to use the Welsh Office word. I accept that there may be a need to examine the matter and indeed, it is always important to evaluate the quality of service that is delivered. However, why the almost indecent haste to push through such changes, given that they will be effective only a few days before the elections for the Welsh Assembly? I do not understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially puzzling when we are frequently told by Welsh Office Ministers that health matters will most certainly become a responsibility of the Assembly. Given that, why not shelve the changes for the time being so that the Assembly can consider the health needs of Wales as a priority and make it one of its earliest tasks? To press on with the changes is a slight to the Assembly; it could take that view and may want to change the configuration again. As was said by the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd), there are costs and much uncertainty involved each time a configuration or reconfiguration is discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should reiterate that we do not believe that it is right to allow the health service to stagnate for two years within its current bureaucratic set up, when we have heard complaints from both sides of the House about the way in which it is working. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Assembly will be able to take up the battle of the changes. I am confident that, because of our consultation process, we shall pass something on to the Welsh Assembly for it to work on for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says but, with the greatest respect, I cannot accept his arguments. The whole point of the exercise is to bring democracy to the people of Wales, to ensure that their views are heard and that they play an active part in providing the structures for essential services for the whole of Wales. I repeat that the matter should be put on hold and should be referred to the Welsh Assembly in due course. I know that the Minister's response was, as always, honest and straightforward, but I do not accept it. I believe that the reconfiguration is being driven by civil servants and that insiders are being lined up for posts in a friendly but alarmingly undemocratic way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman reconsider the force with which he is pushing the point about health service reconfiguration? He is in effect arguing for us to do nothing until the Assembly is created; if there is logic and merit in the case that we should do nothing in regard to health reconfiguration, we should presumably do nothing about our plans to reorganise education, to develop a co-ordinated transport strategy or to reorganise economic quangos—all matters that need to be dealt with and which are an important part of the preparatory work that will ensure that the Assembly has the best possible foundation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the right hon. Gentleman in two ways. First, the changes being discussed in health are structural and secondly, the Welsh Office can, in the meantime, do something by putting some money into the health service. If we are not to have the bonfire of the quangos that we had imagined, let us hope that at least real democratic accountability will be introduced. I believe that I have made my point and shall leave the matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the best of reasons, the White Paper referred to regional Committees, but stated that those bodies would be advisory, without functions or decisions delegated to them: effectively, they are to be conduits for public opinion in the various parts of Wales. I fully understand both the argument for, and the argument against, the empowerment of those Committees. The argument for it is that it will go towards allaying the fears to which I have alluded, whilst the argument against would best be summarised by saying that if a regional Committee were hell-bent on a course of action that was contrary to the views of the Executive of the Assembly, we would have what I am sure everyone would agree would be the unwelcome seeds of discord. We all want to see the Assembly working,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
and working for the benefit of the whole of Wales. It is therefore difficult to call on the Government to empower the region with regional Committees at this stage. However, their role should be further explained and, if they are to be of any use, they must be more than a sounding board for opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 2 June this year, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An Assembly's emphasis on leaving local decisions to local people should create the environment within which local government in Wales can flourish."</p></blockquote>
I say amen to that. I agree entirely and accept that, in the context of Welsh local government, that is a laudable aim. Regional Committees also need to take strategic decisions since they, presumably, will have more knowledge of the needs of given regions than anyone else. The right hon. Gentleman is famed for often having said that devolution is a process, not an event. What better example of devolution could there be than the limited empowerment of local government and the empowerment of regional Committees in that context?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper on Welsh devolution is a shadow of its Scottish counterpart, with a superficial flavour that smacks more of a public relations exercise than a statement of strong proposals for future legislation. However, if it is superficial, there is everything to play for. The recent sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee in Mold was undoubtedly successful, as was the welcome use of the Welsh language during the debate. I am sure that the people of Clwyd were appreciative of—I shall not say impressed by—the fact that there was a sitting in Mold. For that day at least, government was truly taken to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman and I am sure that the matter will be addressed in the near future.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yestereday, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs sat at Mold and such developments can only be to the good. I hope that the Assembly will meet outside Cardiff not too infrequently and that, from the start, people in Wales, whether north, south, west or mid, can feel that they are part of that interesting development. It could be argued from the devolution vote that some parts of Wales are more interested than Cardiff, but I shall resist towing that destructive line this morning. However, it is as well to remind hon. Members that every part of Wales played a role in securing a positive outcome to the devolution
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
campaign. The 10,000 votes in Monmouth which were cast in favour of an Assembly were as important as the huge majorities in Carmarthen, Gwynedd and elsewhere. We must accommodate all the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Assembly will have a golden opportunity to consider the interests of Wales, which is currently in crisis. The farming industry is under threat and one of the main priorities of the Welsh Assembly must be the revitalisation of Welsh agriculture and the rural economy generally. The Assembly will be well placed to do that and it should be one of its first tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the plans for the economic powerhouse are a precursor of the shape and extent of regional Committees. We see from the White Paper that the number of Welsh training and enterprise councils is to be reduced from six to four. The proposed economic forums are intended to be decision-making bodies in at least mapping out strategic directions for their areas. If the forums are to be coterminous with the regional Committees of the Assembly, is it not strange that they will have certain limited executive functions, yet a regional Committee of the Assembly will be strictly advisory? Perhaps the Minister will respond to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On membership of regional Committees I strongly favour the co-opting of local authority representatives, Members of Parliament and MEPs, and I suggest that representatives of the business community should also be co-opted because it is important that changes in government in Wales provide a system within which business in Wales can have confidence and grow. That is particularly relevant to the availability of European grant aid, as well as transport, environmental policy, higher education, partnerships offered to business locally and the planning system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already suggested that the regional Committees should have members co-opted from local authorities. That there should be a constructive relationship between the Assembly and local government goes without saying. I would welcome an assurance that, along the lines of true devolution, there will be no movement of powers and obligations away from local authorities to the Assembly, but that any movement should be vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partnership with local government would mean that further empowerment of local government and the role of the Assembly could be of considerable assistance to local government—for example, by providing a strong voice on the European mainland where, increasingly, local authority attention is drawn. That will be a natural progression, bearing in mind the Assembly's role within Europe and the regions and the Welsh local authorities' far-sightedness, for example, in partly funding the Welsh economic centre in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chinese have a proverb—may you live in interesting times. Although it has a totally different meaning, we in Wales live in interesting times. I trust that the next few months will evidence a series of mature debates on the Welsh Assembly and its setting up which do credit to all in Welsh politics. We have an historic opportunity to put in place something that will

improve the quality of life of our constituents and I know that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will be driven by that aim. That certainty of purpose and that unanimity will ensure that we have a system of governance in Wales in 1999 which is far more in touch with the reality of government in the 21st century and which is in the mainstream of European governmental trends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to concentrate on job creation in north Wales. I received on Friday from the House of Commons Library a league table of jobs created by inward investment in Wales. The table is broken down into the 22 unitary authorities. At the top of the table for jobs created by foreign inward investment is Newport with 8,008 jobs, followed by Caerphilly with 2,280 new jobs and Cardiff with 1,992. At the bottom of the league table is Conwy with no new jobs created from foreign inward investment in the past three years, followed by Pembrokeshire with 19 new jobs and Denbighshire with 24 new jobs. In total, 12,280 new jobs have been created for the top three counties by foreign inward investment in the past three years; for the bottom three counties, that total is just 43 new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Steps were taken last year to redress the imbalance by creating target investment areas. It is hoped that 50 per cent. of new investors coming into Wales will target those areas. I hope that that is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the work of my fellow Members of Parliament in north-east Wales who for 15 years banged the drum for investment and jobs in their area. I congratulate hon. Members who represent constituencies in north-west Wales who, on seeing the success of their colleagues in north-east Wales, began to bang the drum for their area. Where were those who should have been banging the drum for the central part of north Wales? Why have only 40 jobs been created in Denbighshire and Conwy in three years? That important question needs to be answered. I shall be banging the drum as a Member of Parliament representing a constituency in the central part of north Wales for jobs and investment in my area. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am coming to the point. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales knows what I am going to go on about—my area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that Denbighshire is 20th in a league table of 22, with one of the worst job creation records in Wales. The northern part of Denbighshire is not included in the new target investment area. We have been lumped with north-east Wales, but we would have liked to have been lumped with north-west Wales so that we could take part in the new job creation which will result from the scheme to target investment areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More specifically, St. Asaph business park in my constituency was built seven years ago at a cost of 11.5 million of taxpayers' money—£2·5 million for
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the flyover alone. It was supposed to create 2,000 jobs in my constituency; it has created 100 jobs, 54 of which are with the Welsh Development Agency which relocated there because it was embarrassed that no jobs had been created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want my area and my constituency to be included in the new target investment area. The success of the Welsh Assembly will depend on its ability to create jobs and prosperity the length and breadth of Wales. There should be no holes in the central part of north Wales; any holes should be filled with jobs. We need investors. The scepticism and doubt in Denbighshire and Conwy can be overcome if the Welsh Assembly delivers on jobs in my area. I urge my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to push for jobs for the central parts of north Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and address straight away the point made by the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane). One of the tests of the Assembly's ability to deliver the goods will be the economic well being of all parts of Wales, especially the western parts of the north and the south. That is a challenge. It is sometimes felt that the Welsh Development Agency and other agencies take decisions without being sensitive to the needs of the more outlying parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd made an important point about the lack of understanding that many people showed during the referendum campaign—many people did not vote simply because they did not understand the issues. The best way to understand the view of the north of Wales—perhaps I should refer simply to the north—during the campaign was to ask, "Where are decisions currently being taken? Are they being taken in Cardiff, in the Welsh Office and in the all-Wales quangos?" The three Ministers have constituencies in the south, which is fair enough. The north of Wales does not currently have a voice on those quangos or in the civil service structure. The Assembly will bring answerability. People from the north of Wales and from other parts will go to Cardiff to argue their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed—as were many other people—that our capital city did not deliver a yes vote. I do not, however, accept the argument that the Assembly should therefore be based in Carmarthen, Caernarfon, Machynlleth or elsewhere. Cardiff is our capital city, but I must say to its people, "Please remember that your capital city has a responsibility to the rest of Wales—to the north, the west and mid Wales." The Assembly will bring to Cardiff many hundreds of jobs that would not otherwise have existed, and I hope that the good people of Cardiff will be conscious of their responsibility to other parts of Wales—I am sure that they will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
If Cardiff is to grow as a capital city, there must be improvement in transport. During the last parliamentary year, I travelled to London by train every week without exception—I have not taken the car once. If I am elected to the Assembly I want to do the same. We need a proper train service from the north to Cardiff. There should be three or four trains each day. Presently, we sometimes have to wait for three quarters of an hour in Crewe and we face uncertain rail connections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elected members of the Assembly have a role to play in relation to the regional quangos and regional Committees. I went to the annual public meeting of the community health trust in Gwynedd. It had four nominated lay members, who, I am sure, are very competent, but my constituents do not have a clue who they are. If my constituents wanted to make a point to that trust, they would not know who to turn to. The elected members of the Assembly can ensure that there is democratic input in the regional Welsh quangos. I must reiterate the point that has been made by Members on both sides of the Committee—if the health service is to be restructured, please, please, please ensure that it includes that democratic input, which is essential if the Assembly is to have a meaningful role and if we are to democratise our institutions of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of the north and from other parts of Wales will warm to the Assembly. That has to some extent happened already. When some of my constituents who voted no saw the joy on the faces of the young people of Wales—the Secretary of State and I saw that after the count when we went to the Park hotel—they were glad that there had been a yes vote. Even eminent people in the Conservative party who voted no said that when they heard the outcome they were glad that there had been a yes vote. I hope that that will be the perception of people from north, mid and west Wales—indeed, all parts of Wales—when the Assembly takes over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time since 18 September that the Welsh Grand Committee has met, so I take the opportunity to congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and his team. I am very conscious of the fact that he was the driving force behind the campaign leading up to 18 September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy was a firm commitment in the Labour party's manifesto before the Government were elected on 1 May and were able to implement it. Some Opposition Members were rather sceptical when we were campaigning for a Welsh Assembly during the general election campaign and said that they would never see the day when it was implemented. I am pleased to hear their comments today, so that we can move forward together with a positive attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not come as a surprise to you, Mr. Jones, to hear me going back to the question of the national health service, as it affects us in north Wales. Many of the oral questions this morning concerned the health service, just as happens during Prime Minister's
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Questions every week. From the financial returns of September this year, I note that some trusts—particularly in north Wales—are forecasting surpluses. There are two such trusts in my constituency—the Gwynedd Hospitals NHS trust and the Gwynedd Community Health NHS trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some major changes are being made within some of the trusts, causing great distress and concern to patients, relatives and whole communities. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot accept the letters and complaints from patients and relatives about what is going wrong in the health service and then say today that we must wait and not take action until the Welsh Assembly is in place. We cannot afford to wait two years. We have waited 18 long years to make any form of change and I shall highlight some of the problems that must be resolved before the Welsh Assembly is set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus my attention on Llandudno general hospital in my constituency. The coronary care unit is to be closed and the beds will be relocated to the female medical ward. The medical beds that are displaced by the coronary care unit beds will not be replaced. As a result of those changes, there will be an overall reduction of seven beds in the hospital—two from the existing coronary care unit and high-dependency unit and five female medical beds. The coronary care unit has saved lives. To highlight that, I quote from a letter that I received from a former patient, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On 13 June '96 I suffered a massive heart attack at the age of 55 years. I was a fit, healthy and active person until that night. I live approximately five minutes from the hospital. That night the doctor was called and an ambulance. The paramedics resuscitated me at home and used a defibrillator, as they also did in the ambulance. Time was of the utmost importance in getting to the hospital … I was revived five more times in the unit and only survived due to the speed and expertise and efficiency of the team of doctors and nurses."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, speed was important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes will mean that the policy of non-mixed wards cannot go ahead, and I am sure we all have feelings on the question of mixed wards. Is it fair and proper for female medical patients to witness cardiac arrests and the associated trauma? Those changes are not acceptable to the community and we cannot understand why such changes are being made when the trust is showing a surplus. The Labour party's election manifesto for Wales made a commitment to abolish the internal market in health care, and to replace it with a fairer and more efficient system. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), for his answers to questions about the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public are looking forward—indeed we are all looking forward—to the publication of the White Paper. I welcome the announcement that the Minister has already made and I look forward to many more announcements on the health service. Wales can look forward to a fairer and better health service, of which we can once again be proud. We owe our health service to that great man, Aneurin Bevan, who was born 100 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee since 18 September, the momentous day on which the Welsh people voted yes. I congratulate the Secretary of State for Wales on the statesmanlike manner in which he conducted that campaign. I also congratulate his ministerial team on their great efforts throughout Wales during the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate is being held at an especially opportune moment and is a clear signal of the Government's willingness to listen to the concerns of the many people who voted no, not only in north Wales but in other areas of Wales. I welcome, the Government's indication that they are willing to proceed in a way that takes into account the narrow victory of the yes vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too much is said about a north-south or east-west split. The result of the referendum was historic and momentous, and in the future maps in history books will no doubt show an east-west split in simple, monolithic terms. That, indeed, is evident from the county structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members have already said, however, that is a simplification of a far more complicated position. Many people voted yes in the eastern and northern counties; a significant number of people voted no in west Wales. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth that the results may reflect the extent to which the issues were understood. It would be interesting to examine the correlation between access to the Welsh media—both print and electronic—and results across Wales. I suspect that there is a very close correlation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already proposed to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones), the Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, that the Welsh media should be the subject of an inquiry by his Select Committee. It will be necessary to disseminate objective information about the Government's legislative proposals and about the assembly. The priority must be to create a sense of ownership in the assembly, so that all the people of Wales feel that it is their assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More emphasis should be put on cultural aspects—on the media and perception and on education—than on structures. I agree, as do many hon. Members who represent constituencies in north Wales, that a regional Committee should represent north Wales. I do not think, however, that it should be given too much power. It should not duplicate the work of existing forums led by local authorities such as the North Wales Economic Forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Welsh Affairs met in Mold yesterday and heard evidence from the Welsh Local Government Association, one of whose anxieties was that there should be a proper match with what has already been done: useful strategy work carried out by the North Wales Economic Forum should not be duplicated by the regional Committee. There is a role for an advisory committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that we should concentrate on the vacuum and on ensuring that regional quangos—North Wales health authority, CELTEC and those with responsibilities for the ambulance service or the fire brigade—are answerable within the regions to elected people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in so far as there is a pattern of regional quangos in place, there is a case. I should be interested to hear what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has to say on that point. We should not be too worried about structures as a means of allaying suspicion in Wales. We should work together on a broad front to educate the public of Wales that the Assembly is for all the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement that an advisory group will be established and will consult widely throughout Wales to develop rules and procedures that will be seen to be fair and to work in the interests of all people in Wales. I also welcome the announcement that there will be a statutory commission whose task will be to ensure fairness within the procedures of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying fear of many people in north Wales is that the Assembly will not distribute resources fairly and reasonably, taking into account the needs of north Wales. In my view, which is probably shared by most members of the Committee, the best antidote to that is the openness and accountability that is the very essence of the Government's proposals. The media have an important part to play: when the Assembly is established, I expect them to scrutinise the work of the Assembly and its executive, so that we know exactly what is going on. I welcome the proposal that the model adopted for the Assembly should borrow from the best examples of local government, and should be more open in the accountability of officials to it than the Westminster model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly should be located in Cardiff. Cardiff is the captal of Wales; it is essential that Wales has the prestige of a high-profile capital city with an Assembly located therein. The Assembly should meet regularly in north Wales: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson). There is also a strong case for dispersal of Welsh Office functions to north Wales, although the scope for such dispersal may be limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there should be a north Wales office of the Assembly; it would be eminently sensible to have a physical presence for the Assembly in north Wales. Much work must be done to improve transport links, especially if we are committed to not having a peripatetic Assembly. The Government should work hard to develop an integrated transport strategy to bring north and south together. I expect that the Assembly will be able to bridge the gulfs that have existed in the past between the various regions of Wales. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the Government were committed to introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's proposals and feel confident that all the people of Wales, including those in north Wales, will have ownership of the Assembly. That augurs well for the future of the economy of Wales, including that of north Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to take part in this debate, to which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have contributed. It augurs well for the inclusive politics that we heard so much about during the referendum campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the comments of the hon. Member of Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) that it is vital to ensure that people throughout Wales feel part of and proud of the Assembly. We all have a responsibility to make sure that the depth of support for the Assembly widens and deepens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leadership shown by all the parties that supported the yes vote reflected the politics that we want in the Assembly. Some of the concerns expressed during the referendum campaign will be met by the Assembly having regional Committees, but it is vital that those Committees understand their task and recognise that other bodies within the same area will be charged with certain responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fear is that there will be too much duplication. For example, under a regional directive the Welsh Development Agency, charged with certain responsibilities, the North Wales Economic Forum, charged with other responsibilities, and the Assembly's regional Committee in the north may all do different things. Our responsibility is to draw those bodies together to ensure that we maximise the voice of the people of the north in a coherent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should consider some of the interesting ideas of the Welsh Local Government Association at its evidence session before the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs yesterday. Some important points were made about drawing people together so that work is not duplicated. It is important for different views to be expressed through the Welsh Grand Committee, the reports of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs and individual representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government have a manifesto commitment to examine the structure of the health service. That is a priority, and I accept that there should be no delay in the reconfiguration of hospital trusts. But hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have expressed their concerns that this is not the first reorganisation of the health service in the past few years—it is probably the third, and there is the possibility of a fourth when the Assembly is convened. We fear that health service workers will be subjected to at least two reforms between now and the end of the century: one undertaken by the Welsh Office and one by the Assembly. The key is to ensure that services are delivered in the most efficient way. Is tying up management teams within trusts and health authorities to examine reconfiguration now the best use of their time? This is not a party political point but one that has been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It is important to recognise that the Assembly will want to deal with that, and it would be a mistake to do it before then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partnership won the debate and partnership overcame tensions across parties, within parties and across Wales, especially in the outlying areas of the north and east where scepticism and doubt existed about the need for an Assembly. The absence of a constitutional convention made our task harder. We were perhaps lucky in the end to secure a yes vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now need a partnership to include the north and east to make sure that the Assembly works and is trusted by the people who will be governed by it. The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd made important points about the need for an economic strategy to ensure that the north and mid Wales will benefit from the Assembly's creation. Arguments on the health service have been well rehearsed and I do not intend to add to them, but the hon. Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) made some insightful points about the concerns that the Assembly must address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural issues, including the maintenance of family farms and smallholdings, and all that makes the economy of mid Wales and north Wales successful, if low paid, must be considered as we set about creating a rational, coherent, integrated economic strategy. Important points have been made about the geography and decision-making powers of the regional Committees. To create more talking shops would not be good enough. They would not deliver. The people who were sceptical and voted no need to know that the Welsh Assembly will provide something that they did not have before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to get political matters right. I believe that we are operating in a truly inclusive way in Wales. We may not always agree, but we are listening to. There is a tangible feeling that value is added to decisions by the cross-party alliance that was, to some extent, cemented together by the "Yes for Wales" campaign. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has emphasised our desire for 10 more seats to improve proportionality in the Assembly, notwithstanding the Secretary of State's earlier point about the content of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Culturally, we must be creative, especially in north Wales and mid Wales, to ensure that the cultural identities of the areas and the differences between them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
are respected and allowed to thrive. That is especially important in the north where there has been concern that it will be subsumed by the culture of the south if not given freedom to experiment and to add value to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are great cultural differences even without north Wales? Many in the old slate quarrying villages in my constituency and in the constituencies of the hon. Member for Conwy or my hon. Friend the Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy have a lot in common with the old coal mining villages of Glamorgan; and those in the steel industry in Clwyd may have much in common with the steel industry in the south. A network of microcosms therefore exists in Wales, and we must consider the north in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and I wholeheartedly agree with him. We all know that travelling only three miles in Wales can sometimes bring us face to face with a completely new cultural identity. Travelling through villages, one sometimes finds rifts that would be uncommon between areas of England hundreds of miles apart. That is an important factor, which must be respected when we set up the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should take the opportunity to sell Wales as a European destination, not simply for the economic benefits, and for tourism, but as a place that can make a direct, meaningful contribution in dealings with Europe. Once again, the north has a great deal to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also recognise that there is a spiritual agenda. We have an opportunity to abandon old conflicts, especially in politics—we have started very well in that respect—and to abandon the activities and concerns of the cold war warriors. As none of us has a monopoly of good ideas, we will achieve a much better result by working together rather than simply seeking to oppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four tasks lie ahead: first, we must ensure that north and mid-Wales genuinely feel included. We must therefore be specific about the decision-making authority that we give to the regional committees for the north and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is important to recognise that regional development agencies in the economic powerhouse have a great deal to offer. Indeed, the development board for rural Wales has already proved what is possible. It is necessary to reassure those involved, and the businesses that may consider participating in the activities of the economic powerhouse, that they do not always have to go to Cardiff. They should make their decisions on a regional basis, knowing that the regional Committees have real economic and financial authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must build an all-Wales political identity. That has to come partly from improved integrated transport. I shall continue to bang my drum for the regional air network that the Secretary of State so supportively endorsed. A roving Assembly is also a tremendously good idea. I hope that it will call at
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Machynlleth on its way to and from north Wales; I assure hon. Members that very reasonable hotel rates can be arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I believe that we should take a radical approach to the democratic project. We should be experimental and try new ideas, which may or may not work. For example a youth parliament could meet, perhaps six times a year, acting in an advisory capacity to the main Assembly. It could use the same buildings and help younger people integrate into the democratic process as they go through their schools and colleges. That could have a tremendously empowering effect on the nation as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Project Wales is about democracy. It is about proving that systems of Government can make a genuine improvement to the quality of people's lives. It is democracy with a hard edge. It is an approach that changes not only the system of government but the opportunities allowed to the public governed by it. If we continue to act together in the spirit of co-operation—my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire and I will certainly do so; I think I can say without fear of contradiction that all Opposition Members are committed to working with those in power and to making our voices heard—I have no doubt that we will provide a solid foundation for the future of Wales. We shall thereby empower the four corners of Wales—south, east, west and north in the years and decades to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by noting that, under this Government—and under your excellent stewardship, Mr. Jones—the Welsh Grand Committee met first in the north, and that now, at our second sitting, we are debating the north. There can be no clearer signal of the Government's determination to ensure that the interests of the north are represented in every policy area as well as in the new democratic settlement emerging as a result of the victory of 18 September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to introduce any rancour into the debate, but I wonder what the Tories would have made of it and how they would have fitted in given that, in recent years, they have excluded themselves from such an intelligent and inclusive approach to Welsh politics. Our debate has contained lessons for them on how to reintegrate themselves into the mainstream of Welsh politics, and they might want to consider the Committee's proceedings as they contemplate their future or their fate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn said, we should not be so modest about our achievements in the referendum campaign. Yes, the result was closer then ideally we wanted, but it was an historic achievement. We have been too defensive. We should remind people that there was a 30 per cent. swing, which was much bigger than the swing in opinion in Scotland—it is almost unparalleled in modern party politics in Britain. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd pointed out, the yes vote in Clwyd doubled, which was characteristic of north Wales.

Let me take the liberty of making a personal point. I am different from other members of the Committee in that I have lived in Wales for only eight years, so I have a slightly different vantage point as an outsider who has become an insider. I received two striking impressions from the referendum campaign, which apply to how we should move forward in the new democratic era. The first was the lack of self-confidence that has existed in Wales for far too long—it is an historic phenomenon on which I do not intend to pronounce in any great detail. When canvassing in the street for a yes vote, one would hear such comments as, "Wales is too small." That is an interesting response. Is it too small to make decisions about schools, hospitals, housing and all the similar issues that affect our everyday lives? Of course not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second impression that I received—it has been mentioned today—was the image of a divided society. That image was compounded by the lack of self-confidence and the fact that the no campaign ruthlessly spread fears that were entirely unjustified—some of those who ran the campaign have much to answer for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my contention that the so-called divisions in Wales are not real but divisions of the mind. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has repeatedly made clear, the Assembly will unite Wales for the first time, on the basis not of nationalism but of common citizenship. We will bring together the north and the south—I do not know whether the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) wants me to refer to "the mid" as well—and all parts of Wales for the first time, which is the Assembly's historic importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West, pointed out that the south is not monolithic. I need only think of the tensions that arose from the interesting process of union between Neath and Port Talbot in the new county borough to be able to say to the people of the north that the south is not monolithic. We must avoid such divisions. Instead of concentrating on parochial interests, we can now concentrate on Wales's common interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or nor north Wales is defined as including the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who, in responding to the question of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, showed the great boldness that is characteristic of Plaid Cymru's attitude to politics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I attempted to fight like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take that intervention in the spirit in which it was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the Committee and, indeed, to the people of north Wales, that there will be more Members—13 or 14, depending on the definition—on the regional Committee representing north Wales than on any other regional Committee in the Assembly. That should give them some reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made a wide-ranging speech, which included an admission that he was an expert on stone walling—I hope that that will not apply to his role in the proceedings on the devolution Bill. He also showed
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
some expertise in sheepdogs and I look forward to his leading inward investment for Welsh-speaking sheepdogs in Korea and Japan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, I shall concentrate on the hon. Gentleman's point about north-south transport links, which is an issue that the new Government are already seeking to address. It is true that we do not have control over the railways, much to the Labour party's regret, but we can still influence them. I have sought an early series of meetings with the railway companies, which will take place during the next few months, precisely to address that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Opik) referred to air links—I know that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has an interest in Welshpool. Air links are very important. I cannot believe that the Members of the Assembly from North Wales indeed, any of the Members of the Assembly—will put up with spending five or six hours getting from their constituencies to Cardiff. I think that the Assembly will lead the way towards getting new transport links that will assist business, tourism and ordinary residents in Wales, as well as the Members of the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To illustrate graphically what the Minister is saying, it is possible to get from the south of my constituency to the Scottish border by road quicker than to get to the centre of Anglesey—I have done so. That demonstrates the scale of the problem with communications in Wales. Until we crack that problem, the unity about which we have all talked will not come about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I think that my ministerial colleagues will concur that we have spent a fair part of our lives during the past seven months—especially in August and September—travelling up and down north Wales, so we well know the problems. It is really an insult that it takes longer to get from Bangor to Cardiff by rail than it does to get from Bangor to London, and that the former journey is actually more expensive. That is extraordinary and we must address that problem, however difficult it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire also made some valid points about unemployment and poverty, especially in the north-west of Wales, and about the difficulties that farming has been experiencing for many years. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) listened closely to that latter point in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn stressed the point about inclusiveness. He made the valid point that the Conservatives have a role in the new Welsh politics that is unfolding. It is up to them, but I hope that they play that role. They achieved 20 per cent. of the vote on 1 May, which should be represented in the political institutions of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the proportional system of representation devised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will hand the Conservative a lifeline, for which they should be thanking him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could review that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is a generous man, even towards Conservatives. We have issued an invitation to the Conservatives—to which many in their ranks have already responded—to join us in creating a new politics in Wales. We urge them; "Don't exclude yourselves; join us in creating that new politics."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn about the need to continue campaigning. As he said, the campaign did not end on 18 September; in many respects, it has just started, as the narrowness of the vote confirmed. My right hon. Friend has established within the Welsh Office a communications strategy group which will consult outside the Welsh Office and will seek to introduce a Government-led strategy of communicating to all the people of Wales—especially those in north Wales, but all the people of Wales, Welsh or English speakers, wherever they live—what benefits the Assembly will bring. We take our resonsibilities for such matters seriously. We shall consult business, local authorities, trade unions and the many other interest groups in Wales, including, most crucially, the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn made a point about encouraging participation and invited us to consider whether the Assembly should meet in north Wales, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West. I think that that is a matter for the Assembly, but I imagine that it will be a difficult decision. We do not want a Strasbourg-Brussels situation, where much money is wasted on a travelling democracy, but we want to show that we are responding to all parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consider the interesting point that my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn made about a one-stop shop at which people from different regions and areas of Wales could find information on what is happening in the Assembly. We shall also consider his suggestion that there should be a north office of the Welsh Assembly. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West made a similar suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn referred to transport and the difficulties of travelling from Flintshire to Cardiff. Of course, Hawarden airport offers a major opportunity for north-south air links, but we shall consider such matters carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that he was about to lose his voice, so I congratulate him on sustaining it during the debate. Perhaps that was why he was hesitant in responding to the questions asked by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman made some constructive points about the health service, as did the hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones). I understand what they said about the Assembly needing to influence how health service policy will develop. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has assured the Committee that the Assembly will take up the baton. We would be indicted as a Government if we were to sit back for two years and do nothing about the health
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
service which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy so graphically and passionately stated, is in enormous difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems are partly structural. We are making many structural changes—for example, the training and enterprise councils are being reorganised and the powerhouse is being established. We want to clear away some of the structural obstacles that have prevented policy in the health service, education, the economy and elsewhere from moving Wales forward. The Assembly will develop and deepen policies. Often there is far too much preoccupation with structures, rather than policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Under-Secretary's speech and I understand that there is immense pressure on the health service and that some changes are needed. However, if there are to be changes to the training and enterprise councils, the structure of the health service and so on before the Assembley is up and running, could either the legislation needed to make those changes or the Bill establishing the Welsh Assembly facilitate the democratisation of those quangos so that the Assembly would not have to deal with such matters from scratch? Will democratisation be part of the structures on which the Government are now working?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there will be considerable flexibility. The Assembly will be the real powerhouse on all such matters. Obviously, we shall listen to the points that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd referred to foreign inward investment and made a powerful case about the Tory Government's failure to look after not ony north-west Wales, but Pembrokeshire, which has suffered badly in recent years. We have established a 50 per cent. target and we intend to keep to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd said about where his constituency might fall and I echo his exasperation and frustration about St. Asaph business park, which is an ideal site for inward and indigenous investment. We want that site to be filled as soon as possible and shall work with the various agencies to achieve that. I agree with my hon. Friend that the key to the Assembly's success will be its ability to increase jobs and Welsh economic health—it will have failed if it does not do that because that is the test by which it will be judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon said that it was vital that north Wales should have a voice in the decision-making process. He made the important point—it was good to hear a north Wales Member arguing it—that north Wales has never had such a say. For the first time, the Government are giving north Wales a fast track into Cardiff, London and Brussels that it has never before enjoyed and that should be considered a great advantage. The right hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of how the regional Committees might relate to the regional quangos; we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
shall want to consider that further. We do not want to jam ourselves up with bureaucratic interfaces, but there needs to be consultation on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy spoke with passion about the problems in the national health service and my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, who has responsibility for the health service, listened closely—as did every Government Member—to my hon. Friend, particularly to her point about Llandudno general hospital; she will want her arguments to be taken into account. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West thanked the ministerial team—as did, generously, other members of the Committee—for our role in the referendum campaign. I pay tribute to his role in the referendum campaign in north Wales. His contribution to the debate was astute and thoughtful. His point about the level of misunderstanding in regard to the Welsh Assembly was telling and his point about the media's responsibility even more so. Thirty per cent. of viewers in Wales cannot get HTV Wales or BBC Wales. The Assembly will have to tackle that issue because if it is to become a genuinely all-Wales forum, we cannot have a third of the population not hearing the debate on which their self-government in Wales is engaged. A wider problem, from which we suffered in the referendum campaign and the debate leading up to it, is that 90 per cent. of newspaper readers read London-based newspapers. My hon. Friend's points were very valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ynys Mon stressed the new politics, which I think we have seen in operation this morning. We want that new approach to develop and increase. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) made some important points about celebrating cultural diversity. We do not want the new Assembly to have a monolithic unity: we want it to be pluralistic and to engage in the new politics. I was particularly interested in the hon. Gentleman's proposal for a youth Parliament—he might have put himself up as a candidate—and by his argument that it would bring young people and women from all parts of Wales into the new, exciting, democratic era in Welsh politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
