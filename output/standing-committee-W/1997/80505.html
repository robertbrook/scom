	<div class='title'></div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to inform honourable Members that due to a technical fault with the electricity supply, the translation service is temporarily unavailable. It also means that 	<i>Hansard</i> will have difficulty in providing a full record in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I call the first question, I am sure all members of the Committee would wish me to express our gratitude to Carmarthenshire county council for agreeing to host this first meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee in south Wales outside Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would particularly like to thank the chief executive of the council and his staff, as well as the Welsh Office, for the thorough arrangements they have made for today's meeting. I propose to suspend the Committee informally for the lunch at about 1 o'clock for a period of 45 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee will bear with me, I now have a brief statement to make concerning the use of the Welsh language during these proceedings. This is the second meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee at which simultaneous interpretation facilities will be available for the translation into English of speeches made in Welsh, but not from English into Welsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House has approved new arrangements for the use of Welsh in the Committee. Members are now free to move from one language to another as they choose, provided that Members proposing to speak in Welsh give the Chairman notice in English of their intention to do so, at the latest when called to speak or to put a question; and that points of order are raised only in English. I know that colleagues will also bear in mind the normal courtesies when intervening in speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to questions to the Secretary of State for Wales. As the Standing Order allows only 30 minutes for this Business, I appeal to right honourable and honourable Members for brief supplementary questions and brief replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>The Secretary of State for Wales was asked</i>—</p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Agriculture (Appeals)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Ms Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will establish an independent appeals system to deal with disputes arising out of decisions made by the Welsh Office Agriculture Department. [39593]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Office does not intend to set up an independent appeals mechanism at this stage, but in conjunction with the other UK Agriculture Departments is keeping under consideration the need to establish a system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Lawrence</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in Britain and elsewhere it is necessary to be fair and to be seen to be fair? Does he recognise the considerable concern among farmers about the changes in integrated administration and control systems forms this year, and the fact that in the past relatively small errors were penalised too harshly? With that in mind, does he accept that farmers feel that the current system means that the Welsh agriculture department acts as judge and jury? Will he look again at the possibility of ensuring a fair means of settling such disputes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the difficulties faced by farmers when mistakes are made on their applications under the various subsidy regimes. Internally, we must make judgments on whether mistakes can be accepted. More often than not, they cannot be accepted. if, however, any fanner felt aggrieved about the way in which we had handled an application, or if we had made a mistake, he would have recourse to the ombudsman, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. Beyond that, there is judicial review, although that may be going a little too far. Such discretion is necessary because if the Court of Auditors were to find people operating the IACS scheme or related schemes wrongly, we as a country could be penalised and would have to pay large amounts. That is why we are being very careful about such applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that there is no translation system at the moment. I know that their questions and answers will therefore be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that that is the case, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that one of the most important means of overcoming mistakes is a mechanism for full discussion? In that context, does he accept that staff at the Welsh Office agriculture department play a vital role in each of the local offices serving the agriculture communities within their catchment areas? As changes in the structure of grants to farmers are being considered, will he ensure that the number of staff in the local offices
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
is maintained so that farmers have every opportunity to discuss their difficulties in person within reasonable distance of their homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering how we can speed up payments to farmers who, I am sure, will appreciate anything that we can do to help. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that if any changes are made, the ability of farmers to communicate with Welsh Office officials will be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Local Government (Modernisation)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received on the modernisation of local government in Wales. [39594]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have recently published a series of seven consultation papers setting out proposals for modernising local government in Wales, and I expect to receive representations from local government and others in response to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the minister agree that recent events in a number of local authorities in Wales confirm the need to look at the structure of local government in Wales? I welcome the consultation papers on the future of local government that were published recently, but does he share my view that we will have to consider radical changes? For example, should we be thinking about annual elections for part of a council, about whether elections should be by proportional representation, whether there should be more management-style decision making and whether councillors should be more accountable? That would strengthen accountability—as would, in a number of selected cases, directly elected mayors. When does the Minister expect to make an announcement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation will continue for a few months, after which I hope we will be in a position to issue a White Paper—perhaps in the late summer or early autumn. We shall look to legislate as quickly as possible. We are looking at all options to ensure that local government is seen to be an effective part of the community, delivering those services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>National Health Service (Nurses)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What plans he has to address the shortage of nurses in Wales. [39596]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A national recruitment drive has been launched to attract more people into nursing and to bring registered nurses back into the service. Each trust is encouraged to implement flexible working patterns and family friendly policies for its staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The annual exercise which examines nursing workforce numbers in Wales will report in June and will provide us with further information on shortage problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think it bizarre that one of the major hospitals that serves the Cardiff area is planning a major recruitment drive in the far east because it is unable to recruit nurses locally? This follows the previous Government's disastrous miscalculation of the number of nurses to be trained on Project 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that there have been problems in forecasting the demand for nurses. It is hoped that, in conjunction with the national health service, the Royal College of Nursing, Unison and the other unions involved, we shall make better forecasts in the future. We hope that it will not be necessary for trusts in Wales to look to the far east to supplement their staff, but trusts must look at their pay and conditions of service if they are to deal with some of these problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with the Royal College of Nursing that pay is the problem in attracting more people to the nursing profession? When Labour was in opposition, it gave everyone the impression that it would give nurses one-stage payments instead of two-stage payments. Nurses feel continually let down by the Government. Would not it be far better if the Welsh Office, instead of fiddling with designs for the Welsh flag and promoting Catatonia and the Manic Street Preachers, which they can do very well on their own, did all it could to ensure that morale within the national health service is raised and that staff received the better treatment that they were promised in the general election?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last pay award, we gave a pay increase higher than anything that the previous Government gave nurses in the previous pay round. I am afraid to say that, because of election commitments, we were not able to introduce that in one go. I assure the hon. Gentleman that much time is invested in the Welsh Office in trying to ensure that nursing is an attractive career. We will take steps when the June work force figures are available to encourage people into nursing and to encourage those who have dropped out to return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Welsh Assembly (Functions)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a further statement on the transfer of functions to the Welsh Assembly, with particular reference to agriculture. [39597]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have undertaken to produce a further draft of the transfer order before Committee stage of the Government of Wales Bill in the House of Lords. I will place a copy in the Library of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agriculture industry is economically and socially important across Wales. It is right that functions with respect to agriculture should as far as possible, be subject
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
to the democratic scrutiny and accountability of the assembly, by making the assembly responsible for those policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will recall the numerous discussions that we had on this subject during the progress of the Government of Wales Bill. One of the questions that was posed was whether a Welsh assembly would have been able to make a different decision about, for example, the imposition of a ban on beef on the bone. Is he able to say whether the assembly will have such a power? How will the assembly relate to the new powers and functions of the Food Standards Agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. Friend to the discussions we had in Committee, which I remember very well. The ban on beef on the bone was implemented jointly by me and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. My powers in respect of that matter would be transferred to the assembly. The question that remains, however, is whether the powers would be exercised individually by the assembly or jointly with the Ministry. We are still discussing that matter. Some of the powers will be exercised by the assembly and some, for practical, common-sense reasons, will be exercised jointly by the assembly and the Ministry. These matters will be debated and finally decided by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the assembly is to have a Cabinet structure, will the Secretary of State assure us that a member of the Cabinet will be a Minister with responsibility for agriculture and rural affairs? That is particularly important given what he just said about the importance of agriculture and about the economic powerhouse having the power to assist agriculture. The Development Board for Rural Wales, for example, has been hamstrung in the past because it has not had those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall debate the powers of the DBRW and of the new powerhouse in the main debate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's first question, I cannot give him the assurance that he seeks—not because I am not sympathetic to the point, but because it would be precipitate to make such a comment at this stage. The advisory group is consulting throughout Wales. It has not finalised its report and it would be wrong of me to make any judgments until the consultation has been completed. Ultimately, it will be for the assembly and for the First Secretary to decide the internal organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Homelessness</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received on street homelessness in Wales. [39598]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Office has received housing strategy and operational plans for 199899 from the majority of local authorities in Wales. I have also received a representation from Shelter making the case for the introduction of a rough sleepers initiative in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. I welcome the increase in rooflessness funding and the guidance that has been issued to local authorities on rough sleeping since the change of Government. I urge him to look at the considerable amount of evidence from across Wales about the extent of the problem in the Principality, and then to look across the Severn channel to what is happening in Bristol where, under the rough sleepers initiative, 100 per cent. of grants totalling £6.5 million has been awarded for projects over a three-year period. In comparison, we spent £300,000 this year and required local authorities to contribute 25 per cent. of that sum. Does my hon. Friend agree that simple justice demands that we extend the rough sleepers initiative to Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are still looking carefully at the issue, but, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, we have asked local authorities to take into account homelessness and rooflessness when drawing up their strategic plans. I do not have any analysis from an official source on the rough sleepers initiative in Bristol, and I would want to see something official before taking Wales down that route. Evidence in Wales shows that the problem is not on the same scale as it is in Bristol and London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Llanelli/Dinefwr Hospital Trust</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>7. 	<div class='member'>Mr Denzil Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whom he intends to consult before a final decision is taken on his proposal to abolish the Llanelli/Dinefwr hospital trust by merging it with a new trust. [39600]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consultation on proposals to merge NHS trusts throughout Wales will be undertaken for three months commencing in June this year. We consult statutorily the community health councils and the staff groups for all the NHS trusts affected by the proposals. In addition, we consult a large number of interested parties including health authorities, general practitioners, local authorities and voluntary organisations. Comments are also invited from the general public by the insertion of notices in newspapers covering the whole of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware—he probably is—that the people of Llanelli described the consultation undertaken so far as Thatcherite consultation, which of course is a fundamental contradiction? Will he consult the people of Llanelli and of the district who use the service, because they are very satisfied with it and have told him they do not want the trust to be abolished? Will he act on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the consultation is to enable everybody in Wales to decide whether the proposals would improve the health service. That will be the critical point at which my right hon. Friend and I will assess the proposals for the new trusts. I assure my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his response. Does he agree that one of the key objectives of the National Assembly for Wales will be to reunite Wales?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on his excellent translation of his own question. If we succeed in ensuring that efficient north-south links—probably by air in the first instance and, we hope, by rail soon afterwards—are established we shall unite Wales, possibly for the first time, and provide the national assembly with a real focus for its work. There are formidable cost implications, but as I learned at Caernarfon airport with the right hon.

Is the Minister aware of any developed country that does not have north-south rail links and a reasonable road transport network? I know full well that he has done something fairly dynamic in respect of my constituency, which I welcome, even though he was pressurised into doing it during Eisteddfod week. Will he please tell me what dynamic action he proposes to take to address the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's dynamic question. I know of no equivalent country with the kind of gap that we have, although I am not a geographical expert. Such links are vital, which is why we are working hard on the problem. I held discussions with Caernarfon and Hawarden airports and with the rail operators. The length of time and cost involved in travelling from the north to the south is unacceptable politically, economically and in every other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support fully the Minister's action on north-south rail links, and it must be borne in mind that air links will have an impact on the public purse. Most people, however, travel from the north to the south by road, and the principal link is the one between the A5, A4 and A470. It is notoriously bad at the A5' s junction with the A483. Can he do anything to improve that dual carriageway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of road links must be addressed, and I am trying to do that. No one can realistically expect a quick service to be provided from the north to the south without enormous environmental implications, let alone the cost implications. Rail and air services must be improved as a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister address the problem of freight, because the A483-A5 is the major freight route from the industrial areas of north Wales to the middle and south of Wales. There are frequent accidents on the road, 25 people have been killed on it in the past five years and there are constant delays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all true, which is one reason why we are anxious to address the question not only in respect of air and rail for civilian passengers but in terms of industrial freight in all respects. Getting more freight off the road and on to rail is one of the Government's priorities. We shall take initiatives in the coming months to secure that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern at the disruption to north-south rail services as a result of yesterday's derailment of a freight train in Cardiff? Does he share my dismay that the disruption could last for four days; and does this not strengthen the case for a brand new modern rail freight terminal for south Wales, based in Newport? Will he seriously consider that proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall of course seriously consider all proposals from my hon. Friend. We are studying the situation closely. Yesterday evening's derailment was

very serious and has disrupted services significantly. I am advised that Great Western Trains is operating hourly trains between Newport and Paddington, with buses between Cardiff and Newport and shuttle trains between Cardiff and Swansea. Central trains services between Cardiff and Birmingham are terminating at Newport; and there are other implications.

The way in which services between London and south Wales and within Wales have been increasingly disrupted is unacceptable and reflects the way in which the rail system has been run down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have done my best to find out about the procedures for appointing medical practitioners. It has caused much alarm and distress for patients, families and the profession in north-west Wales.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point about improving rural transport.

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the rural economy in Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Ron Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>(	<i>translation</i>): I hope that the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) will forgive me if I take this opportunity of welcoming this Committee of the House of Commons to the town of Carmarthen; I do so as one of the Members of Parliament of the old county of Dyfed whose headquarters Carmarthen was for more than 20 years. It is a great pleasure for me to do so, Mr. Jones, and to welcome you to the Chair. You will be directing the proceedings with your usual firm graciousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great honour for me also to be allowed to open the debate in Carmarthen on a subject which is of crucial importance to the town and the locality—the economy of rural Wales. It is more of a honour than a pleasure, I am afraid, for the economy of rural Wales these days faces terrible problems. You might not think so, Mr. Jones, as you look around on a fine May morning with spring in the soil, but that is nevertheless the truth. When Plaid Cymru was given the opportunity to choose a subject for this session of the Grand Committee, there was no need to think twice about it. Since the election we have warned the Government repeatedly that the situation is serious, and this is the most recent opportunity to do so to again. What was a problem has become a crisis, and the crisis now threatens to become a catastrophe. I am not exaggerating by saying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the message that we bear on all sides—not just from farmers, but from business people of all kinds, from academics, the local authorities, voluntary organisations, and those working in the field of economic development. The bare facts prove it, but before I turn to them, let us think briefly about the reality of people's lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was recently asked to support an application by a family of young farmers from the Crymych area for a visa to settle in Canada. The other evening a young man called in at my home to obtain a passport to emigrate to Canada. He spoke to me about the bright prospects of fanning in that country as compared with the miserable situation that exists here, and of others who are considering emigration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also spoke recently with the father of one of my ex-pupils, a lively, conscientious, vivacious and energetic young man working in auctioneering. He had decided to move because the business could no longer maintain his job and he now lives—and is doing very well—in Hammersmith. Now listen to the words of a business man from a market town in Ceredigion who wrote to me in February. I know him well and I know his family—a principled, cultured family who are active in the life of the local community. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are a family business of agricultural merchants who have just celebrated our 44th year in existence, and during the last 18 months we have had to make serious decisions concerning our future. The choice was to retain the business in its existing form and recommend to our son who had spend a period in agricultural college to search for work that would perhaps oblige him to cross
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Offa's Dyke, or to expand our business in the hope of creating work for him to keep him in the community where he wished to live. We took the second choice, and in part the venture has been successful as we have attracted a good number of new customers. But as with all businesses, there are good customers, some not so good, and some bad customers, and what I want to draw your attention to now is that the best customers are now unable to keep up their usual standards by paying for goods ordered by them. Farmers must have food for their animals, and this year they need more than usual because they are unable to dispose of their stock. We as merchants have to pay our suppliers for the goods ordered immediately, but the big question now is, who is going to pay us?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As a company we beg your support in urging the Government to take this matter seriously, dealing with it as a true crisis.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We can assure you, if the existing economic climate here in rural Wales continues, we shall not have a countryside to boast of. Our businesses will go into increasing decline and once more we will have to send our youth from their communities to search for a living."</p></blockquote>
The author of the letter goes to the heart of the matter. What is at stake now is not just the level of farmers' incomes, important as that is, but the economic future of the biggest part of the territory of Wales and everything that is linked to it—socially, culturally, linguistically and environmentally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to Professor Peter Midmore, between 60,000 and 70,000 jobs in Wales depend on agriculture, and he emphasises in a recent article in the magazine Planet that we should not forget
	<br><blockquote><p>"the central fact that food is 'the most important product of the countryside".</p></blockquote>
Now let us turn to some of the naked facts. Income has gone down over two years in the milk sector by 33.6 per cent. in the LFA—less favoured areas—cattle and sheep sectors by 53.5 per cent. and those sectors in the lowlands by 57.6 per cent. According to one measure, the income of Welsh farmers and their spouses fell by 86 per cent. in 1997 in comparison with 1996. What that means in practical terms is that farmers now do not have sufficient income to meet their farming and living costs. And what that means, to the half of Welsh farmers who have substantial debts, is that they are sinking deeper and deeper into debt, which in turn means that, one way or another, farmers are going to go out of business—either by selling up or through bankruptcy, depending on what happens to the price of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the milk sector which is so crucially important to the south-west, with 2,500 of the 4,000 milk producers left in Wales. Because of the collapse in the price of milk, Touche Deloitte have suggested that as many as one fifth of producers could go out of business—as many as 900 of the 4,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is all this taking us? According to Professor Midmore, 8,000 jobs are at risk because of the crisis at this time. Before the crisis broke Professor Midmore had estimated that 5,000 jobs could be lost in rural Wales over 10 years, and policies were being suggested to avoid that. Now we are talking abut the loss of 8,000 perhaps in a year. With that scale of loss, the danger of a further spiral of decline is very real. It is no exaggeration to speak of catastrophe. Now then, how on earth did we get into this predicament? Let us acknowledge that there are long-term trends which are problematic to agriculture everywhere.

I have already referred to the prediction that 5,000 jobs in rural Wales could be lost over 10 years, but the earthquake that has struck us over the last two years is something altogether different—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (	<i>Spoke in Welsh</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis), before we all go into a deep depression, that the town of Carmarthen and its immediate area have had the lowest unemployment rate in Wales for the past 20 years. Running alongside Carmarthen is the Carmarthen eastern bypass—there is £35 million worth of infrastructure development here. The headline in last week's 	<i>Carmarthen Journal</i> was about a £16 million jobs bonanza. The economy of this area, is not nearly as depressed as the hon. Gentleman is making it out to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak in English, because this point is not in my script. I hope that the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) is not reflecting his party's position, because he is trying to minimise the seriousness of the situation. Infrastructure and road developments, important though they are, do not provide a sustainable basis for the economy. Nor do I think a shopping mall bonanza provides a basis for sustainable development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The earthquake that has hit us over the past two years is different. (	<i>The speaker continued in Welsh</i>). The Government scheme to compensate for BSE has been reduced significantly during the past year, but the other important factor is the unreasonably high level of the pound. The sterling timebomb, as described by the Farmers Union of Wales newspaper, 	<i>Y Tir</i> and the answer to the question posed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) as to the importance of the pound, both confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee will be pleased to note that translation facilities have returned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes no difference, Mr. Jones, because I understand every word I say. It is the other members of the Committee who are at some disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand that the high level of the pound is the result, to a large extent, of the policies of the current Government. It was the Government who decided to make price stability a more important consideration for the Bank of England than economic growth and employment. In addition, they decided to use rate levels rather than taxation policies—increasing rates rather than increasing taxes, as one of the speakers said this morning—as a means of controlling inflation. As a result, the pound became more attractive to international financial traders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that we accepted that the policy is disastrous for rural Wales and for Welsh industrial communities. Recently, a representative from the CBI said
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that we should lose no time in bringing the pound down to competitive levels in order to defend manufacturing, which is the cornerstone of the Welsh economy. Manufacturing is suffering in industrial areas, and agriculture is suffering in rural communities. Enormous damage is being done. The euro is also having an effect, but I shall not discuss that in detail. Whatever we say about the euro, the Government's policy means that we are in the worst of all worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government pursuing that strategy? The Prime Minister and the Chancellor say time and again that they do not wish to return to the policy of boom and bust. If I have heard that once, I have heard it 50 times. The message needs to go from Carmarthen to London that there is no talk of boom in rural Wales, and there has not been for a long time. We could do with a touch of the boom in rural Wales because we are surrounded by the bust. We should forget the boom and focus on the bust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policies may be suitable for the Labour party's target voters in south-east England but those policies—high rates, a strong pound, low taxation and low public spending—are entirely contrary to the needs and wishes of the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the interests of Wales mean anything to the Government—and I am sure that they mean much to Welsh Office Ministers—we should send a message to London urging a change of direction. That is all we are asking for. If Committee members want to call that a U-turn, so be it. What is the response of the Minister responsible for agriculture? The key word is restructuring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> (	<i>Translation</i>)	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman who said that we need to change direction. There has been a crisis in agriculture almost every year since the war, although I accept that the present crisis is as important as any other. Does he believe that we should examine not the current problems, but the likely situation in Welsh agriculture in five or 10 years? Do we not need to change the pattern of agriculture to encourage, for example, organic production and energy production?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that constructive intervention, which I shall discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that we need to change the basis of agricultural policy. Today, we face a crisis of a severity, that we have not seen for a generation or more. There has not been such a crisis in living memory—perhaps it is the worst this century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restructuring is the agriculture Minister's buzz word. In the present crisis, that involves persuading as many farmers as possible to leave farming. That is why he links the unifying of farms with his early retirement scheme. He should have mentioned support for young farmers, which would involve restructuring on the basis of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministers strategy will undermine our best efforts to create social and economic rejuvenation. Environmental groups agree that the Minister's strategy would be contrary to environmental stability. I know of no support in Wales for the strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response to the crisis has been entirely inadequate. After ceaseless pressure, we managed to obtain £85 million of additional payments before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Christmas and a further £70 million in the new year. Although welcome, those payments were followed by reductions to the 30-months scheme and an end to rendering support. The Fontainebleau agreement was used time and again as an excuse for not calling on the European compensation that was available and which, to a lesser extent, remains available. If the Government wish to show that they are serious about the future of our rural areas, their attitude must change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantial temporary financial assistance that is available is vital to bring the agriculture industry through the present crisis. Support can be used to the advantage of livestock farmers who are suffering specific problems and who are responsible for 87 per cent. of all agricultural output in Wales. We have heard some useful ideas on how to target and use support. Such support is justified by the temporary crisis caused by BSE and the pound, and we have heard some useful ideas on how to target and use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Creating a sustainable, long-term future for rural Wales is possible. I do not want to talk of doom and gloom because there is hope. One of the main tasks of the new national assembly will be to propose a strategy for the long term while ensuring that resources are available. The assembly will have to define its attitude to the review of the common agricultural policy, and that will have to reflect the needs and priorities of Wales, including the role and value of the family farm. The assembly will also have to work ceaselessly in favour of the right review, for which the Tir Cymen scheme is a prototype. That scheme should be extended to the whole of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has to say about the assembly's attitude towards farming in Wales, but what will the assembly be able to do for farming in Wales that the current Government cannot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without going into detail, I was referring to the assembly's ability to define the precise needs of Wales as they relate to the CAP review. That is just one example of what the assembly will do, and we will need to bring pressure to bear to achieve that. The assembly will have some discretion on agri-environmental schemes and on the use of financial resources for particular types of economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the case for using some economic development funds for the agri-environment scheme. I hope that will come to fruition shortly, although there is talk of postponing it until the Royal Welsh show. The scheme needs to be properly funded to make a difference. There will be every justification to spend an additional £6 million or £7 million to begin to build a new base for sustainable agriculture in Wales. The Secretary of State shakes his head pessimistically, but the money that I am talking about is nothing compared with the £240 million spent on LG.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new economic development agency must acknowledge the central role of agriculture in economic policy, possibly by promoting co-operation between farmers to market and develop the type of new products that Professor Midmore calls vertical integration. Such co-operation is a prerequisite for the economic success of the family farm. A document on the present crisis that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
has been produced by four principal Welsh economists, including Professor Gareth Wyn Jones—an acknowledged expert—describes the 10 key elements that form a strategy. Although I approve of all 10 points, time is short so I shall refer to just one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand that we are on the threshold of a revolution in energy production. The process of production and distribution has been decentralised in a radical way. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) referred to the production of bio-energy, the development of which will give farmers an opportunity to grow new crops for new markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A power station with a capacity of between 15 and 25MW could provide £5 million for the local economy and could create 50 long-term, stable jobs, in addition to jobs that would be safeguarded on farms to plant and gather in crops. I understand that, in terms of climate and land, Wales is ideal for such developments. New and important decisions will be taken by MAFF and the DTI over the next few months and I hope that the Welsh Office will bring great pressure to bear for decisions that will benefit Wales. I shall brief the Welsh Office on such developments if it wants. We must take a constructive attitude towards the sustainable and renewable energy sector, in which great opportunities exist for rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The status of Wales under the European structural funds will be vital. Again, important decisions for Wales will be taken over the next few months. The importance for Wales of being granted objective 1 status is obvious. The depth of the present crisis should clinch the matter. The question is whether the British Government—and the DTI and the Treasury in particular—support our application. Will they press the Welsh case for objective 1 status? If so, there should be no problem in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are on test for their credibility in Wales. First, they must respond adequately and quickly to the present crisis; secondly, they must set a foundation on which the assembly can build to create a prosperous economy and society for the future. It can be done, and we must aim towards that. A number of key decisions must be taken over the next few months. I hope that the Government will show today in the town of Carmarthen that they are ready for that challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I start, I should like to repeat your words of thanks, Mr. Jones, to the Officers of the House and to the chairman, members and officers of Carmarthenshire for making the facilities available to us. Although it is not my responsibility, I apologise to members of the Committee for the difficulty that we experienced earlier with simultaneous translation. I shall ensure that a detailed explanation is available to hon. Members and that everything is done to ensure that there is no repetition of what happened this morning at further sittings. However, I have no doubt that the circumstances were beyond anyone's control. I hope that that explanation and apology are accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Farmers Union of Wales, the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association for their presentations this morning, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
have ensured that all Committee members are aware of the nature and the scale of the problems that our rural communities face. In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Ceredigion ensured that the message was not lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government acknowledge the problems of the countryside; we would be foolish not to. I also want to acknowledge tint the Government have a responsibility to respond to those problems. I shall not say that it is not a matter for Government and that we can leave it to the market. A Government who were elected, as we were, with a clear manifesto and who acknowledge those problems must accept responsibility. However, the debate has not been helped by the rather silly suggestion—not that the hon. Member for Ceredigion made it—that the Government are somehow responsible for all the current problems. That is manifestly not the case—we have been in office for only 12 months. Some of our problems, such as BSE, the state of the rural economy and the run-down conditions of public services, are the direct result of the policies that were followed from 1979. We have a huge task to turn them round. They cannot be turned round, however well motivated we are, in the space of 12 months. Other problems that we must deal with, such as the enlargement of the European Union and the high pound, are not the previous Government's responsibility but the result of international or global influences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that all the responsibility does not rest with the present Government for the mess in the agricultural sector, particularly with regard to BSE, which was inherited from the previous Government. However, will the Secretary of State accept that it will be his and his Government's responsibility to secure objective 1 status for Wales? That rests with the Government and the Welsh Office, and the people of Wales expect it to be delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman looks at my remarks in 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will see that I have acknowledged that the Government have a responsibility. As he knows, because he follows this matter closely, we are making strenuous representations at the moment. I intend to ensure that the Government do all that they can to safeguard the position of Wales. However, it is not a matter that is in my gift alone, or that of the Government; we must work our way through a range of negotiations. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that no stone will be left unturned in our search for the success which he knows I am after and I know he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have acknowledged the Government's responsibility. Many of these problems are long term, so the responses must be long term. However, given the immediate pressures, people will understandably say that they do not want to wait: there must be a more immediate response. I shall say how we propose to tackle it in a moment, but first I want to put this debate in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems for the countryside are not only about the immediate problem of farm incomes, but go much wider. For example, as emerged earlier in our proceedings, our poor inter-regional communications foster economic and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
social isolation. That does not help. Poor acceptability hampers the spread of economic development throughout Wales. There is an imbalance in the age structure because of the outward migration of young people. In some areas, three quarters of the population live in dispersed communities of fewer than 2,000 people. Communities are struggling to survive because of a lack of basic services to sustain them. There continue to be tensions between the need for economic growth and the responsibility placed on communities to protect our precious natural heritage. Those are all deep-rooted, long-term, structural problems, which are quite separate from the more immediate problem of farm incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are now fewer jobs, a fundamental reliance is placed on agriculture for employment, and incomes are falling. By and large, we have a low GDP, relatively low incomes and low rates of economic activity, all of which compound the problems of the countryside. Welsh communities also have a unique responsibility for supporting a culture and a language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agriculture faces great difficulty, but I want to put it in context. I have seen reports suggesting that incomes dropped by 90 per cent. between 1996 and 1997. I should like to be able to blame that drop on the previous Government, but this is one of the few occasions when I shall leap to their defence. That suggested drop is not a true representation of the case. The figures are based on an unrealistic assumption that any income fall is borne entirely by the principal farmer, not by all those with an entrepreneurial interest in the farm. More representative figures are those for total income from farming, which show a fall—the hon. Member for Ceredigion was right—of 43 per cent. between 1996 and 1997. Clearly we have a major problem on our hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am equally conscious of the economic multiplier effect of agriculture in the rural community. The Welsh Institute of Rural Studies on LSA policy in Wales, using estimates from 1991, states that every on-farm job in the milk production sector, for example, sustains 0.25 per cent. jobs elsewhere and in the cattle and sheep sectors 0.35 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reply to the charge that the Welsh Office has decided to cut agricultural spending. In the most recent Welsh questions, the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) suggested that we had cut spending in 1998–99 by 18 per cent. He referred to the figures in the departmental report, which reflect not the provision in the block but the projected expenditure on European Union CAP schemes and HLCAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three factors distort that position. First, the figures for 1997–98 were artificially inflated by the inclusion of £12.2 million of agri-money compensation, which was paid last year. No decision has been taken for 1998–99 in that respect, so no corresponding figure is included in the sums for the current financial year. Any comparison is therefore misleading. Secondly, the sheep annual premium has been reduced for 1998–99, for which neither the Welsh Office nor the British Government have any discretion. Such decisions are taken within the context of European Union rules. Thirdly, the figures for 1997-98 show an increase of £9.5 million in HCLAs, which was part of the previous Government's compensation for BSE. Those figures were in the previous year's departmental
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
report but, of course, are not in the current year's departmental report. An initial reading would suggest that there has been a fall of 18 per cent., but I want to make it clear to the Committee that that reduction does not reflect the reality, the decision or the desire of the Welsh Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that a classic example of the Labour Government slavishly following the previous Government's policies? They did not allow for the compensation of the beef industry in the second year; the need was there but the Government did not respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That charge is unjustified; we responded last year. The Government must consider these matters carefully. I understand that agri-money is available, and the accusation that we have not accessed the money available in Europe to support the beef sector is not true. We accessed virtually all of that money to assist the beef sector, and a considerable percentage of the money available for sheep was accessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem—which was referred to by the hon. Member for Ceredigion—is the Fontainebleau agreement. Even when we access money from the agri-money compensation, the British taxpayer has to pay 71 per cent. of it. It is not a pot of gold from Brussels; 71 per cent. of it is paid for by people in rural communities and by people working in industry or the public services. They must pay their taxes, and we must be careful when we use that money to support the agriculture industry. I am not saying that we should not do so, but that a balanced judgment must be made. It is unreasonable to put the interests of one sector above those of everybody else. Such judgments are what government is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has partly answered a question that I was going to ask about agri-money compensation. We would like to know, at some point,when that compensation is likely to be paid. The next tranche is much needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Secretary of State's point about the Fontainebleau agreement, it is accepted that part of that money will have to be met by the taxpayer. He and his colleagues have painted themselves into a corner. They have made a pact with the devil—they have decided that they will stick to the previous Government's spending plans—and therefore cannot budge at all. I suggest to the Secretary of State that the average person living in a rural area would pay more tax rather than see the area decimated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to re-run the general election, but we have not made a pact with the devil—I know that the hon. Gentleman likes to use dramatic language. Prior to the general election, we said that it would be unreasonable for us to introduce a whole range of public spending commitments before we had a chance to look at the books. We took that decision before the election, and the British people decided that that was a pretty reasonable thing to do. We said that we would commit ourselves to living within the total spending limits
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
for the first two years while we assessed the position and undertook a comprehensive spending review to decide how best to put money into our priorities. Two Budgets have been introduced since then, the first of which put £3.5 billion into the new deal. Much of that properly came to Wales and 2,000 jobs for young people have been created. An extra £180 million was put into education and the health service over and above those spending limits. Last year, we found £80 million of compensation to support the agriculture industry. The hon. Gentleman does not further the cause of rational debate by suggesting that the Government can go around obtaining money. We are debating the rural economy and all hon. Members will say that we should put more money into agri-money compensation. If we were debating education, all hon. members would say that we should put more money into education if we were debating the health service, all hon. Members would say that we should put more money into the health service. The Government are rational and must make difficult choices. Those are not clichés and I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that there is no question of a pact with the devil. The Government are dealing with a difficult inheritance. We want to create stable economic conditions for sustained economic growth and to put resources into the public sector. We are concerned about problems as and when they arise—witness the support that we have given to agriculture—but such support must be part of a package. If we were to start spraying money around, we would not last long as a Government and would provide no long-term benefit to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion referred to the level of sterling and I accept that it is having a depressing effect on farm incomes. I certainly acknowledge the worries of exporters and farmers about the current level of the pound. The hon. Gentleman referred to a mantra chanted by my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but it is in the long-term interests of everyone to ensure stable economic conditions in this country. The years of boom and bust have done us no good at all. The hon. Member of Ceredigion said that we need a little more boom, but if we returned to inflation and rising unemployment, the first people to suffer would be people in the more remote, poorer communities in Wales. It is in our interests to have a growing, sustainable economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue will remain a matter of difference between us, but I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion understands that the Government are acting in good faith. As the year progresses and the impact of the single currency works its way through the money market, we shall see what happens to interest rates and the level of the pound, but I acknowledge that I am very conscious of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Union of Wales and the Country Landowners Association believe that £416 million is available and that the Government should claim that money. Will he tell the Committee whether the Government will claim all, part or none of that £416 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman does not bring much to our discussion. It is not a question of the Government claiming that money. There is no pot of money available for me or any other Minister to bring home. The sums to which he refers are broken down between all sectors: beef, milk, cereals, sugar, sheep and the agri-environment. They are phased over three years and the British Government, via the British taxpayer, must fund 71 per cent. of any part of the 50 per cent. which the European Union might pay. It is not a question of just taking the money. We must make a careful judgment on whether it is reasonable for us to access the one third that is available for cereals. The cereal sector, in comparison with the livestock sector, has done reasonably well and if the hon. Gentleman is saying that the Government should obtain from the European Union a further £130 million for cereal producers knowing that 71 per cent. of that would have to come from the pockets of hard-pressed workers in my constituency, he would not find much support. On the other hand, the beef sector is entitled to £60 million over three years and we accessed virtually all of that last year. Only £700,000 is available for the sheep sector throughout the United Kingdom and that will not make a huge difference. The hon. Gentleman does not further the cause of rational political debate by assuming that we can collect and give our large sums of money at no cost to the British taxpayer. I hope that I have dealt with that matter because I want to move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State; I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, £318 million is available over three years for milk, which is a hard pressed sector in Wales. It seems to me that there is good reason, in terms of the knock-on effects of the decision, for accessing that money, as well as the money that is available for beef—£82 million over three years, according to figures from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government obviously have to consider those matters, but it is not the case that £200 million is available because British taxpayers must find 71 per cent. of that figure. The hon. Gentleman must say whether he wants the Government to cut other areas of public expenditure to meet that target or whether he is in favour of increased taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about misconceptions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is being fair and direct if he says that the answer is to increase taxes, but the Government believe that the time is inappropriate for the large-scale tax increases that would be required. That is a political difference between us. I personally believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
that it is in the long-term interests of the Welsh economy to have a period of stability and economic growth because that is the only way to address the twin problems of the Welsh economy: unacceptably high economic inactivity and unacceptably low GDP in income. I do not believe that the Welsh economy will benefit from raising taxes as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of BSE has not yet been raised, but it is a critical factor. It is one of the darkest clouds that hangs over agriculture and has had a profound effect on farming, certainly for the past two years but, I believe, for much longer than that. Farming is not an industry that can react effectively to a sudden drop in demand for its product. Calves continue to grow, and need to be fed and cared for, and farmers must accept responsibility for that. That is why the Government have given farmers so much help—£2.5 billion so far. That is a considerable amount of money which could have been used for other purposes, and it is a matter of great regret to me that such an enormous amount of public money had to be squandered in such a way because the whole BSE crisis could have been avoided if the Conservative Government had acted properly 10 years ago. Despite the fact that they were warned time after time, they turned a deaf ear to the warnings, and when they did react, they did so in an ineffective and incompetent way. So the nation has had to provide a lot of money to support farmers and, in the current financial year, a further £700 million will go to meet the costs of BSE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the prospect of common agricultural policy reform, through the Agenda 2000 programme. That inevitably adds to the uncertainty faced by farmers at the moment. The CAP must change; everyone realises that continuing as we are is not an option. I was surprised, as well as shocked and worried, to realise that the value of subsidy for livestock farmers in less favoured areas is twice the net farm income. That is a stunning statistic. Alongside that, there has been a drop in farm incomes; farmers are actually worse off. There has been a drop in employment, a drop in the quality of fanning and a drop in the quality of the environment, so we are not achieving what we want to achieve even though we are investing so much money. In addition, prices for our foodstuffs, particularly meat and milk products, are way above world prices. We are not getting what we want out of the CAP, so changes must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that my colleagues in the Committee will say that those are long-term changes and farmers will say that it is no good having a long-term agenda for change because, unless we take short-term action, we will not have any farmers or farms to benefit from those long-term changes. I understand that. The Government have taken some short-term action, and I shall remind the Committee of the further steps that will be taken. A question was asked this morning about the Meat and Livestock Commission. The Government have spent £2 million on a special marketing campaign to boost the demand for British beef.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I referred to Government spending aimed at shielding the industry from the effects of BSE. In addition, the Government are doing everything possible to persuade our European partners to lift the beef export ban. That is at the heart of getting the industry right, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
I am pleased that the export certified herd scheme has been agreed by the European Union. The scheme applies only to Northern Ireland at present because it needs computerised traceability, but we are working on getting the date-based scheme accepted. That remains a very high priority, and I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), will have something to report from his recent meeting with the Agriculture Council in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a proposal to be adopted allowing the export of animals born after 1 August 1996, provided that they are more than six months and less than 30 months old and have been traceable all their lives, either by passport or by computer records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past financial and calendar year, the Government provided £85 million of additional agri-money compensation for Britain's beef and sheep producers, in recognition of the special problems that they have encountered. The Welsh share of that compensation was £12.2 million, more than what would be determined on a simple per capita basis—because, as the Committee knows, we have more sheep in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of that money has now been paid to farmers. Questions were asked earlier about the Welsh Office's efficiency in making those payments. I have taken the necessary steps to resolve that problem once and for all. The Welsh Office's poor performance in paying out those subsidies has been legendary in the Welsh farming industry, and I hope that the steps that I have taken will resolve that problem in the medium term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agri-compensation meant that about £2,000 extra went into the pocket of the average Welsh upland farmer. That is not a bad compensation package. It does not answer all the problems, but it shows that, by making such a sum available, the Government are not turning their back on the matter. That money will make a real difference to farmers' cash flow and income, and will help alleviate the problems that I described earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiatives that I have outlined have been taken by the British Government. I assure the Committee that I make sure that the Welsh dimension is taken into account in discussions, but certain matters can be dealt with in a Welsh context as well. The new relationship in Wales means that the problems faced by farmers can be discussed with representatives of the industry and thereby resolved. That happens on a regular basis: for example, I have had 15 official meetings—and countless informal ones—with representatives of the farming unions in Wales. I do not think that my Conservative predecessor met them once. That shows how much the situation has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Wales are developing our own agrienvironmental scheme. People say that a lot more money needs to be put into the scheme. However, we have to get it up and running. I am not ashamed to say that it is important to get the principles right. Once we have achieved that, Wales will have something that is approved by Europe and will be in the best position to take advantage of the reforms of the common agriculture policy under the Agenda 2000 programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such developments do not happen overnight. We need to have modest aspirations: I have no problem with that, as long as we ensure that we fulfil those aspirations and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
secure a basis on which to work. We are redeveloping a Welsh food strategy, for example by building stronger food supply chains and examining the existing structure. I am conscious that further change is necessary. At present, I am having discussions with Welsh Food Promotions and the Welsh Development Agency. I hope that I will make a major statement in the not too distant future about the reorganisation and improvements that I want to secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that will require a lot of hard work, which I and my colleagues will continue to provide. However, I am aware that it is not enough to talk only about farming and farm incomes. They form a substantial part of the problems faced by our rural communities, but they are not the only element. We need to do much more, especially if we are to develop a more balanced and diverse economy. That will require a dual approach: we must attract new investors to the area and make available comprehensive and effective services to help indigenous businesses to prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion talked about the £240 million that has gone to LG. That will provide an immediate and enormous boost to the economy of south-east Wales. However, there is no reason why the spin-off from that cannot have a widespread impact throughout Wales. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the Welsh Development Agency and I are working hard to ensure that we get that benefit. If we are determined and imaginative, we can make sure that that money benefits the whole of Wales and not just the south-east corner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must seek out and attract businesses that will be in sympathy with the characteristics of our rural areas and that can build on and prosper from their many strengths. Revised guidance for Wales will make clear that a greater range of industries can be successfully located in rural areas without causing unacceptable disturbance. If we are sufficiently imaginative, we can ensure that, as technological change works through, we can take advantage of the opportunities given by our rural communities to diversify the local economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many mobile businesses, for example, offer good employment opportunities. The location of those opportunities requires an efficient telecommunications network, but the traditional constraints of access and peripherality do not apply. Such firms must be targeted, because they represent realistic and potentially highly rewarding investors in rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the time and want to get on to the other announcement that I wish to make. I assure the Committee that, on matters such as welfare to work, tourism and transport, the Government have many initiatives and are taking the problems seriously. We are trying to ensure that we have a response to the problems that exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been modest about his own record in being far-sighted and in anticipating the BSE crisis in an Adjournment debate in the 1980s. Had action been taken then, we would not have the crisis that we face now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that a future crisis in agriculture would be one that relates to consumer worries about pollution and the excessive use of pesticides,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
nitrates and, especially, the antibiotics that are used as growth promoters? Does he agree that the future of Welsh agriculture will be secure if we can change its image so that it is seen as producing products that are free of pollution and which are environmentally sustainable and sound?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of what my hon. Friend says is correct. Much of Welsh agriculture has a reputation for being good and wholesome and much of it, if not organic in a technical sense, has gone a long way to using organic systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must do two things. First, we must work hard to make sure that we produce and process food in a way that builds up our reputation for good, wholesome, healthy and tasty food. Secondly, however, we must project that fact and raise the image of Wales and the distinctiveness of Welsh products by marketing them properly. I am working on those twin initiatives and the assembly will enable us to devote more effort to developing a brand image for not only Welsh agriculture products, but the other things that we sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention the institutional framework briefly because the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) questioned me on it. The national advisory group is considering the institutional framework and will make recommendations on the nature of the committee structure and the system of regional committees. I want to make sure that the structure of the economic powerhouse is compatible with the ultimate institutional framework for the assembly. I am looking closely at that. Although the new powerhouse will not be able to intervene directly in agriculture, I hope that it will be able to play a much more vigorous role in food marketing and in agri-businesses than it was hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have expressed concern about the future of the Development Board for Rural Wales after the creation of the new powerhouse. I hope that I will be able to persuade them that, far from losing the expertise and experience of the Development Board for Rural Wales, the changes will substantially strengthen the range and level of service on offer. For the first time, it will be possible to develop a single, coherent set of policies and programmes for the whole of Wales that is tailored specifically to meet rural needs. The enlarged Welsh Development Agency will work in partnership with other local players to deliver the assembly's strategic economic development objectives. Following the merger, a rural policy unit, to be located in mid Wales, will be established within the Welsh Development Agency. It will provide an effective interface with a wide range of rural interests and stimulate new ideas and innovative approaches to economic development in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months, I have received many representations about boundaries. I have given much thought to the regional organisation of the Welsh Development Agency and of other bodies concerned with our industrial and economic development. I have listened especially carefully to representations from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy who, together with many others, has pressed the case for retaining Meirionnydd
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
within the mid Wales area of the Welsh Development Agency. However, as he will realise, many people have expressed the opposite view. Following my Department's public consultation exercise, I have decided that four regions should be established for the Welsh Development Agency, and that they should share common boundaries with the training and enterprise councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Development Agency's existing north Wales region will be retained, as will the DBRW's area, including Meirionnydd, which will become the WDA's mid Wales region. In order to achieve common boundaries, Meirionnydd will transfer from the north Wales training and enterprise council area, and Ceredigion will transfer from the west Wales TEC area. Both will be added to the area of the existing Powys TEC to form a new mid Wales TEC. I assure the Committee that that arrangement reflects the feelings of the local community. A slight incongruity of boundaries results from it, because the whole of Gwynedd is now outside the north Wales TEC area. That is the exception that proves the general rule that there should not be coterminosity of boundaries. I hope that nobody—in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend—now thinks that he can come to me and argue that it is a precedent that should be applied elsewhere. In the south, the new south-west region and the residual west Wales TEC area will include the unitary authority areas of Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, and Neath Port Talbot. Bridgend will now feature in the south-east Wales region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the boards of the relevant TECs to take the necessary steps to bring the new arrangements into being by April 1999. The arrangements will help to achieve greater synergy between the largest business support agencies in Wales and reduce confusion and duplication in terms of the services on offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, we face a complex range of issues that affect many interested parties. I was delighted with the rural partnership for Wales initiative that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend launched on 12 March. Because of the nature of Wales, there is scarcely a Welsh constituency without a rural dimension. We in the Welsh Office are conscious of that. The countryside is important to Wales—for the food that it produces, for the environment that it creates, for the culture that it sustains, and for the men and women who earn their living from working in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with all the problems, we need a Government who understand the nature of the task and are committed to responding to it. The Government realise that short-term action is necessary. We will do all that we can to alleviate problems in the short term, while recognising that a long-term strategy is also necessary. It would not be beneficial to respond in a way that buys time today, but ignores the problems of the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure for me to be in the Welsh Grand Committee today. I remember standing outside the county hall in Mold 12 months ago shouting, "Please let me in". There is no truth in the rumour that today I have been standing at the doors of the county hall in Carmarthen shouting,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
"Please let me out". It is important that the 317,000 people who voted Conservative in Wales in the 1997 general election have their voice on the Welsh Grand Committee, because that is the second largest number of votes that was cast for any political party in Wales. The Secretary of State said that he does not wish to see a re-run of the general election. I suspect that many other people would like to see that, but with a different result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the election, farmers and other members of the rural community, students, pensioners and home owners have come to feel let down. They have seen mortgage increases and five interest rate rises in 12 months. If that trend continues for the next four years, we shall all be in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the problem that interest rate rises have created for farmers and their bank managers. Farmers have had tremendous problems managing the debt that has grown over the past few years for all sorts of reasons. For example, European Community hygiene regulations have proved particularly expensive to comply with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion said the Government's credibility is on trial. I cannot agree more. They are being closely monitored by those who live in, work in, visit and enjoy rural areas and communities. On 25 March, the 	<i>Western Mail</i> ran an article under the headline
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rural Wales is on brink of deep recession".</p></blockquote>
Since then, things have got worse for the farming community. That is why I raised the question of the future of Welsh and British farmers during the next 12 months if they are not given real help. One does not need the assistance of Mystic Meg to work out the fate of rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that this is a listening Government. However, they do not act on the representations and pleas that are made to them. Through me the Farmers Union of Wales, the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association made such a representation this morning, so when the Secretary of State for Wales had a go at me he in fact attacked those three organisations, which want him to do exactly what I asked him to do. I am sure that their members will take careful note of the characteristically high-and-mighty manner in which he reprimanded me. Theirs is a heartfelt plea. The health of agriculture is vital to the health of the rural economy. One cannot allow the heart of the rural economy to stop beating and expect everything else to be all right—when the heart stops, so does everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr held up a newspaper that claimed that a £16 million shopping centre is to be built in his constituency. However, that will not solve the problems that confront the farmers in his constituency. The shelves of the new shopping mall will no doubt be furnished with cheap imports because of the strong pound. Manufacturers in Wales are also suffering because of the strong pound. They cannot export their goods because those of our European Union neighbours are currently more competitively priced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Farmers face a similar difficulty. Cheap imports from France, Germany and Ireland will no doubt be sold in the butcher's department of the shopping centre supermarket. Those imports will compete with goods that are produced on our own doorstep. New supermarkets are therefore not the sole answer to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the previous Government changed their policy on supermarket planning and regulation. I should declare an interest, as I have a small retail outlet in Swansea that has been on the same premises for 60 years. We compete with the supermarkets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supermarkets have a role, but that will not answer the deep structural problems that confront farmers in Wales. Building more supermarkets will not help Welsh farmers, British manufacturers or rural Wales. The Country Landowners Association have told us about the ripple effect that is caused by the problem confronting Welsh farmers. Farmers with heavy debts think twice before spending money on their farms, on new tractors, on capital goods and on farm repairs. They even think carefully about buying feedstuffs for their animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about a landscape that has been moulded and crafted by generations of Welsh farmers, who must now confront the vital question of whether they will continue to exist in the new millennium. We are supposed to look forward to 2000, but as the hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr knows, farming families are asking themselves whether they will still be in business then. A number of farmers will go out of business unless the Government undertake genuine action and change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our heritage in Wales contains the blood, sweat and tears of many farming families. Never before have those families been asked to give so much blood, so much sweat and so many tears. they receive nothing from the Government in return. The Government do not understand the farming fraternity and the rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The value of the pound is one of the most serious problems confronting farmers. Everyone has skirted around the issue of the euro and the single currency, but a fudge has taken place. People have switched from their own currencies into the pound because of fears about that fudge. The pound has appreciated in value for a long time, and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Farmers are unable to compete with cheap goods from abroad. They make pleas to the Government, who are not prepared to take action to assist them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have heard the call from Plaid Cymru, which is a high taxation party. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire is not here at the moment, but at the general election the Liberal Democrat solution to problems was to increase direct taxation. That is an unsatisfactory answer, and that is why Plaid Cymru got less than 10 per cent. of the popular vote at the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We go four seats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that Plaid Cymru got four seats. The Conservative party got 317,000 votes in Wales—almost twice the number that Plaid Cymru received—but I accept that the targeting of the votes gave the party its four seats. That does not quieten the voice of the 317,000 people who voted Conservative. Plaid Cymru Members should take it on board that the answer to people's problems is not necessarily to increase taxation, and that other options should be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When farmers' land goes up for sale, people have to disperse and move away from their communities. The Secretary of State said that people in Wales live in dispersed villages and towns, in small numbers. I accept that; but it is one of the strengths of Wales. It should not be changed. We do not wish to witness the depopulation of rural areas. We should ensure that the quality of life that rural people have enjoyed continues. They should not start to go to big cities, far away from where they were brought up and from where their history is, to make a living. As farms disappear, the village school is threatened. If the school closes, problems arise with other services, and with the infrastructure that has been built up around the towns and villages, including bus services, and local doctors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must ensure that a lifeline is given to local communities and that their quality of life can be improved. The Committee has heard about many areas where such problems exist from the Country Landowners Association, the National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have also heard quite a bit from the Secretary of State about BSE, and he will remember the House of Commons debates. Matthew Parris put it perfectly in a newspaper column. He wrote that the Secretary of State for Social Security and Minister for Women said that the industry was hanging by a thread, and he added that she went on to cut it. The policies did a lot of damage to the farming industry. Problems have been heaped on agriculture since then. Beef on the bone is just the most recent aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one debate in the House, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food did not attend. he was not away in Brussels, fighting on behalf of Welsh farmers. Not only did he not attend, but he was in the Smoking Room, during debate about the impact of banning beef on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

With regard to the beef on the bone problem, the Agriculture Minister does not seem to care enough to attend a debate in the House of Commons, on the issues for which he is responsible. We are still waiting to hear what will happen to green top milk. I am not sure that I am the best advertisement for healthy eating, but I have a bottle of green top milk delivered to my door every day when I stay in my Constituency home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about the strong pound. We need action to alleviate the problems of cheap imports. I remember asking a private notice question at the time of demonstrations by Welsh farmers, who wanted the Government to take notice of their plight. Unfortunately, as I said, their pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the over-30-months scheme, the fact that dead-weight limits have been introduced on lower prices as well means that many farmers who are already suffering due to B SE—we all accept that—are now getting a lot less money for their animals, which has had an important impact on their incomes. The banks will take all that on board when they look at the balance sheets. They will also note that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard that the Government are not claiming all that they can, although I fully understand the Secretary of State's point about our having to pay 71p for every pound that we get back because of our rebate. However, other European countries are in receipt of aid that we give, because we are a net contributor to the European Union. We are therefore helping the Spanish farmer, the French farmer and the German farmer, but we are not helping—as we should—the British farmer and the Welsh farmer from the available compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labelling is another problem. British and Welsh consumers want to know where their meat comes from. We have to do more to ensure that consumers have more information about the origins of the produce that they buy. I believe that they want to support home-grown industries. There is a further problem, arising from the gap between perception and reality. While we all recognise that, irrespective of what figures we use, farmers' incomes have dropped dramatically, consumers do not see that reflected in the price of milk or meat in the supermarket. That is part of the farmers' difficulty in getting their message across to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enormous march in London on 1 March was not only about country pursuits and sports. A number of farmers from Wales were there, pleading with the Government to listen to the countryside. As we drive around Wales and the rest of Britain, we can see posters in farmers' fields pleading with consumers and the Government to listen to their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the banks seem to be supporting farmers and the farming industry, but there will come a time when they say that they can support the farmers' loans for only a limited time. When they start to call the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
money in and force farms to be sold, the crisis, depression and recession that are hitting the farming fraternity and about which the newspapers talk will become much deeper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk a lot about diversification to farmers in Britain. Perhaps they mean giving up farms or giving them over to supermarket development and extra houses, but that is not what I call diversification. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of tourists come to Wales just to experience and enjoy the natural beauty of our countryside. I grew up around Swansea and travelled around the Gower area. I enjoyed the heritage, but it is not just for me and my family and it is not just for the past; it should be retained and enlivened, and it should flourish for future generations. We have a responsibility to ensure that that comes about, but we can do so only by listening to what farmers and their organisations have to say about the current crisis and by acting. It is about time the Government acted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although this is a debate on rural affairs, I want to discuss agriculture. Those Committee members who are agriculture experts may raise an eyebrow at that. I represent Llanelli, which is part of Carmarthenshire, and I believe that it is also part of the south-west region that extends from Neath and Port Talbot to Pembrokeshire. The rural economy and the agriculture of west Wales obviously affect my constituents and that region. Moreover, Mr. Huw Richards, who spoke at an earlier meeting, is a constituent of mine, which is another good reason for discussing agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two constituents of mine, who—believe it or not—farm 60 or 70 acres in Llanelli, provided the catalyst for my speech. Wales, especially rural Wales, is a matriarchal society, and it is usually the lady of the family who makes the point that husband and wife have discussed. The lady of the farm rang me the other day and asked some very interesting questions. She told me—I gather correctly—that the price that she gets for a gallon of milk has dropped by about 20 per cent. over the past year. She added, "They say, Mr. Davies, that is because of the high value of the pound. But I do not sell any milk to Europe. My milk, as far as I am aware, is collected by Milk Marque," which is a ridiculously named organisation. She continued, "My milk is certainly not sent to Europe. Why should they say that the price of milk has dropped by 20 per cent. because of the high value of the pound? I am not in the business of exporting." She asked a rational and pertinent question which is not easy to answer."

Years ago, there was a civil servant at the Treasury who understood the intricacies of the green pound. I believe that after a few years he went mad. No doubt someone at the Treasury today understands the intricacies of the green pound and may brief Welsh Office Ministers from time to time. I hope that he does not go mad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to explain to the lady farmer that prices were fixed in an odd currency that is presently called the ecu, which may in future be called the euro. I do not want to make a speech about the common agricultural policy, but it is absurd that the price of milk in west Wales, which is not exported anywhere and most of which is probably drunk in west Wales, is affected by the price or the value of the pound on the foreign exchanges, but that is the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not tell the lady, because I did not want to depress her, even further, that in the current financial year Britain will contribute £3.4 billion, across the exchanges, to the European Union budget. That is after we have taken account of all the splendid projects that we see around, to which European money has contributed. It is net: it is after taking into account the Fontainebleau agreement. This year £3.5 billion will go from Britain to other countries of the European Union. It is difficult to have any concept of so much money, but £3.4 billion is almost half the Welsh Assembly's likely annual budget of £7 billion. That £3.4 billion goes to all the other countries that pay in but are not net contributors to the Community—France, Denmark, Holland and all the countries that take more out because they have a larger agricultural sector than we do. Ireland is one of them, although I did not want to pour salt on the wounds by mentioning it. I am told that Ireland is covered in golf courses built with money from the European Union. Therefore, a taxpayer's money—my constituent' s money, if she pays tax on her low income—goes across the exchanges to assist the farmers of other countries. Again, I thought I had better not explain that to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the lady said, "I went to Tesco the other day to shop, Mr. Davies"—this has been mentioned in the debate—"and when I saw the price of meat sold there"—it was probably beef; she does not sell a large amount of beef, but people have to sell livestock—"and I compared it to the price that we get at Carmarthen mart, I shuddered." That made her even more despondent. I thought again that I had better not say too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not ask the lady to look in Tesco's annual report at the exorbitant sums paid to its directors and senior management. I did not tell her that the City needs more and more, higher and higher dividends. I did not tell her the rate of profit of the large British supermarkets is far greater than that of German supermarkets and, indeed, American supermarkets, which are more efficient, have more choice and are more competitive. I did not tell her that, although Milk Marque may be sent to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Tesco will not be, because Tesco and Sainsbury are now respectable: they have purchased into the establishment. I might have said to her, "You might be able to case your next vote in Tesco when you buy that expensive meat", but I thought I should not be provocative. I shall save provocation for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Committee. I do not have an answer to these problems, but if we want an answer, we must try to analyse the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the farming communities are worried about the change in the CAP. I do not know what will happen to the CAP. There is something called Agenda 2000. We have heard before about the reform of the CAP. I hope that on this occasion there will be some reform of it. I shall return to the consequences in a moment. Perhaps the Polish cavalry will be able to do to the CAP what none of the vested interests that sit around the table in the Council of Agriculture Ministers want to do, with the exception of my right hon. and hon. Friends. The Poles were very brave and fought great battles. Perhaps this will be their major contribution to the European economy. Perhaps Poland, and the great Hungarian plain that comes in eventually, will bust apart this system, which has outlived its usefulness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Poles do not bust the CAP, perhaps the World Trade Organisation will. Who knows? The WTO has dealt with the Uruguay round and the general agreement on tariffs and trade round in 1994— obviously it will take on the CAP before long, with the huge American agri-companies behind it. I understand from my farming friends that the Americans are determined to move into the European market with their large companies—if they can break the CAP. Perhaps, therefore, a combination of the Poles and the World Trade Organisation will do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion mentioned his constituents, who, in despair, are leaving for Canada. It is not for me to comment on that, but again my farming friends tell me that the American agri-companies, moving into Wisconsin, where a great deal of milk is produced, and other parts of the mid west, can now sell milk in Canada at half the price per gallon that the Canadians can. I do not want to discourage the hon. Gentleman's constituents from leaving—that is a matter for them—but there is no hiding place in our rather cruel global economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, greater problems will ensue. I do not know how the reform of the CAP will work on what will happen. However, even greater problems might ensue for the farming communities of west Wales, which most of us want to progress and prosper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must first try to educate the public about the importance of farming and farming communities. Today we tend to buy our food at the supermarket; a global market exists, and the supermarkets can buy from anywhere they want. We must try to convince people that there is an economic benefit to areas in Wales not only in terms of products sold, but in terms of money spent locally to purchase machinery, for example. I need not labour that point. We must try to convince a populace that does not think about food much, except as something that can be easily bought at the supermarket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that entrepreneurs are good things again. They are now people whom we must foster and look after. We do not have many entrepreneurs in Wales; we never have had. We have looked outside for our inward investment, and I hope that we shall receive more. However, our prospects in the world economy are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
good. Nevertheless, members of the farming community are entrepreneurs, whatever else they may be. They generate wealth; they change and adapt quickly. In considering the Welsh economy and the need for entrepreneurship, we should recognise that they are entrepreneurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been mentioned, the Government have a major part to play in trying to effect and assist the necessary reconstruction. Farmers will have to do something as well. I was going to say that I can now tell the Committee what farmers should do, because Huw Richards is not here, but a little bird tells me that he is. However, I shall say it anyway. It is easy to say, but the pattern of traditional farming that I have seen in north and west Wales may have to change because the market and the CAP will change. Everyone—Government and farmers—must contribute to that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A phenomenon exists called agri-money compensation. I do not know what that means—I suspect that it means golf courses. However, farmers do not want to be managers of golf courses. Carmarthenshire is now covered with golf courses, just as southern Ireland and everywhere else is. If Matthew Arnold were writing today, he would not have said or written:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ploughman homeward plods his weary way".</p></blockquote>
He probably would have said, "The golfer homeward plods his weary way", except that the golfer goes home in a motor car, or so my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) tells me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers do not want to be golf course managers or to run bed-and-breakfast establishments and they do not want to be park keepers. Our suggestions on what to do about farming must be relevant. I know it is not easy, but I believe that fanners should cut their costs. I shall now adopt the mantle of a 19th century Liberal free-marketeer, which accords with the spirit of the age. When I drive around west Wales, I no longer see any cows. I do not know where they are, but I am told that they are in cowsheds guzzling cake, which used to be produced by BOCM, and silage. People no longer grow kale to increase the milk yield because it is easier to keep cattle inside and incur various costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I occasionally watch S4C, and saw a programme about a man called Dai Jones Llanilar, who went around Eryri, which is in Snowdonia, and took some lovely pictures of sheep and lambs. What surprised me was how fat the mountain sheep and lambs have become. Mountain sheep did not used to be as fat as they are now; the lambs used to be lean and the meat sweet. But I am not surprised that they are fat because they were guzzling molasses at such a rate—perhaps they are not sweet any more. That pattern of farming, created by the CAP, fixed prices and the need to produce more—because if prices are fixed, farmers naturally produce more, and if they can use chemicals and high-cost aids that is all right—will probably have to change, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned. It is not organic farming but a kind of traditional pattern of farming, certainly in this part of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Years ago, when I visited my aunts—that shows that Wales, certainly rural Wales, is a matriarchal society—I used to see chickens and pigs in the farmyard. One no
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
longer sees chickens or pigs these days; it is the milking parlour, the long pipe, Milk Marque and the cows. That is the pattern imposed on farmers by the market and the Government. That will have to change, but it can change only if the Government are prepared to help—not just by issuing a few pamphlets and papers but by really considering how to reconstruct Welsh farming to enable it to compete in the next millennium. It will not be easy. The assembly has been mentioned but it will not be a magic wand. The Welsh Development Agency should play a major role in the reconstruction of Welsh agriculture in the light of changes to the CAP and changes to purchasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be done and no easy solution. Change must be carried out by everyone concerned, including the Government. We do not want the Welsh farming industry to go the same way as the Welsh coal industry when the Government stood back and did nothing to attempt a reconstruction. We owe it to our ancestors, to our communities and to the culture and history of our nation to ensure that the farming industry does not die.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pleasing to be here in sunny Carmarthen and in such plush surroundings. The Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, under my chairmanship, resolved to meet as many times as possible in Wales and may be looking to come to Carmarthen in the future. I hope that the slight teething problems with the PA systems will have been solved by then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also pleasing to see our English guests here, who will add a little more fun to the proceedings than we have had hitherto. Our debate is about the rural economy and so far we have focused on farming, to which I would like to refer before the end of my speech. The rural economy also depends on individuals in rural areas, who have been helped by Labour party policies over the past 12 months. They have been helped by the cut in VAT on fuel, the assistance given to pensioners to pay fuel bills, a share of the £5.2 billion to get young people off the dole, a share of the £1.5 billion for the NHS and a share of the £1.3 billion for school buildings. School class sizes will be reduced next year and the minimum wage provision will be of great help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has, for the sake of the environment, had to put extra tax on road fuel, which is a problem in rural areas in terms of transport. However, £50 million has been added to the rural transport grant to provide bus services, which were so viciously cut back in the previous Government's deregulation programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farming, which is the mainstay of the rural economy in most areas in Wales, has four main problems. The first—as the Select Committee recognised, and which I will shortly refer to—is the milk price; the second is land prices; the third is the drop in support help and the green pound; and the fourth is the problems of the beef market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rural economy in Wales has been hit from all sides at once. Who is to blame? The winding up of the Milk Marketing Board is partly to blame for the milk price because it created a deregulated near-monopoly. Land prices and support aid have been affected by high interest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
rates, which were cynically held down by the previous Government. Those high interest rates were released on to an unsuspecting public after 1 May last year because they had to come out. That must be true because the City of London said so; and if it said so that is the reason why they had to come out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on the side of the farmers, but between 1992 and 1996 they were helped by the devaluation of the pound, which was caused by the terrible goings-on of Black Wednesday. Was it Black Wednesday? There were so many black days during the last Tory Government that I cannot remember which day it was. The country lost £11 billion thanks to a previous Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer trying to support the pound within the exchange rate mechanism
There is also a positive side to the present level of interest rates, as there are many retired people in the countryside who are benefiting from higher interest rates on their savings. Although those rates are a huge problem for agriculture, they are not a problem for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any one problem facing us, it is beef. We have heard about the Tory party's incompetence in dealing with BSE, which was a catalogue of disaster from beginning to end. Those of us who have been in Parliament for the past 10 years or so have seen how, at every stage, the Tory Government hoped that the problem would go away—that it just would not happen. Eventually, they realised that they had to do something, but it was too little too late. It was 18 months before they gave compensation for cattle with BSE, and a further 18 months before full compensation was given. I will not go over that ground as it has been gone over so many times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should we do? We have heard a lot today about agri-monetary compensation, which, as my hon. Friend suggested, is not golf courses but money given by national Governments to help sectors within farming that are suffering. The problem is that farming is sectoral. The Government cannot go to Europe and say, "We'll have the £416 million over the next three years." The money is divvied up between the various sectors, as the Secretary of State said happens in the case of wheat. That is not appropriate and diminishes the £416 million straight away. A Government would be foolish not to take the money if it cost them nothing to do so, but the Government are not being foolish because the money is not there. There is so little left in the kitty that the British taxpayer—everybody in the Room, including the farmers, if they still pay tax—still has to give his share. As we have heard, that is 71 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether right hon. and hon. Members missed it, but the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said at Agriculture questions on Thursday that 95 per cent. of the agrimonetary compensation available for beef and 75 per cent. of that for sheepmeat is being paid. Most of the European Union money that can be got has been got. Farmers are already being supported to the tune of £2 billion and more, so, the Government have responded. I should mention the £85 million for the total first-year costs of the cattle movement system. There are also no charges in the first year for new specified risk materials. That is worth £70 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
I am in favour of supporting agriculture. Those members of the Committee who were here for the informal meeting earlier today will recall the answers that farmers would give to steelworkers and mineworkers who had been made redundant because of lack of support for their industries. It struck me that the answer with which steelworkers and mineworkers would agree is jobs. We are talking about 8,000 jobs in agriculture, and we should continue to support it. The Government are supporting agriculture far more than the previous Government supported steel and coal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long-term answer is restoration of the market, primarily through lifting the export ban on beef. We have, however, had a success, which may have been glossed over. The certified herd scheme in Ireland is in place and Europe has accepted it. Our agriculture ministers are working within Europe to get it extended to the rest of the United Kingdom as soon as possible. Opposition will come primarily from the Germans because it suits them for our industry to be in its present position. However, science is on our side. British beef is the safest in Europe—it must be. Whether other countries admit it or not, they have bovine spongiform encephalopathy, although not to the extent that we had it. Our controls, however, protect the British consumer from BSE—at long last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee unanimously decided to consider the crisis in the livestock industry because it was asked to do so by the National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales. What started as a single evidence-taking session has developed into a full-blown report. At every stage, we found more questions to ask of more people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our evidence sessions have turned up evidence that points in several directions. The primary issue is the price spread between what is paid for beef and lamb in the cattle markets and what is charged in supermarkets for plastic packs. I speak as an individual member of the Committee, not on its behalf. So far, however, we have had no explanation for that price spread, and there is scope for an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. I shall put the matter to the Committee, and I know that my colleagues will support me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people might call the price spread profiteering, which is another word for it. We know that the supermarkets, or at least the middle men, have problems with extra costs. If there are extra costs in the middle of the market, however, they are being dumped on farmers. No one else seems to be paying them. That in itself is worthy of further examination. We hope to report on that before Whitsun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to finish on a little bit of good news. Although figures from the Meat and Livestock Commission for the first quarter of this year do not come out until the end of next month, it appears that supermarkets are beginning to source more of their meat from this country. That is good news for the consumer, because it is safer. It is also good news for farmers, because eventually that price will get back to the cattle market. There is, however, more to be done. The safety of British meat should be stressed at every available opportunity by retailers on behalf of their customers and producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
The supermarket in which I shop in Wrexham—I will not name it—is running a promotion called Cig oen Cymraeg. I do not know whether this has anything to do with the fact that we took evidence from that particular group in private session, but the price of beef in that supermarket has gone down. I hope that that is not just a cynical reaction, but that it will continue. I think that it might. The pressure from the farmers outside here today and from the Select Committee investigation will have the same effect. I hope that that pressure will also help to lift the beef ban, which would give the farmers a level playing field and solve their problems in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (	<i>Translation</i>): I wish to speak only briefly. I take the place of my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones), who has unfortunately had to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion in opening the debate. He made a powerful and comprehensive speech, and placed the situation in which rural communities find themselves in the proper context. We have chosen this subject for debate because of the importance of agriculture for our constituencies and for rural Wales in general. We are very much aware of the size of the crisis that we face because we hear about it in our constituency surgeries, week in and week out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Welsh Office is not willing to accept that there has been an 89 per cent. reduction in agricultural incomes, we hope that the Secretary of State will accept that there has been a reduction of between 40 per cent. and 50 per cent. That in itself justifies early and rapid decision making. A farmer spoke to me in February and told me that he had no grazing for his sheep and lambs and could not afford to buy any food for them. They were in danger of dying, but the bank was unwilling to give him any additional money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A family told me that they had farmed the family farm for many years but had had to tell the children that there was no hope of them continuing to farm there; they simply could not continue to keep the farm going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A younger farmer who had started in sheep farming two years ago had bought stock at high cost, interest rates had increased and the prices of lamb and sheep had dropped sharply. He faced serious financial difficulties. Farmers tell us that if they did not have wives who went out to work, it would be impossible for them to keep going. The Government must face up to the crisis and act quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We call for action and full resources from Brussels to compensate for the value of the pound, which is a vital part of the crisis facing Welsh agriculture and, indeed, the economies throughout these islands. If the Government have to pay 71 per cent. of the money that comes as compensation, so be it. We heard the leader of the National Farmers Union saying this morning that if necessary, we should increase taxation to do that. If the leaders of agricultural unions tell the Government to increase taxation, surely the Government must listen. Farmers would be glad to pay income tax, but the fact is that they have no income on which to pay tax. We must have the money through quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
People living in urban areas need food. We are all in this together. In the mid term, however, we need a far wider policy on the value of the pound. We have to lift the ban on beef on the bone, as a matter of urgency. There is some hope that the Veterinary Products Committee, which meets at the end of May, wil show the way, and lead to a change. The matter will take a number of months to work its way through, and it will take some years to come to full fruition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Government's efforts to lift the ban on the export of whole carcasses to France will be successful. We need that ban to be lifted. Prices of lamb are down, and as more animals come to market, they will drop even further. We need the agri-environmental schemes to which my hon. Friend the member for Ceredigion referred. A change is also necessary in the policies adopted by supermarkets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that a depression in agriculture affects the economy of the whole of rural Wales has come through in the Committee. Everything suffers if agriculture suffers, because so much depends on it. The knock-on effects are sometimes sharper than problems in the industry itself. People in businesses selling food, equipment and so on may face bankruptcy before farmers. Shops generally also suffer in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income per head is already low in rural Wales. Gwynedd' s gross domestic product is 72 per cent. of that of Europe and Dyfed's is 68 per cent. The position is even worse in places such as Mid-Glamorgan, where the figure is 61 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those circumstances lead me to emphasise, as I did in an earlier intervention, the importance of ensuring objective 1 status under the European structural funds. Such money has made a difference in Ireland, to which the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) referred. If objective 1 status were to be achieved for the area defined by the Welsh Office, under the new nomenclature of units of territorial statistics 2, it would effect half the Welsh population and £1 billion would be gained between 2002 and 2006. We can imagine the difference that that money could make here in Dyfed, in Gwynedd, in Mid-Glamorgan, and in many industrial areas that suffer from low incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has to be a priority above all else for the Welsh Office, and for everyone in Welsh public life in coming months. We should ask why Wales was not included when the announcement was made in Brussels on March 18. Southern Ireland was accepted and Merseyside confirmed. The Committee knows that Northern Ireland and Scotland are losing out. Wales was, however, simply not there. We went to Brussels and asked about the matter. We discovered that the map for NUTS 2 had not been sent to Brussels, and that people there were saying that unless the map arrived before Easter, Wales would be in danger of losing out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the map? I understand that it was sent to the Office of National Statistics before Easter, and that the ONS is asking questions and sending the map back to the Welsh Office. What is happening with regard to that vital issue? Why has the map not been agreed, and not been sent to Eurostat in Brussels? Unless that is done, there is no hope of receiving the money that is so vital to our economy.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I urge Welsh Office Ministers and everyone involved in the Welsh Office to do everything possible during the coming few months. I call on the Prime Minister himself to give the matter priority, and to ensure that Wales benefits. We are the only part of the United Kingdom that has never had objective 1 status—Northern Ireland, Scotland and England have had it, but we have not. The counties about which I have spoken come within the definition. Their income per head is on average less than 75 per cent. We need the money, and in the circumstances that rural Wales faces, we need it immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my remarks to agricultural problems, although the rural economy comprises many other elements. The agricultural crisis that we have lived through for the past two or three years is of such proportions that I should prefer to devote all of my comments to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know quite where the starting point was. March 1996 was one of the critical milestones, when the link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was announced in the House of Commons. Since, confidence has been lost in the quality of Welsh beef both in Britain and in the European market. Eventually, the ban was imposed. Since then, during 1997-98, matters have become progressively worse. The other big factor is the value of the pound. As has been pointed out several times already, two thirds of the rise in its value had taken place before 1 May last year. The Government inherited both those deeply serious problems. It is no use the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) blaming the entire agricultural crisis on 12 months of Labour government, as he did this morning. The seeds of that crisis were part of the Labour Government's inheritance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Clwyd, South (Mr. Jones) pointed out, there has been significant progress on the beef ban. I know that our Agriculture Ministers have been involved in detailed negotiations and discussions with the European Commission at many levels over many weeks in an effort to get the ban lifted. So far there is only the certified herd scheme, and only for Northern Ireland, but it will cover the whole of Britain stage by stage. Moreover, there is now the date-based scheme for cattle born after 1 August 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in Prime Minister's questions last Wednesday and the previous week a note of cautious optimism from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister when he was asked about the beef ban. I put those points to my right hon. Friend the Agriculture Minister last Thursday and he, too, cautiously reflected my right hon. Friend's optimism. There is a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee on 20 May, when there is a good chance that we could make another important move towards our goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
The Government are responding extremely positively to the deep crisis in the beef industry. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley may shake his head, but his Government had made no progress 14 months after the beef ban. After 12 months of a Labour Government, we are moving forward in partnership with our European colleagues, and we hope that the darkest cloud over the agricultural industry will be lifted as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take an intervention from a representative of the Government who gave us BSE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another dark cloud is the strong pound. the value of the pound is the most serious problem that our Government faces, not just in respect of agriculture burt across all sectors. I am mindful of the 1979–81 recession, which was caused by an over-valued pound when the pound became a petro currency. that recession cost two million jobs in manufacturing industry and decimated large areas of industrial south Wales, Yorkshire and the midlands. The recession that occurred ten years later, between 1988 and 1992, happened because the pound was in the exchange rate mechanism at 2.95 deutschmarks, a value that was unsustainable. We could not sell our exports to the world at that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now back in the same position—there are 2.97 deutschmarks to the pound and we cannot compete at that level in any industry, not just in agriculture. The cause of the current problem is our high interest rates, uncertainty about the euro and the problems in the south-east Asian economies. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Members of the Cabinet are working solidly on the problems. We all earnestly hope that interest rates have peaked at 7.25 per cent. Because of the recession in manufacturing, the indications are that there will not be a rise when the Bank of England committee meets later this week and that the next move will be downwards. When interest rates start to fall, many other things will come into place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pound stood at DM3.10 and it is now down to DM2.97, but we cannot compete at that rate; we need something more like DM2.60 or DM2.70 to the pound. Effectively, we need a 10 per cent. devaluation. That will come in the next 12 months to two years. Interest rates will fall. That is the answer to the agricultural crisis. We need the beef ban lifted and interest rates to fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell all farmers—sometimes they do not want to hear this—that they should look long term. People have been in such acute crisis in the past three to six months that they have ceased to look three, five and ten years ahead. There is such a despond of hopelessness that they will not lift their eyes from the source to look five and 10 years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been persuaded over many years that our future is in Europe, as an integral part of the euro. When a new Labour Government takes us in that direction at the turn of the century, there will be one interest rate in Europe. It is now 3.3 per cent. If interest rates come down to 3.5 per cent., that will be wonderful for agriculture, borrowing and the value of the pound, property, land and our houses. Our mortgage rates will also be down to 3.5 or 4.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
There is light at the end of the tunnel for farmers who face severe cashflow problems. Over five years, we will get back to DM2.60 to the pound and interest rates of 4 or 3 per cent. The value of assets will be substantially increased, although I shall not go into multipliers. We will become a low-interest rate economy when we join the European currency.

I condemn the doom merchants. It is obviously part of the role of Opposition parties to look for negatives and to throw them at the Government. I was part of that process for 10 years. There needs, however, to be some perspective, and I am thinking of some of the headlines that we have seen on television and in the newspapers. One read, "Rural Wales in Crisis" and was followed by a whole series of articles. Another read, "Collapse in Rural Economy".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened on the hon. Member for Ceredigion this morning because he was very much in that thought frame. There is no collapse in the rural economy. I have a very rural seat—East Carmarthen and Dinefwr—and throughout my political involvement with Carmarthen town, it has always had the lowest unemployment in Wales among with Brecon, New Town and Welshpool. If one looks at the league tables, one sees that the travel-to-work areas around Carmarthen always have the lowest unemployment or thereabouts. About six weeks ago, I visited the Benefits Agency offices in Dinefwr, which forms the other half of my constituency. In the section that dealt with the jobseeker's allowance, I asked how many claimants there was. The number has halved over the past two years to 850, and I give the previous Government some credit for that. So there is no collapse. Of course, there will be time lags and delayed effects from the present crisis, but it does not help to indulge in hopeless exaggeration about a collapse in the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the report in 	<i>The Western Mail</i> of a week last Saturday about the 89 per cent. fall in farming income. The headline was absurd, and the test demonstrates some genius for economics. The press release in the 	<i>Farmers Guardian</i> of 1 May that produced the article stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The value of gross output from Welsh agriculture was over 10 per cent. lower than in 1996."</p></blockquote>
That is the value of farming. Output did not collapse by 89 per cent., but was 10 per cent. lower. During the bad year of 1996, the value of sheep production decreased by 21 per cent., the value of meat and meat products by 13 per cent., and that of beef by 1 per cent. Aggregating those figures to arrive at 89 per cent. is completely irresponsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept as did the Secretary of State, that farming incomes in 1997 were 40 per cent. lower than in 1996. The Labour Government cannot be blamed for that—the previous Government were responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers and members of other parties will not admit that 1992–95 were very good years in agriculture. The Committee should accept that farm incomes are down from a high base. It is not truthful to paint pictures of doom and gloom. One credibility problem in agriculture is that for many years and on many fronts it has been crying wolf. Now that the wolf is here, people in
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff and London, whose money is needed to pay agricultural compensation, do not believe that agriculture is in very difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention two other matters. The Government are working on an early retirement scheme, which will be ready by October. The scheme is, unfortunately, a necessary help, and offers up to £28,000 to people aged 55 to 65. An abundance of such people find it difficult to retire. The scheme has many sophisticated features, and I wish that the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and the Farmers Union of Wales were all positive about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The early retirement scheme is tied to a requirement for farm amalgamation. That is the objection to the scheme, not the fact that it is one for early retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, and it is why the previous Government did not opt into European arrangements for the scheme. However, it is regrettable that agriculture is in such difficult straits. One cannot have it both ways. Some element of restructuring has to be introduced, such as that which is enabled by voluntary early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that Opposition Members would consider agriculture in the long term. I believe that during three to five years, the beef ban will be lifted, interest rates and the value of the pound will fall, and land value will rise. At the next general election, the long-term salvation for agriculture will be for the pound to join the single currency. Only a Labour Government will do that. For those reasons, farmers throughout Wales will want the return of a Labour Government at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am delighted to have risen to the dizzy heights of the Welsh Grand Committee, having been a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. We are in Carmarthen, which, as everyone knows, is the town of Merlin and we need some magic to extract Welsh agriculture from its current problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital to get across to the Government the seriousness of the problem. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr is grossly complacent, which is perhaps why he was booed at lunch time, and underestimates the current problem. Current prices in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Oswestry, where most of the stock comes from Wales, are catastrophically lower. Spring lamb is 130p a kilo. A year ago it was 151p and two years ago it was 182p. Cull ewes are making £2. Hoggets are £25 or £30, the same price that they cost a year ago. Cattle are 83p a kilo. A year ago the figure was 102p and two years ago it was 110p. Milk prices have crashed, mainly because of the exchange rate, and the average price is now around 17p a litre. Eighteen months ago farmers here and near me in north-east Wales were receiving 26p a litre. That is a huge drop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State referred to grain as if there were rich grain barons in Wales. Barley is currently selling at around 70p a kilo. Barley on a 25-tonne articulated lorry is worth £1,000 less than two years ago. Every articulated lorry full of barley represents a loss of £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get across to Labour Members how bad the position is. I can give anecdotal evidence. An abattoir driver who picks up across north Wales said that he knows of 12 farms where the owners have sold the stock and walked away. Forget about selling the buildings and land, they just walked away. A machinery agent near me sold 50 machines last year—almost one a week—and this year he has sold one machine. I know a cattle dealer who tried to obtain £4,000 that had been owed to him for about six months by a big farmer who owns 300 cows, but he could not obtain a cheque. Things are really bad. The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr must not be complacent and glib and say that we can wait for things to come right in the never-never-land of the euro. Things are really bad now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from a farming family and I am the first to acknowledge that the problems have built up over the past 30 years. They are part of the political, bureaucratic nightmare that we have built around farming. It is ludicrous because farmers produce a product which every one of us needs every day. We all need to eat. Statistics show that world demand for food is rising in a straight line. World demand for grain is growing at 10 per cent. and, significantly, demand for dairy products is growing at about 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used often to visit Asia where there is no culture of eating dairy produce, but huge marketing campaigns by Europe, New Zealand and America have resulted in cheese and dairy products being acceptable to the vast, growing Chinese population. There are huge opportunities for the industry, yet we are discussing the biggest farming crisis in Wales since the 1930s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all the problems are of the Government's making, but some are. The Government exacerbated the exchange rate problem and made serious mistakes soon after taking office, when they created an independent Bank of England and introduced two Budgets that hit savings rather than encouraging them. That is the answer to the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) who, sadly, has left the Chamber. The problem with the exchange rate has been compounded by the appalling uncertainty of the euro and the weak leadership of the Prime Minister resulting in countries being allowed to qualify for the euro without meeting the Maastricht criteria. That has put extra
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
pressure on the pound and the dollar. The exchange rate, above all, is hammering fanners in Wales because they have one product that competes in a world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another area where the Government could help. They inherited a hideously complicated framework of regulations, partly from Europe and partly imposed by our own civil servants with greater zeal than necessary. The Government should stop creating more regulations. The beef on the bone order was a farce. I have twice as much chance of being hit by a meteorite as of developing BSE or CJD, if there is a connection, which has not been scientifically proven. The Government should stop adding to the regulations because it is driving people out of business. An abattoir in north Wales closed recently because its manager was fed up that he could not begin to kill in the morning without signing 27 forms. People will not put up with such regulation and it is not working. People in a big, modern, well-run abattoir in mid Wales told me that meat inspectors were the biggest culprits. They broke all the protocols on hygiene as they blundered from zone to zone in dirty clothes. Their mess-room was littered with dirty cups of coffee and half-eaten sandwiches—something that was specifically condemned by supermarket inspectors. The Government must be careful when they impose more regulation because it makes people concentrate on filling in forms and doing other paperwork instead of the important matters of safety and hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government came to office, they promised to accelerate the reform of the CAP. I strongly endorsed those pledges, which continued the previous Government's policy. However, the promises were half-hearted. Little was said this morning about agenda 2000. The current regime militates against efficient farmers. Dairy farmers are allowed to contribute only 85 per cent. of Great Britain's milk needs. That must be wrong. Farmers in the dairy sector have to carry a burden of 3 to 4p per litre. The cost is perhaps 16p and they are probably receiving 17p. However, farms in eastern Europe, as the right hon. Member for Llanelli said, are beginning to receive investment. Their production has increased and good quality milk from good plants can be brought from them at 17p a litre. We need the Government to listen, to accelerate the CAP reform and as the dairy sector moves nearer to world prices our farmers cannot bear the quota burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have direct control of some sectors. The sheep annual premium scheme and the hill livestock compensatory allowance were cut by 25 per cent. We have heard arguments today about agri-money compensation. The crisis was accelerated in the sheep industry by the appalling weather at the key lambing moment just before Easter. I hope that the Secretary of State has something in his back pocket because he needs to do something about the real and immediate crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that other members of the Committee want to speak but, as we are supposed to be looking a little beyond agriculture, I should like to mention fuel increases, another area of Government activity that penalises the rural economy. The 29p increase in diesel since the Government came to power does not make a single business or farm in Wales more competitive. It is no good talking about an integrated transport policy because it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
impossible to deliver public transport to every farm and village. The car, van, Land Rover and lorry will remain the staple form of transport for the Welsh rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vicious increases in fuel duty are an extra burden at a critical and delicate time. The Government, whose White Paper on integrated transport will be published soon, should look hard at rural areas and perhaps consider separate scales. I fully understand their policy on urban congestion, and I sympathise with their aims, but they are using a blunt instrument which has a vicious impact on a struggling rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackie Lawrence 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli, Pembrokeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the Committee which is almost situated in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) made two astounding statements. First, he said that Britain's quota covers only 80 per cent. of demand. Has he forgotten that at Maastricht Margaret Thatcher negotiated only 80 per cent. of quota for the United Kingdom when Ireland obtained 120 per cent. of its domestic requirement? Secondly, is not the rise in fuel costs a continuation by the Government of the 6 per cent. plus inflation fuel accelerator? The difference is that the Government have provided relief for public transport operators, which has helped rural transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for concentrating on the current agricultural crisis in that part of Wales. Farmers in Preseli Pembrokeshire are some of the hardest hit in Wales. Figures for 1995 relating to the former county of Dyfed, of which Pembrokeshire was a part, showed that it held 25 per cent. of the Welsh beef herd and 20 per cent. of the Welsh sheep herd. In 1995, the Welsh beef sector was worth £325 million, and one could assume that Dyfed's share was £80 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many farmers in my area, livestock is the main source of income. Just this week, I visited a typical Pembrokeshire farm owned by Vaughan Jenkins, just north of Haverfordwest. Mr. Jenkins runs the farm with the help of his wife and eldest daughter, and it is the sole source of family income. Like many others, he is worried about what the future holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my visit to that farm, I was greeted by other local farmers who wished to express their concerns. Not one was unaffected by the current crisis. Another farmer gave me figures showing a projected fall of £18,900 from his milk income and of £7,900 from livestock sales this year. One told me that he had been hoping to invest in a new milking parlour to replace the 27-year-old one that is currently in use. He has been advised to shelve those plans. Others told me of their sadness that their farms, which had been in the same family for generations, faced a bleak future because fewer and fewer sons were willing to enter farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At my regular constituency advice centres, I always set aside times to speak to farmers who are trying to cope with the current crisis. In several instances, I have met individual farmers who would qualify for family credit. This is the human side of the stark official figures, which show that farm incomes in Wales fell by 43.6 per cent. last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
However, last year is not the source of the problem. It is the culmination of decades of problems, including falling farm incomes, an increasingly complex supply chain to which farmers send their produce and what appears to be an uneven playing field across the supposed single market of the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems facing agriculture are involved and wide ranging, and there seems to be no single solution. One message that has been drummed home to me by farmers in my constituency is the fact that decisions taken now will not impact fully on the industry for at least two years. That makes it more important to ensure that the action that is taken now is right and that it is taken after full analysis of the complex range of issues that are involved. That will benefit our farmers and our rural communities as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very fabric of our countryside and communities has been moulded by the unique nature of Welsh farming. My constituency is a good example. It is split across the middle by the Landsker line, with Welsh-speaking communities to the north and English-speaking communities to the south. The northern communities are based on Welsh inheritance patterns, by which, on the death of the father, land is subdivided among all the sons. In the south the communities are marked by the English inheritance patterns, by which, on the death of the father, the land passes to the eldest son. I shall not make a comment on gender. That has resulted in very different settlement patterns in the two halves of my constituency. The impact of land management has shaped our countryside. That is visible in the nature of our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern of such land management since the war has meant gradual rural depopulation for Wales. We have seen more markedly elsewhere in the United Kingdom farming practices by which farms have amalgamated and in some instances have turned England's green and pleasant land into something more reminiscent of the prairies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want that in Wales because we have the extra dimension of language and culture, which are so dependent on those who farm the land and who keep the countryside a living countryside. It must not become simply a place of recreation or retirement for those who spend their economically active years in urban surroundings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With one in five jobs in rural Wales dependent on agriculture, there is massive concern at the effect of the continued crisis on related industries, from rural shops to agricultural machinery suppliers and feed merchants. That is why the current crisis affects not just farming, but Wales as a whole. That is why it is vital that we continue to support our farmers in every way possible until the actions taken now have time to work to their benefit in the future. In the past, farmers managed to struggle through hard times that affected one or other sector of their industry by relying on another not so badly affected. The problem now is that they are all badly affected, some worse than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Tory Government's infamous announcement on 20 March 1996 in relation to beef and BSE was the real onset of the current serious difficulties.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
The beef export ban must be lifted. It is gratifying that the Government have taken immediate action towards that since 1 May last year. We hope that the opening up of markets to Northern Ireland producers is the start of the end of that ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, with the reduced demand for red meat throughout Europe and the entire EU faced with cuts in production, there is concern among Welsh farmers that the United Kingdom is a scapegoat, taking the brunt of the EU reduction in production. That fear, whether justified or not, is a direct result of the previous Government's ineptitude, and the blame for that can be laid firmly at the feet of a succession of Tory Ministers of Agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest news of a currency revaluation will inevitably have an impact on farmers. The FUW has made clear its disappointment that past Governments failed to pursue in full the resources available to compensate for the adverse consequences of green currency revaluation. Although the Government took up the money available from Europe for the livestock sector just before Christmas, there is growing concern at the continued strength of the pound. On behalf of Welsh farmers in my constituency and elsewhere, I urge Ministers to press again for maximum help from that quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also concerns among farmers that, in implementing the EU early retirement scheme, the word "amalgamate" should be removed from the UK requirements. Instead of using the scheme to enlarge holdings, we should use it positively to reduce the age profile of our farmers and keep our communities alive. The Irish Government proposed that the EU should delete the requirement to amalgamate. I urge Ministers to recognise the importance of pursuing this course of action for Wales because of its unique position in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue on which farmers in my constituency are urging the Government to act is an amendment to the existing domestic regulations on specified risk materials. The amendment enables whole ewe carcasses to be exported from Wales to France to approved cutting plants, where the spinal cord can be removed under official French control. That could go some way towards relieving the pressure on the lamb section of the livestock sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other pressures on Welsh farming which, while not the direct responsibility of the Government, could be affected by any action that they take. Farmers are standing by helpless and powerless in the face of what they see as the dominance of the major retailers in the supply chain for their products. While beef prices in livestock marts have plummeted from £1.40 a kilo last year to roughly 80p a kilo this year, consumers are still paying roughly the same at major supermarkets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey that I undertook in Haverfordwest showed fillet steak retailing at £15.83 a kilo and Welsh lamb at £10.29 a kilo, at the same time as producers were getting 82p a kilo for their beef animals. Although the Office of Fair Trading looked into supermarket trading only last September, it seems that its considerations were laterally based only, in respect of competitor supermarkets. From what farmers are telling me, it seems that there is a good case for the Government to insist that the OFT looks at
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
the vertical restraints within the supply chain. With supermarkets holding around 70 per cent. of the food retail market, major questions need to be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As politicians, we know that the Government are committed to a vibrant and living countryside. They are already taking action on rural transport initiatives, help for rural schools, tax reductions for small businesses—which in rural areas are the main employers—rate relief for rural shops and post offices and long-term changes to the CAP that will directly support farmers and deliver sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential that we continue to respond to the growing pressures on our farmers in a changing world, if we are to see them through these difficult times. I am confident that the three Welsh Office Ministers—who all represent Welsh constituencies—recognise that and will do everything possible to provide that support. If not, I assure them that I will pester them. However, I am sure that they will do that for our rural communities in particular, and for Wales as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Ruane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Clwyd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones for giving me an opportunity to participate in the debate on the rural economy. Many hon. Members have spoken about the problems that the rural economy is now experiencing. Those problems are in addition to two other devastating economic blows to Wales over the past two decades. The first affected your constituency, Mr. Jones, of Alyn and Deeside, and many of the south Wales valleys—the decline of the traditional Welsh industries of coal and steel. In the 1930s, the coal industry alone employed 270,000 workers in Wales; now, there are fewer than 1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area of decline that is often neglected is the decline that has affected the seaside towns that dot our beautiful coast line. Seaside towns such as Rhyl and Prestatyn, which constitute 66 per cent. of my constituency, have suffered terribly over the past 20 years, which is partly the fault of the previous Government and partly the result of changing consumer demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has had success stories, especially in the north-east and the south-east, where tens of thousands of jobs have been created or safeguarded by inward investment. In other areas, including Denbighshire and Conwy, the economic miracle has not materialised. The fragile economies of those two counties, based on agriculture and tourism, could not absorb the economic changes and bring into those areas the jobs that we desperately need. The result is some terrible statistics for the central part of north Wales. Conwy, for example, has the lowest GDP in Wales, the lowest pay levels in the UK and the lowest record of inward investment in the European Union, with no jobs created through inward investment in the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Denbighshire presses hot on the heels of Conwy. Since January this year, the following job losses have been announced: 800 at Kwik Save; 25 at Snow King in Denbigh; 25 at a printers in Denbigh; 185 at Hotpoint in Bodelwyddan; 50 at Denbighshire county council; 50 at Celtec in St. Asaph; 20 at a tweed mill weavers in St. Asaph; 20 at the Halifax building society in Rhyl;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
600 at the north Wales hospital; 200 at the Kwik Save transport section in Prestatyn; and 300 at the Point of Ayr pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a massive jobs haemorrhage in my constituency and in Denbigh-Conwy as a whole. The pace of job losses is increasing; it is now slowing down. Before January, there had been about 1,100 job losses in the previous three years; since then, there have been 1,400 in three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An economic black hole is emerging in the central part of north Wales. We are failing to attract jobs and investment to replace the jobs that are haemorrhaging from our local economies. One of the key reasons for the lack of investment for a large part of north Wales is that Conservative Members who represented Denbighshire and Conwy supported the previous Conservative Government's policy of taking away European grants from north Wales. That occurred to such an extent that a senior British civil servant in Brussels said that north Wales had the worst grants deal in Europe, according to the most recent review, conducted by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked a previous representative of my constituency—in fact, of 55 per cent. of my current constituency—Mr. Rod Richards, at a Rhyl town council meeting, "Why did you vote for that? Why did you support taking away investment and grants from your own constituency, from your own people, who you are there to represent?" He said proudly to the council members, "It is a matter of pride. It means that our area is standing on its own two feet." I can tell Mr. Richards that as a result of his policies, my constituency is not standing on its own two feet economically; it is on its knees. It is on its knees as a result of the previous Government's policies. If no help is given to the area, it will be economically crippled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to contrast the attitude of the current Welsh Office and its Ministers to that of the previous Government. When I, my hon. Friends the Members for Conwy (Mrs. Williams) and for Clwyd, West and the hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Clwyd, South took Denbighshire and Conwy's case to the Welsh Office, we were listened to positively. We presented our case, they accepted it, and we were included in the Welsh objective 1 bid, which is now being presented to Europe. I thank the Ministers for doing that, which is in complete contrast to the attitude shown by the Welsh Office during the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Once that case is ready, I am sure that Ministers will do their best to ensure that Wales is given objective 1 status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon Friend's pleasure at the positive response by Welsh Office Ministers to the case put by Conwy and Denbighshire. Does he agree that although the Welsh Office has a considerable amount of work to do in relation to the transition to a National Assembly for Wales and the resolution of the difficult logistical issues involved, it is essential that serious, focused attention should be given to the question of objective 1 status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ruane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West and I approached my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State seven days ago, to reiterate the case for Denbighshire, Conwy and the whole of Wales to be placed at the highest level. Objective 1 status will enable 15 of the most economically damaged counties in Wales to tap into £2 billion of aid between 2000 and 2006. That will provide £350 million each year to be shared between 15 counties, to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to take them into the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Objective 1 is the highest grant category in Europe. It helped turn the Irish economy from a backward rural economy to a modern, rural, Celtic tiger economy, with growth rates of 10 per cent. a year, which has had massive beneficial effects on both the rural and urban economies in Ireland. I travelled across to Ireland during the Recess to visit my relatives in Tralee and Galway, and evidence of the economic turnaround was everywhere. It was in every city, village and hamlet across Ireland. There were improvements to the infrastructure, to roads, railways and harbours, each of which bore the EU flag—proclaiming 85 per cent. funding here, 50 per cent. funding there. It was evident in the five and six-bedroom houses popping up in every community in Ireland. It was evident in the bustling shops and the packed pubs with their ringing tills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic revival has led to a cultural revival in Ireland. I attended the pan-Celtic festival in Tralee, at which six Celtic nations were present. In fact, my aunty Kay is president of the pan-Celtic festival committee in Ireland. I saw a culturally and economically confident nation. We could have the same benefits within 18 months—by January 2000—if we present our case properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not count our chickens before they hatch. The fight for objective 1 status will be difficult because every poor area in Europe will be fighting for the limited funds, but we can put a cogent case together. I believe that the Welsh Office now and the Welsh Assembly next year, in co-operation with county councils, should draw up contingency plans for projects across the objective 1 area to ensure that every pound is spent wisely. We need a proper infrastructure to take us into the next century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a strong case for acceptance. I know that my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Welsh Office ministerial team and, indeed, in the Cabinet, are promoting the case for Wales in Europe. I am pleased that the Prime Minister is fully backing the Welsh objective 1 bid in Europe. That may prove critical in the months ahead. Every Welsh Member of Parliament in this Room today should keep up the pressure at all levels to ensure that we get the much needed objective 1 status by the year 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Caton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the severity of the crisis in Welsh agriculture, we are in danger of focusing on fanning to the exclusion of other major problems facing our rural communities. Before I concentrate on one of those other problems, I want to stress that a thriving farming sector is integral to the maintenance and protection of as sustainable rural economy and society. That is especially true in Wales where a much higher percentage of jobs is directly or indirectly tied to agriculture. For that reason I too am worried about the consequences of introducing an early retirement scheme if it requires the amalgamation of farm holdings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise the significance of hill livestock compensatory allowances in helping to sustain rural economies in those areas where farmers find it more difficult to achieve an adequate return, as is the case in much of Wales. We must get on with rewarding farmers for a stewardship role in the countryside. My constituency of Gower was a pilot area for the Tir Cymen scheme, and I was impressed by the farms that I visited which were involved in it. I saw an important dimension of the future. The scheme, which certainly seems to work, needs to be implemented across Wales. That must happen soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I said, I do not want to concentrate on agriculture but on the further education sector in rural Wales and the further education sector serving rural Wales, because some of our urban-based FE colleges deliver education to rural areas. The further education sector in Wales has done wonders in recent years. It increased the number of students in further education by 52 per cent. between 1993 and 1996. That growth, which has continued, is especially welcome because the strongest growth was in the number of women and those people over 21 participating in the FE sector. More of our people look to further education than to any other sector to achieve the qualifications that they need. Yet over that period of astonishing growth, further education has been perceived and treated as a Cinderella service in the education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence submitted to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee before the general election highlighted people's dismay about the lack of recognition of what is being achieved and the frustration felt at the failure properly to restore the sector. It was interesting to see—this is as true now as it was then—that most colleges accepted in general the methodology for funding allocation. Their complaint was not so much the way in which the cake was being cut, but its size in relation to the increasing number of mouths it was supposed to feed. However, four questions were raised about the methodology which I believe are relevant to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it was recognised that the formula was harder on small colleges where management costs were proportionately higher. That is especially true in an era of efficiency savings. Secondly, it was argued that additional
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
finance built into the formula for rurality tried to compensate for the problems faced by colleagues serving countryside communities. It was recognised that the formula provided inadequate compensation and failed to provide anything for colleges serving rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it recommended that the Welsh medium factor should be further enhanced more accurately to reflect the costs of providing bilingual options—that is particularly relevant to rural areas. Fourthly, it called for better support for non-schedule 2 category courses—that is courses that do not lead to a qualification—which often provide the pathway to bring adults back into formal eduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By far the most important point raised by the Committee related to the size of the overall cake. It called for reconsideration of projected levels of recurrent funding for the further education sector because of its concern about year-on-year requirements for efficiency savings—cuts to you and I—at the same time as student numbers continued to increase. It also emphasised that planned reductions in capital funding could lead to the smaller colleges, especially in rural areas, entering a spiral of decline. The report hit some important nails on the head. Although we would have been living in a land of fairy tales to have expected the previous Government to respond positively the further education sector has not yet moved out of Cinderella mode, even under the new Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's settlement for the further education sector makes depressing reading. As the Further Education Funding Council for Wales says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Compared to 1997–98 the sector is being required to teach 4,500 more students for £2 million less funding."</p></blockquote>
The same report says that colleges are being asked to find efficiency gains of 10.7 per cent. At Gorseinon college in my constituency—I declare an interest as president of the college—that will mean a cut of £400,000. Staff, students and parents are angry and bewildered. They say to me, "We elected you on a manifesto promise that education was your first, second and third priority. Why is a Labour Government doing this to us?" Frankly, "sorry" seems an inadequate response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will that efficiency gain mean at Gorseinon college, which serves an urban and a rural population, but get no rurality funding? It will have to make those savings by the near destruction of community education provision, especially in the villages of Gower. A class of fewer than 16 loses money—it does not even pay for the lecturer—but the college has been providing classes in villages such as Rhosilli, Scurlage, Llangennech and elsewhere in Gower, where they know that they will never reach the magic figure of 16. In Pontarddulais, an old mining village but certainly a rural village, the college set up an excellent education centre in the high street, which provided a base for all sorts of classes, but none of them will reach the figure of 16 pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to maintain its core work with 16 to 19-year-olds, Gorseinon college simply cannot offer that sort of provision in the coming year. Lifelong learning opportunities are being cut back in the second year of a

Labour Government. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), the Under-Secretary of State, has been tied by the Government's commitment on public spending and that he looks forward to announcing better news once the comprehensive spending review is completed. He recently visited Gorseinon college and recognised the outstanding quality of the education it provides. But while we wait for him to find a glass slipper to fit Cinderella next year, will he also consider what can be done this year in the light of the Select Committee's recommendations? It expressed concern about rurality, smaller colleges and non-schedule 2 courses? Will he consider removing the 5 per cent. cap on growth so that colleges can grow out of the problem, as they have had to do in previous years? Will he consider special provision for community education? Will he do whatever is necessary and try to find more money for this vital part of our education system. We have invested in nursery education and found extra money for primary and secondary schools. We have addressed higher education—not, perhaps, as many of us would have liked, but we have addressed the matter. Why has further education been left in the cold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be able to participate in this debate. I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton), who made a forceful case, and other hon. Members who have been newly elected to the House. My hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) and for Preseli Pembrokeshire made forceful cases on behalf of their constituents at this time of crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the optimism of my hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr about the future of farming in Wales. I base my pessimism on the compelling and disturbing evidence from the Institute of Welsh Affairs on the future prospects of agriculture in Wales. My hon. Friend said that the problems will be resolved when we go into the European monetary system, but that is dependent on a referendum of the British people. At the moment, it is unlikely that the British people would support entry to the European monetary system. The people of Monmouthshire and perhaps Carmarthenshire are unlikely to vote for that at the moment, but I cannot predict what they may do in the future. I would not want to risk too much on an optimistic scenario based on the presumption that we shall go into the European monetary system and the euro.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate my comments on agriculture. We have seen in recent weeks and months a number of peaceful demonstrations, including those in Abergavenny and Monmouth, on behalf of Welsh farming interests. Agriculture is the dominant industry in Monmouthshire and my job is to represent the concerns of the farming community in Monmouthshire. We have today seen a march of farmers in Carmarthen. We have previously seen a lobby of farmers from Wales to Westminster and on St. David's day the countryside rally in London was attended by more than 20,000 people from Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attended the countryside rally, with criticism from some people in my party in Monmouthshire. I attended at the invitation of the Farming Union of Wales because
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
the dominant issue affecting the countryside today is the collapse in farm incomes, not the right of people to hunt animals as sport. I voted in support of the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) in accordance with the overwhelming views of constituents who wrote to me. My concern at the countryside rally was that the voice of farmers, especially the farmers of Wales, should not be drowned by the sound of hunting horns and the fund-raising activities of the Conservative party. I hope that the real grievances of the farming community are not sidelined by the pro-hunting lobby. At the mass meeting of farmers that I have attended in Monmouthshire and Westminster the issue of hunting with dogs has not been raised once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to members of the farming unions and the Country Landowners Association, who were here this morning. I regret that I was not here at the beginning of our sitting due to the disruption on the railway. It took two and a half hours to travel from Neath this morning. If my right hon. Friend the deputy Prime Minister wants to encourage people off the road, he should do a little more to ensure that we have a reliable public transport system and that a journey of 30 miles does not take two and a half hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to those involved in preparing the detailed briefing material that we have received, including that from the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs. According to Professor Peter Midmore, from 1995–96 to 1996-97 small hill and dairy upland farm incomes fell by 52 per cent. and large hill cattle and sheep farm incomes fell by 33 per cent. He argued that the continued depression in the demand for beef, combined with the effect of an appreciating pound and the reduced compensation for cattle under the over-thirty-month scheme suggests that in 1998 farm incomes will fall even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Select Committee has been looking at the issue, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South raised it earlier. I do not want to predict the outcome of the Committee's report but the picture that has emerged so far is both depressing and perplexing. Particularly perplexing is the creative accounting, which seems to deny that there has been any profiteering by certain supermarkets, although the evidence shows that the spread of prices and retail prices is widening. The Select Committee has revealed a number of worrying facts, including claims that the largest food retailer in Britain has made no profit on meat for five years; the invisibility of imported beef in the retail sector, despite the evidence that in 1997 the UK sucked in an additional 41 per cent. of beef supplies from other EU member states; the dependence of frozen food manufacturers on sourcing lamb from New Zealand, because Wales, they say, cannot supply the quantity or the quality that the industry requires and lacks the refrigeration facilities that it requires; the increasing demands of supermarkets for farm-assured production and the standardisation of produce to meet the apparent consumer demand; the marketing of meat to people in Wales as Welsh meat, while in England it is often marketed as British, whereas Scotch beef remains Scotch beef, whether it is sold in Scotland, England or Wales; and the depressing prognosis for the traditional livestock marts of Wales.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
There have been some positive announcements. I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, who has had the courage to face his critics in the industry in the past 12 months and has not been afraid to face the farmers in their present anger. I think that the farmers respect that. He deserves credit for always being willing to face those in this industry who are being severely hit. The £12 million package for Welsh farmers was announced in December. It was more than some of us feared, but not as much as we had hoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent Government decision to cover the £70 million costs of the traceability scheme and the beef hygiene service owes much to the farmers lobbying and negotiating with Ministers and to the lobbying undertaken by hon. Members of all political parties. The establishment of the food hygiene service has been a welcome announcement, as well as the inquiry into the handling of the BSE fiasco, which must expose the culpability of politicians and officials. The next campaign must be to end the beef export ban. the announcement on the Northern Ireland certified herd scheme will, we hope, be a prelude to the lifting of the scheme for the rest of the United Kingdom. I believe that that will depend on the Prime Minister's skills in persuading European heads of state to take the European perspective and not to submit to the protectionist tendencies of countries like Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for short-term measures. I am not yet convinced by the Government's argument that we cannot get more through the agri-money compensation scheme and I hope that the Government will make further representations in the next round of discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also welcome the Welsh Office inquiry into HLCAs by Professor Midmore. Those payments are essential measures to respond to the disadvantaged socio-economic conditions in Wales, where 80 per cent. is designated as less favoured. However, farmers have been contacting me recently, about late payments from the Welsh Office. We must sort the matter out. I know of one farmer in my constituency who, because of the late payment, is now in jeopardy to the landlord from whom he rents his barn. He needs the money from the Welsh Office to pay his quarterly rent bills. To the disappointment of the Welsh Office and us in Wales, the system in England has been working more efficiently and effectively than in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a long-term strategy, a national strategy for agriculture. Governments of both political persuasions have lacked such a strategy. The previous Conservative Government were ideologically opposed to state intervention or long-term planning; they supported the monopoly power of the supermarkets and were alienated in the European Union. They also contributed to the BSE crisis, as the current inquiry will prove. Their obsession with deregulation has been an important contributory factor to the BSE crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government have been keen to publish a White Paper on a range of policy areas—health, education and welfare—as well as a White Paper on drugs within six months of appointing a drugs tsar. We have not yet been promised a White Paper on agriculture for Britain as
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
a whole, or for Wales in particular, where the need is greater because of our greater dependence on livestock. That approach must change. Just as we have a strategic defence review, we should also have a strategic agricultural review, which would comprehensively examine the whole food chain. We should have a strategy for diversification and an adequate early retirement scheme. I am sure that Ministers will listen to representations that were made about the amalgamation problem. It is important to develop a long-term strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twelve months ago, the Government were elected with a massive majority. I hope that Committee members who were returned to the House of Commons in that election will make a better case for agriculture than some of the people whom we displaced. I hope and believe that many aspects of British life have improved under a Labour Government, but I fear that they have not got better for our fanning community. I sincerely hope that there will be improvements in due course, although, in the short term, we may need further remedial measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our strategy in other parts of the economy is better than our approach in this context. With respect, we have not discussed the stakeholder approach in relation to agriculture in the way that we did in relation to manufacturing or small industry, and we have not discussed social exclusion in relation to the agricultural community in the way that we did in relation to other minority or disadvantaged groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farming community exists in the context of gross social and economic inequality. The problems that it faces include maladministration of the CAP, inequalities in land holdings and values, and the plight of individual farmers against the buying power of big supermarkets. Those farmers rear livestock in all conditions, climates and uncertainties, but they have to go to market and ask, "what will you give me for my product?" there seems to be a gross inequality in the distribution of power in favour of retailing giants and against basic producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farming community provides an essential social service for the people of Britain. It provides food to eat and it maintains the countryside that we all cherish. For that role it receives scant reward. In recent years, it has increasingly met that role with barely sufficient income to service burdensome debt. I doubt whether many suppliers from the consumer components industry would tolerate the variable economic conditions and unfair structure that the farming community considers normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why will we no introduce the concept of fair remuneration for people in the agricultural sector? Agricultural workers will be subject to the minimum wage next year, but evidence suggests that many of those receiving that wage will be employed by people on incomes that are lower than the minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers devote an entire lifetime to producing food for our people. They deserve a secure future, which they can attain only if the industry has a strong, clear, long-term strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As a north Walian I happily lay claim to some of the most colourful figures in Welsh history, including William Williams Pantycelyn, the great hymnist and spiritualist, Vicer Pritchard, Hywel Dda and Jim Griffiths, who was the first Secretary of State for Wales. I could also include Gwenallt, the important Welsh-language poet, who had strong family links with rural Carmarthenshire, although he was brought up in the industrial area of the lower Swansea valley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the themes of Gwenallt's work is the need to establish unity between rural and industrial Wales. In his famous poem, "Sir Forganwg a Sir Gaefyrddin", he talked of the need for an inclusive approach to the challenges that Wales faces. He did so long before the current generation of Welsh politicians began to think in such terms. He writes in that poem:
	<br><blockquote><p>"cydfydd fferm a ffwrnais ar Ei ystad.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Dyneiddiaeth y pwll glo, duwioldeb y wlad</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Tawe a Thywi, Canaan a Chymru, daear a nef".</p></blockquote>
The need for a united approach to the problems that our rural areas face is a theme that I should like to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the rural economy in Wales is under severe pressure. The statistics speak for themselves. The depression has been part of a long-standing problem, but has recently developed into a crisis. I agree with many hon. Members who have emphasised the crisis in rural Wales resulting from factors that have already been widely canvassed: the ban on beef exports following the BSE crisis and the strength of the pound, which has had the pernicious effect of hindering exports and encouraging imports as well as undercutting the value to farmers of subsidies, which are such an important part of farm incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent the fourth most rural constituency in Wales. I am only too aware of the grave anxieties of farmers in my constituency; I have met many over the past year at meetings the length and breadth of my constituency, at Ruthin, Abergele, Pentrefoelas, Cerrigydrudion, Llansannan and Llanefydd. There is genuine despair, as was exemplified in a letter that I received recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mommouth (Mr. Edwards) on his substantial and original speech. I agree with much of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with most other areas of Wales, in my constituency the majority of farmers are hill farmers, farming less favoured areas. Rearing sheep and cattle is the predominant activity. Most farms are small, family-owned holdings, which reflects the Welsh pattern, whereby about 70 per cent. of all farms are officially classified as small or very small in European terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, 70 per cent. of farms are family holdings. Only a very small percentage of land is sold annually, which indicates that the typical pattern is for farms to be inherited on a family basis. Such factors, along with heavy financial burdens, make it difficult for young people to start up farming. The agricultural population is aging, which is also a cause for serious concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small family farms are an integral part of the rural economy. Indeed, they constitute the backbone of rural Wales. They are also an essential part of the social and economic fabric of many communities in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
The crisis threatens the life of the rural economy. Significantly, as has been revealed by today's debate, it also threatens our cultural inheritance and heritage as a nation, because in such communities, the Welsh language is still strong. In my constituency in the north-east, there is a strong and rich cultural inheritance. The Urdd movement is especially strong in the counties of Denbighshire and Flintshire. I pay tribute to the hard work done to make the Urdd the most popular and well supported youth movement in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday I held a surgery in the village of Llangernyw—an active and proudly Welsh community—where I met Councillor John Hughes, who is now well known throughout the whole of Wales, along with members of the trust established to remember that great Welshman Sir Henry Jones. Sir Henry's home, "Y Cwm", still stands in the village and its official opening as a museum will take place shortly. Sir Henry Jones was the main force behind the 1889 Welsh joint education legislation and one of the originators of the idea of decentralising government in Wales, for which last year's referendum vote in favour of a Welsh assembly was an important milestone. This county played a significant and substantial part in that result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the cultural context, I agree with the view of many people that not only the rural economy but our culture and language are under the threat. It is vital that we work together as a nation to seek solutions to that problem. I know that time is short, Mr. Jones. This is not a party political issue and it is not helpful to blame the present Government for the problems inherited from the previous Government. It is also not helpful to accuse the Government of being anti-countryside. Although the Opposition might find it advantageous to promulgate such views, I urge them not to do so for the benefit of the whole of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Town and country have to speak with one voice. Wales needs a strong rural economy, which is part of our identity. We must keep Wales farming, maintain strong communities and encourage our farmers to defend our environment and landscape, which are such important assets for the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can be done in the face of this crisis? First, we must listen. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on always keeping the door open. He has a good reputation in Wales as someone who is willing to listen. We also need to respond. I accept that the Government have responded to some extent and that many of their measures have been beneficial and constructive. The introduction of various packages—£85 million before Christmas, and £70 million more recently—have certainly helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look again at the compensation fund available in Europe, to compensate farmers for the effects of the strong pound. We must monitor that situation, and if it worsens we must bring pressure to bear on the Cabinet. I understand why the Government are unwilling to make use of the fund and, to some extent, they have used the fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
I would like to make three vital points in closing which relate to the revival of the Welsh rural economy. First, the agri-environment scheme, to which reference has already been made, must be adequately funded. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of that. It is of central importance if the idea of making farmers guardians of the landscape and environment is to be more than empty rhetoric. Secondly, the Government must have a co-ordinated approach to the promotion of small businesses. I hope that the National Assembly for Wales will create a more entrepreneurial society in Wales by promoting self-confidence and helping small businesses. That is especially vital for rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and final point concerns the Welsh Office. It must give the highest possible priority to ensuring that Wales receives the best possible deal from the review of the CAP. I want to re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that Wales benefits—if there are to be benefits—from the objective 1 fund. Welsh Office Ministers must focus on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the most interesting issues in the debate is that everyone who has spoken has a direct line to the rural economy of Wales. Because of that, this has been a powerful debate, which has crossed many boundaries and brought a great deal of information to our attention. I regret the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire, whom I saw yesterday, but I am happy to report that he is getting considerably better. I know that he wanted to contribute to the debate. He sends his best wishes, which, judging by the number of cards in his hospital, many hon. Members have expressed to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Ceredigion on his wide-ranging introduction to the debate and on focusing on the impact of the crisis in agriculture on the rural economy in Wales. He rightly stressed how it is affecting all parts of the rural economy and said that one aspect is related to another. How is it, however, that the Labour party, which was the architect of the Agriculture Act 1947—one of the most epoch-making and substantial pieces of legislation this century, which prevented agriculture from going into decline after the second world war—finds itself dealing with a huge agricultural slump? We have defined the slump's cause as the impact of the high pound sterling value on livestock prices; as green currencies, which have distorted the situation; as the lack of adequate agri-money compensation, which many other countries in the European Community have been able to receive; as the disastrous impact of BSE, which was largely the responsibility of the previous Government, who were in office for 18 years; and as additional bureaucracy and charges, which were inflicted on the industry in the past 18 months to two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of those factors on farm incomes has led to a 43 per cent. fall in aggregate income, which affects the ability of farming families to survive economically, whether on dairy farms, cattle and sheep farms in less favoured areas, or cattle and sheep farms in lowland areas—the three most important aspects of Welsh
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
livestock farming. Incomes in those sectors have fallen by up to 40 per cent. and, in some cases, by up to 50 per cent. in real terms over the past 12 months. The situation is very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to labour the point because we covered it earlier, but in April 1995, beef was selling for 120p a kilo; in April 1998, it was selling for 83.97p a kilo. That is a tragedy. The price for sheep has dropped to 105p a kilo from 198p a kilo two years ago. The price of milk has dropped by at least 7p a litre and may soon be down by 9p a litre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those price falls are disastrous. No business can expect to survive a drop of one third in its gross income. That situation cannot be tolerated for much longer. The Secretary of State said that taxpayers' and his constituents' money would not be available to fund any more than the £85 million or so that has been granted—indeed, the figure for Wales is only £12.2 million—because it would then be necessary to pay out in order to obtain additional money from the European Union. I must tell the Secretary of State that his constituents have already paid for the compensation of farmers in other European Union countries. That is a sad state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By comparison, Welsh farmers have received very little of his constituents' money to support them, and the Government have gained £190 million from the sheep annual premiums for agri-money, and £205 million from the OTMS. We know that it is possible to draw £412 million from Europe for compensation, and the Government have paid out £400 million of the farmers' own money. It is a fair bargain to use the farmers' own money to get the other £412 million for compensation. There is increasing evidence that the Chancellor is building up a large war chest of money, some of which should be used to save our family farms. The Chancellor should have been here today to hear members of his party explain in graphic detail what has been happening to agriculture in Wales.

The new agri-environmental scheme is an excellent idea, based on the lead of Tir Cymen, but many of us feel that the butter will be spread so thinly that it will not amount to a great deal, and many farmers will receive no assistance at all. It will certainly be no good unless the same sum of money that makes up headage payments is paid out under the agri-environmental scheme. I agree that the Welsh food strategy needs improvement and more business needs to be attracted into rural areas. I especially welcome the fact that we have defined the four regions of Wales, as well as the Secretary of State's emphasis on the importance of rural development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many contributions to the debate. I fear that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley shed crocodile tears in his lament over what had happened in the past 18 years, but now realised what devastation had been caused. This Government are on trial, but I think that the hon. Gentleman went so far as to reprimand the Secretary of State before he has had a chance to tackle the problems that we are discussing.

The right hon. Member for Llanelli gave an interesting commentary on Britain's contribution of £3.5 billion to the EU, and on Tesco and the prices of meat. It is extraordinary that supermarkets contribute to political
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
parties. Sainsbury contributed to the Labour party's election campaign and has contributed to my party in the past, and I know that Tesco contributes to the Conservative party. We must be careful not to be slaves to such paymasters, but to consider the matter accurately and objectively, otherwise we shall be hopelessly compromised. Unfortunately, there is no level playing field in agricultural support. Even the United States, although it will never admit it, supports agriculture in many commodities by up to 40 per cent. That is not a level playing field, so we must be very careful. As a certain member of the House of Commons said a long time ago, people are not always elected, particularly where the WTO is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, the hon. Member for Clwyd, South, referred to many of the aspects that the Committee is considering at the moment, particularly in relation to the food chain and supermarkets. I agree that our findings do not add up and I back him all the way. The Select Committees's report should be referred to the Office of Fair Trading, because a great deal is going on. Some might say that something is rotten in the state of Denmark—and it is not only bacon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon concentrated on the importance of getting objective 1 status for Wales. I want to make a more parochial point. I am anxious that the county of Powys should have support as well. It certainly deserves objective 2 status at least, because its GDP percentage is now below 75 per cent. Had the formula not been mucked up by the previous Government, we might be talking about objective 1 status for Powys as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr did not treat the crisis as seriously as he should have, although he said many sensible things about the pound, particularly about the consequence of black Wednesday and similar matters with a bearing on what has taken place in the agriculture industry recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire mentioned the crisis in the market place concerning the price of livestock, of which he has direct experience in the Oswestry area. I agree that the slump in prices has been catastrophic, as has the impact of increased fuel prices. I voted with the Conservative party on the issue of fuel prices the other day, because it has had a penal effect on rural dwellers who have no other means of transport but a clapped-out car to get to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire made an extremely brave speech, particularly in relation to not wanting farms to be amalgamated on retirement. She is right in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd appears to have suffered a catastrophic series of events relating to unemployment in his constituency. I wish him well and I urge Welsh Office Ministers to assist him with his unemployment problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gower referred to problems in the further education sector. Clearly, those are matters of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
The hon. Member for Monmouth spoke with great sincerity. I have talked to him on platforms and on marches and demonstrations. He did not pull his punches, but stated precisely the position of his farming constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the remarks of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West about the historic context in which rural Wales finds itself were particularly interesting. He underlined the crisis as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summing up, I need to make a number of points rapidly. First, the farming community requires justice, otherwise, there will be an exodus from rural Wales within the next year. Farming in rural Wales is bankrupt at DM3 to the pound. Something must be done about that urgently. Not only must the beef ban be lifted, but the date-based scheme, which I understand is about to come on stream, cannot come soon enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, women in agriculture in my constituency sent 200 pairs of children's wellington boots to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—they still await an answer—because they say that their children will never get the opportunity to farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to get our teeth into some solutions: we must join the euro now, to get a lower pound; we must get access to the green pound compensation scheme; HLCAs must be treated as sacrosanct; we need a Welsh Minister of agriculture; youth must be given a chance to start farming; and we need to control the supermarkets and break their monopoly. For example, in Wales Safeway sells only 9 per cent. of Welsh meat and 34 per cent. of Scottish meat—there is something wrong there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be at the Institute of Grassland and Environment Research conference that is going on today in Aberystwyth. It is discussing new farming systems, reliance on grassland and grass production and new systems of lower cost production for Welsh farmers. We must be innovative if we are to solve some of our problems. That means that we must act in co-operation and we must make the powerhouse pro-active in producing meat-packing plants. We should also encourage marketing initiatives and produce a strategy, together with the farming unions, that will help Welsh farming to survive and which will give the younger generation the opportunity to farm the soil that their predecessors farmed for many centuries previously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr Win. Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should congratulate the hon. Member for Ceredigion on initiating this wide-ranging debate. Apart from two contributions—from the English Benches—Committee members tried to tackle in a critical and constructive way the issues that the Government have to face to promote a prosperous future for Welsh agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the need for a healthy and vibrant rural economy, which must be able to make a significant contribution to the overall prosperity of Wales. Although only a small number of people are involved, the rural economy is vital in geographical terms. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his opening speech,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
the diverse, sparse and widely scattered communities depend on support for economic well being and they help to strengthen Wales' cultural and linguistic base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employment objectives are necessary to achieve the social and cultural objectives in Wales, and wealth creation is necessary to pay for the environmental improvements that we obviously need. A strong rural economy is fundamental to our goal of sustainable development—a goal to which the Government are wholeheartedly committed. We are determined to safeguard the Welsh environment for future generations, but we know that it is not enough to protect the environment if we fail to satisfy people's basic needs and do not give them the opportunity to live to their full potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In February, the Deputy Prime Minister launched a consultation paper, "Opportunities for Change", seeking people's views on and ideas about our plans for a revised sustainable development strategy for the United Kingdom. Part of the consultation is devoted to our countryside, land and wildlife, and views are sought on what more could be done to promote sustainable management and improvement of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation exercise will have particular relevance to Wales. Earlier this year we announced that the National Assembly for Wales will have a sustainable development duty placed on it and we have tabled the relevant amendment to the Government of Wales Bill. The current sustainable development consultation process should help to inform the assembly on how it should deliver that duty. I hope that there will be wide participation in the consultation process from across Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to the wide-ranging nature of the debate and should like to respond to some specific points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley asked about labelling. I should like to set the record straight. A beef labelling scheme was introduced on 1 November, the purpose of which is to give consumers reliable information about the beef they buy, in particular where it comes from and how it was produced. We are examining ways to extend the scheme to all meat products. The information will cover fresh, frozen and minced beef and veal, but not beef products such as steak pie. To provide other than basic information about the weight and cut will require prior approval from the competent authority—in Wales, the Welsh Office. Before we verify such a scheme, we shall need to be sure that it cannot be cheated on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the end of 1999, a voluntary scheme will be in operation, which will become mandatory from 1 January 2000. We have established a scheme with Welsh Lamb and Beef Promotions and Welsh Food Promotions Ltd. as a verifier to help retailers meet the scheme's requirements and plug in full traceability. We are trying to publicise the scheme; at the moment, we have received only two applications from local butchers, which have been approved, We want to ensure that we receive applications from multiples and major wholesalers. More publicity will promote the scheme in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli asked whether milk prices depend on the high value of the pound. It is a complex matter. As support prices are paid in ecus, that does contribute to a high milk price. However, many also believe that the price is tied up with how the bidding system works for milk and how farmers seem not to receive such a good price, while consumers seem to pay what could be described as a reasonably good price to manufacturers. Milk Marque is already the subject of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission review; perhaps the issue will come under scrutiny and be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about Agenda 2000. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State introduced the subject, and several other hon. Members referred to it. Agenda 2000 reform is at a very early stage. I assure the Committee that the United Kingdom—and Wales within the United Kingdom—is presenting a strong case for reform that will provide a good deal for consumers and for both United Kingdom and Welsh producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South and other hon. Members asked about the spread of prices from mart to shop. The verdict seems to be that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs could ask the Office of Fair Trading to investigate the matter. It would be good to dispel doubts surrounding how prices in the market place seem so low while prices in the shops seem relatively high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon and my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire asked about the export of whole ewe carcases. Current rules prevent it, but because the scheme is not mandatory at the moment across the European Union, we negotiating with the French Government to see whether they would be prepared to accept whole carcases. At the moment, that is not so, but if they are prepared to do so, we would have to change our regulations to meet that demand. We are examining that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much was said about regional funds and objective 1 status. Significant negotiations are taking place on how best to have the case for objective 1 status for west Wales represented through the United Kingdom to the European Union. That will require a joint approach from the whole of Wales with Welsh Members of Parliament, Welsh local government and the Welsh farming unions backing our proposal because it will be difficult to win the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire referred to an alleged cut in HLCA of 25 per cent. There was no cut because his Government made a one-off payment. It was explicitly said to be a one-off payment and was not built into the HLCA. The Commission would not allow that because that was not the purpose for which the HLCA was created. We have not reduced the HLCA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gower referred to the previous Government's cut of £7 million in spending on further education. The Secretary of State restored £5.4 million of that in the 1998 public expenditure survey statement in December and, thanks to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, a further £3.5 million was provided, as my hon. Friend the Member for Neath announced on 2 April. We have restored that cut and colleges will be able to bid for that money.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I1179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
The vexed question was raised of why farmers do not benefit from currency movements. The reason is that we must repay that money to Europe, so there is no advantage to the United Kingdom Exchequer from any movement in the exchange rate for us to draw on for agri-money compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past 12 months the Government have provided £2.5 billion to alleviate the effects of BSE on farmers. We have continued to press for the beef export ban to be lifted and the first step has been taken for Northern Ireland. Compensation amounting to £12.2 million of agri-money has been provided, as well as £35 million for start-up costs and first year running of the cattle tracing scheme and £35 million for the new specified risk material regulations. We are in the process of putting together a new all-Wales agri-money scheme. We have funding for the development of an
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
advanced-profile telecommunications system in Wales and publication of an economic structure paper. The welfare to work programme has got off to a good start in rural Wales. We have revised planning to encourage industry in rural Wales. Legislation will provide an enhanced Welsh Development Agency and a new rural partnership, which I shall have the pleasure of chairing. That will provide the long-term strategic goal to which my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth referred. We shall see real light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
