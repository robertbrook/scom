<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
Rate Capping</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p>1. <span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on rate capping in the local government expenditure decision for 1998–99. (19375)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced his plans for individual local authority spending on 10 December. He discussed them yesterday with the Welsh Local Government Association at a Welsh consultative council meeting on local government finance. We also have the opportunity this morning to discuss the plans during our debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that under those plans my local authority of Carmarthenshire will receive an increase of 4.4 per cent. in the standard spending assessment and 4.3 per cent. in the maximum allowable budget. My constituents will be grateful for those increases. Can my hon. Friend say whether it is the Government's policy to phase out rate capping over a period of years, as the Government promised at the last election? If the people of Carmarthenshire and our councillors wanted to spend, say, £1 million more on education, would they be allowed to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is the Government's policy to phase out rate capping. At present, two parallel pieces of work are being undertaken to help bring about that process, one of which relates to the best-value project. A week or so ago, I announced that 23 best-value projects would be taking place in Wales, out of the 26 that were put before us. In addition, we plan early in the new year to publish consultative papers on how to improve local democracy— part of which will be to try to ensure that there will be other means by which councils can consult their electorates on matters such as their spending plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's Herculean efforts in respect of local government finance, but the assessment is absurd. Merthyr county borough is the only county borough and county council in this year's settlement to receive a reduction of £1 million in its standard spending assessment. It is facing the highest council tax and 8 per cent. cuts in services. A system that leads to a county borough, with its indices of deprivation, facing a reduction in its standard spending assessment of £1 million is crazy. Why has it happened? The local authority referred to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
by my hon. Friend the Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Mr. Williams) will have a 4.4 per cent. increase. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Local Government Association undertook a review of the formula, and this year's allocations have been based on the new formula agreed by the association, following consultation. Despite the fact that Merthyr came out badly, it will still be able to increase its spending by about 4 per cent., although, as a result, its council tax will increase.<br><br>
I must emphasise that Merthyr still has the highest per capita spending in Wales. We have agreed with the Welsh Local Government Association that the same formula will be used for this year and next, but there will be a fundamental review to find the best new formula to treat all councils in Wales fairly.</span></p>

Education Improvements</div> <!-- title -->
<p>2. <span class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What plans has he to improve primary and secondary school education in Wales; and if he will make a statement. [19376]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The School Standards and Framework Bill, which was given its First Reading on 4th December, provides for smaller infant classes and places a duty on local education authorities to support schools in raising standards. We have set a new and challenging all-Wales target to raise pupils' standards, especially in literacy and numeracy. We have also provided £50 million extra for schools' budgeting and £65 million extra for much-needed renovation and repair work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Jones, for arriving late this morning.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for his answer. Will our right hon Friend the Secretary of State undertake to look again at his announced provisional capping limit for Conwy county borough council, as rate capping has presented the authority with major problems? In doing so, will he bear in mind that until the new unitary authorities came into being, many Conwy schools were in the county of Gwynedd, where the authority has been able to make a more substantial financial provision for schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I simply add that, of the additional money provided for schools' budgets, £1.65 million will go straight into Conwy schools' budget. It is also planned for more than £317,000 to go into capital investment in schools.<br><br>
I take this opportunity to tell my hon. Friend that I hope that all local authorities will ensure that that £50 million extra funding for schools' budgets is genuinely treated as additional money and that there is no attempt to slice it off from the education budget—the overall dispensation decided by local authorities—after hearing my right hon. Friend's announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, despite the priority that the Government have given to education, because of this year's overall local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
authority settlement Ynys Moôn county council believe that there will be a further cut of 2 per cent. in its budget? That will inevitably mean a cut in education because, in revenue terms, that is the largest part of the settlement.<br><br>
The capital settlement for Anglesey is the worst for any county in Wales, which means that the council will be able to begin only one project in the next financial year, but will not even be able to complete it. Will the Secretary of State look again at the capital settlement for the island?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's frustration about the tough settlement that was necessarily put in place this year. However, I urge him to look closely at the additional finance that has been provided for school budgets, because that should allow local authorities to move forward with confidence. Without that additional funding, and under the previous Government, even more savage cuts would have been imposed than have been visited upon Anglesey in the last couple of years.</span></p>

Farming</div> <!-- title -->
<p>3. <span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What action he proposes to take to combat problems currently faced by Welsh farmers. [19377]</span></p>
<p>6. <span class='member'>Mr Cynog Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has received on current problems being faced by Welsh farmers. [19380]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have received a large number of representations. In addition to those personal representations, I have had several meetings with representatives of both farming unions in Wales—the National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales—the Country Landowners Association and representatives of unofficial farmers' leaders. As a result of those representations, I am currently having discussions with Cabinet colleagues and with the Agriculture Minister of the Irish Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to congratulate farmers on the responsible way in which they have undertaken their representations at such an acutely difficult time for the industry? The right hon. Gentleman will be aware of the industry's expectation that a statement will be made before Parliament goes into recess. Will he give an assurance that that statement will not only relate to the short-term caseflow crisis that faces the beef industry and the whole farming sector, but will address the long-term problems and guarantee a level playing field for exports? When does the right hon. Gentleman expect progress to be announced on a lifting of the ban?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked several questions. I had a meeting last Friday with representatives of the farming unions, when I made it clear that the Government expected farmers who were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
legitimately exercising their right to protest to do so responsibly. I am delighted that, over the weekend, farmers have exercised that legitimate right lawfully and in a way that carries public support. I am pleased that they have done so.<br><br>
We expect to make a statement before the House rises next Monday. That statement will, I hope, deal with the concerns expressed by the right hon. Gentleman. It will not only deal, as far as is possible, with the short-term problems of the industry, it will lay down a strategy for the long-term success of British agriculture, which must address the matters to which the right hon. Gentleman refers—the current crisis in the beef industry, the problems arising from the export ban and the difficulties resulting from the high pound.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I emphasise to the Secretary of State that what is at stake is not only farmers' income, important as that is, but the rural economy in its entirety and the social structure of rural areas? It is important to understand that the future of a whole economic sector is at stake; the situation is very grave indeed. When farmers make a loss, the rural economy makes a loss and, these days, farmers are, in a literal and real sense, working at a big loss in production.<br><br>
The farmers will be satisfied only if the Government's statement is comprehensive and addresses the immediate cash situation. Will the Government undertake a comprehensive inquiry into imports, so that the matter is properly and thoroughly understood and measures can be brought forward to deal with the unsatisfactory aspects? We should seriously look at the sourcing policies of supermarkets, as the discrepancies in the way that supermarkets treat different sources of food are a cause of great concern and dissatisfaction. The export ban must be seriously addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a number of points, which I shall try to answer. I understand the concerns that he expresses on behalf of rural communities generally. He will know that last summer I announced that we would develop an agri-environmental strategy in Wales, which I hope will put in place longer-term mechanisms to bring some confidence and security to rural communities.<br><br>
Following my meetings with farmers' representatives earlier this autumn, as part of the hill livestock compensatory allowances review, I invited representatives of the farming unions to meet me—they agreed to do so—so that the Government and farming unions could jointly develop a longer-term strategy. That is our response to the problems resulting from the insecurity affecting the whole of the rural community.<br><br>
As to the other matters that the hon. Gentleman raised, the Government intend to make a statement—but he should not read into that that any help is forthcoming. The Government are considering those matters and a full statement will be made. The hon. Gentleman will know that we have taken unilateral action following the refusal of the Council of Ministers to agree to our proposals on bone in beef; we will, of course, continue to be robust. As to supermarkets, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
have had discussions within the Welsh Office and my officials are in contact with them to find out how we can promote the best quality beef that is produced in this country—which is, of course, Welsh beef.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the news that there will be an announcement for our farmers before the recess begins next Monday. I also welcome, like other members of the Committee, the responsible attitude of both farming unions in dealing with what is, without doubt, a crisis—certainly for the farmers in Pembrokeshire whom I represent.<br><br>
May I reiterate what was said about supermarkets? The farmers feel that more could be done to put their point of view. Although I welcome my right hon. Friend's announcement that his officials are meeting supermarket representatives, I stress that the farmers whom I represent feel that pressure needs to be applied to ensure that supermarkets act as responsibly as the farmers have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct—there are concerns among the farming community that some of the beef entering this country for retail sale does not meet the high standards expected from British producers.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend that the Government will take every possible action to ensure that proper standards are enforced. We are part of a single market and British consumers should be able to choose. If they wish to purchase beef produced abroad, they should be free to do so. However, I want to ensure that such choices are informed choices and I believe that we—the Government, the farming unions and British supermarkets—can do more to promote our products, which are of the highest quality. That is what I am trying to ensure.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend for her earlier comments. I know that feelings are running high in her constituency, but she can assure the farmers with whom she is in touch that the responsible way in which they have conducted themselves over the past few days has created the conditions that enable the Government to look at the problems and, in due course, make a measured response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Secretary of State give me guidance on how I can help a farming constituent? He took five heifer calves to market on 1 December and received £15 for them— £3 each; he was charged a commission of £12.50 and VAT of £2.19—so he went home with 31p in his pocket, for five calves. That is the measure of the agricultural crisis in Wales; the market has collapsed. British taxpayers have funded compensation for continental producers who have undercut British farmers, particularly Welsh farmers. Will the Secretary of State please give some succour to the farming community this week, especially in the marketplace, because they no longer have a market for their livestock?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about the British taxpayer funding continental farmers. The British taxpayer has put about £3 billion of public money into supporting our beef industry. I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
criticise that; it is the perfectly responsible way in which successive British Governments have tried to respond to the collapsing confidence in the beef industry—which stems largely from the failure of the previous Government, almost 10 years ago, to deal with the problem of BSE. It is not unreasonable for us to point out that billions of pounds of public money are going into the farming industry.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) has drawn my attention to the problem of calf prices, but public money has been made available to support the calf processing scheme. However, there is no getting away from the fact that there is a crisis in farming. The Government understand that and are looking at ways to respond comprehensively to the points that the hon. Gentleman raised.</span></p>

Trunk Roads</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4. <span class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he will undertake a review of the regulations relating to the provision of noise mitigation measures for existing trunk roads. [19378]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have no plans to review the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I express my disappointment at that reply? There has been no review of noise mitigation measures for existing roads since 1975. Since then, several developments have made the problem considerably worse, especially on the A449— the road about which I have written to my hon. Friend —which is the trunk road south of Monmouth. It causes particular problems near the village of Llandenny. Although that concrete section of road was recently reconstructed, the noise problem has worsened—environmental health officers have described it as "oppressive". There has been an increase in traffic volume and an increase in the level of tolls on the Severn bridges. I therefore urge my hon. Friend and other Ministers to examine the issue of noise mitigation because as I said earlier, there has been no review since 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge my hon. Friend's persistence and expert representation on behalf of his constituents on that matter. I am well aware of the problem—one of my officials visited one of the sites with my hon. Friend. However, it is a straight question of resources. If the noise regulations were significantly reformed—although they were amended in 1988—in the direction that my hon. Friend is, understandably, requesting, the cost would be astronomic. That, bluntly, is the answer to his point.</span></p>

Household Growth</div> <!-- title -->
<p>5. <span class='member'>Mr Gareth Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on projected household growth in Wales to 2016. [19379]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Office published "1994 Based Household Projections for Wales" in July this year. It estimates a 14 per cent. increase in the number of households in Wales between 1994 and 2016.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that given the dominant role those statistics play in the formulation of not only national policy, but local government planning policy, there is considerable disquiet about their accuracy and their failure to reflect sensitive local conditions and environmental factors? Does he agree that that matter should be dealt with by the national Assembly for Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with my hon. Friend's last remark because we must have the best possible information for working out our future land policy plans. Whether or not we contest the accuracy of the figures—at this stage, I have no reason to contest their accuracy—I can assure my hon. Friend that we want a combination of existing provision that has perhaps fallen out of use, and we will ensure that brownfield sites are used. My right hon. Friend might like to know that more than half of the housing association developments are on brownfield sites. In addition, he will be aware that I have asked local authorities in Wales to look at creating greenbelts to avoid urban sprawl.</span></p>

Lone Parents</div> <!-- title -->
<p>7. <span class='member'>Ann Clwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What recent representations he has received from lone parents on opportunities for employment in Wales. [19382]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Welsh Office has received two letters about the new deal for lone parents. The new deal means that lone parents with school-age children will be invited to Employment Service jobcentres for help and advice on jobs, training and child care. The programme started on 21 July in Cardiff and the Vale, and will be extended across the whole from October 1998.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ann Clwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I can add to my hon. Friend's postbag, which is the result of just a few days. I shall be sending him and the Prime Minister copies of letters that show how dismayed people are about the Government's policy. We asked for a postponement of the cut to benefits until the other measures, which are welcome, were shown to have worked. The welfare-to-work, the new deal and the child care policies are all welcome, but cutting the benefits of those most in need is not.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend answer my questions in a straight way—in a way that the Secretary of State for Social Security failed to do the other day? In Cynon Valley, there are 1,500 lone parents and 234 jobs at the jobcentre. Where will the jobs come from? If a lone parent takes a job, but loses it because her child becomes ill or the job itself finishes, will she get the same benefit that she received before taking the job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge my hon. Friend's powerful article in <i>The Observer</i> on Sunday on this matter. I well know her concerns and those of her constituents. In the programme to which I referred, by the end of November the advisers in the new deal for lone parents had helped into jobs 111 out of the 318 who had been interviewed in Cardiff and the Vale, so a positive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
programme is being undertaken. However, the matters to which she refers are for the Secretary of State for Social Security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the position for lone parents in Wales is particularly difficult? It is worse than in any other part of Britain because of low rates of pay, a poor transport system and the fact that we have fewer child care places—those that we have tend to be taken up by parents with professional qualifications. Lone parents in Wales will be particularly hard hit by the decision to end the lone parent rate of child benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with conviction. The new deal for lone parents in Wales will provide job opportunities across the country once it is up and running. Child care costs will be built into that. In addition, the extra finance announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor for after-school clubs will assist with the problem, which was well articulated by my hon. Friend.</span></p>

GP Recruitment</div> <!-- title -->

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While there is no overall shortage of GPs in Wales, there are some pockets of difficulty. That is why I announced on 17th July the setting up of an equity fund of £500,000 to tackle local recruitment and retention problems. It is now for health authorities to identify areas of difficulty and to suggest proposals for resolving them. The Government have also identified in the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997 a range of flexibilities for addressing service needs and recruitment facilities. Those should be in place by 1st April 1998.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Caton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. Is he aware of the proposal for a network of salaried primary health care teams in the south Wales coalfield area, suggested by Dr. Julian Tudor Hart, the chair of the Socialist Health Association? The valleys have an increasing problem of retention and recruitment of general practitioners. They also have some of the most severe health problems in Wales. I hope that my hon. Friend will be prepared to think radically in trying to overcome those problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the proposal. National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997, health authorities will be able to respond to them. We will, of course, have to await the outcome of that response to determine whether and how many GPs are needed.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that Blaenau Gwent is one of the most deprived communities in Wales. I am sure that he is also aware that as a result of the recent settlement, council taxes will have to rise by 12 to 13 per cent. and services will have to be cut to the tune of £4 million, in addition to the £12 million cuts made in the last couple of years under the Tories. Will my hon. Friend comment on the response of the local authority to the cuts, as reported in the local newspaper the <i>South Wales Argus?</i> It said that the Labour council leader slams the Government over funding and quotes him as saying that the settlement is, "Worse than the Tories".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That headline does not reflect the settlement made this year. We have provided an extra £125 million for Welsh local government. Although I appreciate that it is a difficult settlement, the broad details were previously agreed with Welsh local government. As I understand it, the proposed cut in the Blaenau Gwent budget is based not on last year's budget, but on the draft budget for this year. We are still negotiating with local government about the final outcome of the settlement.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not have any plans to merge health authorities.

Government Expenditure in Wales in 1998–99</div> <!-- title -->
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ron Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of Government expenditure in Wales in 1998–99.</p></blockquote>
I shall begin with an apology, as my speech will be longer than I would have liked it to be in ideal circumstances. It does, however, contain a great deal of detail, so I hope that the Committee will forgive me for its length. With your agreement, Mr. Jones, I shall ask my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger) to distribute a summary of the main points of my speech after I have finished, which might be of use to hon. Members when contributing to the debate.<br><br>
I announced the main elements of my spending plans to the House on 10 December, in answer to a written question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Caton)—although I am not sure whether I can continue to call him my hon. Friend. No one can now accuse him of being a sycophant to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is a socialist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I can any longer refer to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) as my hon. Friend, either. I have never been one to shy away from hard choices.<br><br>
A number of factors have influenced the way in which I have set the spending plans for 1998–99. One of the most important was to ensure that I honoured our manifesto commitments and gave education and health the highest priority. In addition, I have had to make resources available to meet the accommodation needs of the National Assembly for Wales. We have also initiated a comprehensive spending review, which involves a close scrutiny of all Government spending in Wales. Work is under way, and every major programme for which I am responsible is currently being examined.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
I expect the review to be completed in the spring of 1998. That will help to ensure that I am better equipped next year to make informed judgments about where to target public expenditure to meet our priorities and to achieve the best value for money. As with many areas of our policy, it is important to prepare for the Assembly, and I expect the review to provide a sound basis for the Assembly to set its own priorities when it is established. When it is, Government business will be much more open. That is why I introduced a new process of consultation with hon. Members and with a wide range of representative bodies in Wales. The responses that I received to that process have, of course, influenced the judgments that I have made.<br><br>
One of my overriding priorities is to improve economic prosperity for people in all parts of Wales, which will require the development of a coherent and long-term strategy. In October, we launched a consultation document for an economic strategy for Wales, and I want to develop further the partnership with the private sector, the different agencies and local authorities.<br><br>
The attraction of greater levels of inward investment remains a fundamental part of our strategy for the regeneration of our economy. Inward investors have brought a range of benefits to Wales, without which our country would undoubtedly be poorer. They have brought thousands of new direct jobs; encouraged the creation of thousands of indirect jobs in component suppliers and service providers; diversified the industrial base; replaced imports; increased exports; enhanced the image of Wales; meshed management techniques with our own; and worked with us to encourage more inward investment. I have therefore made sufficient resources available next year to meet expected demands for regional selective assistance. No project will be denied to Wales for lack of funds under the regional selective assistance programme.<br><br>
Inward investment will remain important for years to come, but it needs to be complemented by a stronger emphasis on helping indigenous Welsh enterprises to grow and on creating conditions in which there are distinctive and enduring reasons for developing good quality, new Welsh businesses that have the ambition to grow and compete on the world stage. The only way to achieve that is to ensure that the public and private sectors work together in a partnership that is underpinned by sound team work between the various public sector agencies. I have allocated sufficient funds to develop that partnership.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I welcome yesterday's announcement of new jobs coming to south-east Wales, the Secretary of State will be aware that there is a strong feeling that such jobs should reach the western parts of Wales—the southwest, the north-west and the old western parts of the coal field area. How on earth can the right hon. Gentleman say that there will be adequate finance for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
that purpose when there is a £9 million reduction in regional selective assistance within the figures that he announced only last week?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two matters that the right hon. Gentleman raised are not related. In the current and previous financial years, there was heavy expenditure resulting from the location of LG in south-east Wales. That constituted a substantial investment and a commitment had to be made to fund it.<br><br>
I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for expressing support for the Acer project. It is no secret that we tried very hard to encourage Acer to locate outside south-east Wales. Our initial discussions were about a site that was much further west. The offer that was made to Acer would have been greatly enhanced had it accepted that site. Ultimately, however, Acer had to make a commercial judgment, based not only on the extent to which state aid was available, but on all the other factors that ultimately led it to choose the Wentloog site. That site was chosen because of its infrastructure, its transport arrangements, its access to Southampton—the main port for exports—and the availability of the comprehensive training package that was on offer.<br><br>
We tried to ensure that other parts of Wales were equally attractive, but the fact is that south-east Wales is the preferred location for such inward investors. It is, and will continue to be, my policy to work with the Welsh Development Agency to try to encourage inward investment out of south-east Wales and into the west and north-west. We will continue to work with local authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I finish dealing with this intervention? I intend to continue to work to try to ensure that economic prosperity is spread throughout Wales. I have given the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) and hon. Members from western constituencies that assurance privately, and I now give it publicly to the Committee. As long as I am Secretary of State, no project will be lost to Wales for want of money in the RSA budget.<br><br>
I will first give way to my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), then to my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mrs. Williams), and then to my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said that one of the factors that led to the establishment of Acer in Cardiff was access to Southampton. If that is so, is it not rather disingenous of people in the north-east to complain about such investment? My geography is rather rusty, but as I understand it Southampton is further from the north-east than from the west of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neither my right hon. Friend's geography nor his arguments are rusty. I agree with all that he has said.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my right hon. Friend's comments. I recently had a formal meeting with a representative from the Welsh Development Agency. I realise that my right hon. Friend cannot be blamed for the matter that I want to bring to the Committee's attention. I am worried about whether the Welsh Development Agency always presents the abilities of north Wales in the correct perspective. I have a Welsh Development Agency document promoting Wales entitled, "Telecommunications Equipment Sector", on the back of which is a little map showing the M4 corridor only. In my constituency there are telecommunications companies such as Austin Taylor, Ferranti and other small firms, so when the WDA publishes documents showing a map of the M4 corridor only, it is selling us short in north-west Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen a copy of that document, but if my hon. Friend will ensure that I have a copy, I shall take up the matter with the Welsh Development Agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will know from his constituency experience about the problem that indigenous investors have in obtaining support. The Welsh Development Agency has a policy for attracting inward investment—buy, buy, buy—but all Members of Parliament have difficulty on occasion in persuading the WDA to focus on indigenous investment. There seems to be no coherent policy for helping indigenous industries. Will my right hon. Friend apply himself to that matter because the bulk of industry in Wales is local industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept my hon. Friend's criticism of the responsiveness of the Welsh Development Agency, but if he has a specific example I shall be more than happy to take it up with the WDA. Before giving way, I said that the role of the Welsh Office and the Welsh Development Agency in supporting indigenous industries and creating new industries should be strengthened. To that extent my hon. Friend is pushing at an open door.<br><br>
Part of our general policy for economic regeneration is to create an economic powerhouse. I have already had discussions with the chairman of the Welsh Development Agency and have asked for proposals from the three existing agencies. I expect to receive those proposals soon after Christmas and I shall outline the form of the powerhouse as soon as possible thereafter. I shall make decisions on the structure of the agency when I have considered the existing agencies' proposals. In the meantime, I have been able to maintain the gross programme of the WDA, but the agency will continue to rely on receipts from the sale of some of its assets. There is, however, an increase of some £26 million of grant in aid to the agency.<br><br>
The receipts target set by the previous Administration for the Development Board for Rural Wales was unrealistic and has been revised downwards. That reduces the gross programme slightly, but nevertheless the level of resources being provided to the DBRW in 1998–99, together with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
receipts that it is expected to generate, will enable the board to undertake an economic development programme of some £17 million.<br><br>
Those figures are contained in the written transcript which my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire will circulate at the end of my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall finish my point and then give way to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The Land Authority for Wales is the third development agency. It is a self-financing, profitable taxpaying body which carries out a valuable role for Wales in assembling difficult sites for development. It has created a surplus which will not all be re-invested in new sites, and I have therefore recovered £1 million from the authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures on expenditure which were published last week in an answer to the hon. Member for Gower stated that the DBRW had had a cut of £500,000 in funds for the forthcoming year. Is the Secretary of State saying that that is not so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that as a result of the forecast being revised downwards there is a reduction in the gross programme. I accept that.<br><br>
In August I launched the 1998–99 Welsh Capital Challenge round. I set out then my intention to use the scheme to promote economic regeneration and development in the most disadvantaged areas of Wales. Welsh Capital Challenge supports an integrated approach to capital expenditure and provides essential supplementary funding to enable important projects to go ahead, ranging from major strategic investment sites to economic regeneration strategies in areas of deprivation.<br><br>
Competition has been fierce, with 20 of the 22 local authorities bidding. Choosing between the many excellent bids that were submitted has been a difficult exercise. The budget was almost three times over subscribed. In coming to my decisions, I have compared each bid against the detailed criteria that I set out in August. I have drawn on the advice of professionals from many different agencies and I have taken account of the numerous representations that I have received from local authorities and from right hon. and hon. Members.<br><br>
I know the importance that each local authority places on the success of its bid. Many local authorities will, of course, be disappointed that I have not been able to support them in the current round. However, all local authorities are receiving funding from the strategic development scheme, which provides about £38 million for local regeneration projects. Continuing funding for Welsh Capital Challenge projects that were successful under the previous round provides a further £10 million.<br><br>
Today, I am pleased to announce funding of almost £20 million over the next three years to support Welsh Capital Challenge bids from 12 local authorities. I am supporting bids—predominantly in the valleys and in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
north and west Wales—that promote sustainable economic regeneration or development and that create significant employment opportunities. The package includes support for three new regeneration strategies—in Bangor, Rhyl and the Dulais valley—which demonstrate close collaboration with the public and with voluntary and community groups. I am also supporting a further nine large projects, including three strategic sites for major inward investment opportunities at Velindre, Merthyr Tydfil and Oakdale, and further sites which will provide much-needed local investment opportunities at Haverfordwest, Barry, Tredegar, Deeside and Llangefni.<br><br>
In making my decisions I have looked to complement other Government initiatives such as the welfare-to-work programme and I am pleased that I have also been able to support, among other things, a new youth enterprise centre at Maesteg. Almost £18 million of the package is for access and infrastructure improvements to develop industrial sites and business parks. Local authorities forecast that some 700 jobs will be secured as a direct result of this funding and a further 8,000 jobs may be secured if the envisaged private sector funding of £130 million is secured.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There does not seem to be much—or any—money going to mid Wales. Is that because there have been fewer applications, or is there another reason?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only applications that could possibly fit into that category are those from Ceredigion, which was unsuccessful, and from Powys. I believe—and I shall confirm this subsequently—that the submission from Powys did not meet the relevant criteria. Perhaps there was a communication problem between Powys and the Welsh Office. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about Powys' bid in future years, he should encourage it to form a close working relationship with the professional advisers in the Welsh Office, who will help to ensure that subsequent bids meet the criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: And Ceredigion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same goes for Ceredigion. It, too, should have discussions with the Welsh Office. That should ensure that it meets the relevant criteria.<br><br>
To sustain economic prosperity, the training programme must be flexible and it must meet the challenges that are demanded of modern industries. In the discussions that we had in connection with the Acer project, which was announced yesterday, we had to ensure that training programmes were in place. I shall make £123.8 million available for training and enterprise programmes in 1998–99. I acknowledge that that is a reduction but it reflects the very welcome fall in unemployment, which is down by 26 per cent. over the past year, and the additional expenditure that is available through the new deal.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The new deal will commence in the west Wales pathfinder area in January 1998 and it will be extended to all areas of Wales in April 1998. Some of the new money will be available in Wales under that programme. I am giving the highest priority to equipping young people with the skills that they need to fulfil their potential and to help the economy grow. Virtually half—more than £60 million—of the total training and enterprise budget is being allocated to train young people. I want to place greater emphasis on catering for 16 and 17-year-olds and slightly less emphasis on those in the 18 to 25 age group, who could be eligible for one of the new deal options. That means that the guarantee of training for young people who are neither in education nor employment is being maintained, and no TEC in Wales will be prevented by lack of resources from meeting that guarantee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that mid-Glamorgan TEC has run out of money for modern apprenticeships, and will he ensure that, from the guarantee fund and the money that he is making available, we will continue to finance the modern apprenticeship scheme, which has really caught on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with modern apprenticeships in a moment, but I note my hon. Friend's concerns. I shall examine the problem in mid-Glamorgan and write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a problem with some disabled young people who do not claim jobseeker's allowance and are, therefore, not eligible for some of the schemes on offer under the new deal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. The funding that I have set aside will help to build on the success of modern apprenticeships. That will help the introduction of the new national traineeships and help disadvantaged young people to enter or return to work, training or education.<br><br>
From June 1998, the Government will be introducing a new deal for long-term unemployed adults. This will provide employment opportunities for people over the age of 25 who have been unemployed for two years or more. In addition to the range of support provided by the new deals for unemployed people, we will continue to provide training opportunities under the training for work programme. This will aim to improve employability and help unemployed people into work. During 1998–99, this will provide more than 6,000 training opportunities, at a cost of £15.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to my hon. Friend when I have finished dealing with this point.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the fall in unemployment in Wales, which is down by 26,100—that is 26.3 per cent.—over the past 12 months. It now stands at 5.9 per cent. of the working population, down from 8 per cent. last year. The size of the training for work budget reflects both the continuing fall in unemployment and the availability of a much broader range of training and employment measures for unemployed people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State clarify one point? He said that certain benefits and initiatives were available to people who had been unemployed for two years. Can that two-year rule be broken for unemployed disabled people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the new deal for long-term unemployed adults, which will take effect from June next year and which will provide employment opportunities for the over-25s in that category. I am afraid that I cannot say how the scheme will apply to disabled people, but I shall consider the matter and let my hon. Friend have a detailed explanation in writing. As the new deal develops, I shall explore what can be done to take account of the needs of disabled people.<br><br>
One of the obstacles to enabling unemployed people—especially women—to return to work is the lack of appropriate care for their children. I am making available an extra £600,000, in addition to the £300,000 already budgeted, to support the development of child care. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) announced last month that a working group was preparing a childcare strategy for Wales. This strategy will be comprehensive and will provide affordable childcare for parents who wish to return to work, training or education. The extra funding will contribute to the development of that strategy by extending out-of-school activities and other provision that will help parents and children.<br><br>
Of course, people work in the countryside, as well as in towns and cities. Today of all days, with the lobby of Parliament, colleagues will no doubt have the plight of Welsh farmers uppermost in their minds. Only a very small element—some £70,000—of agriculture spending comes from the block. The vast majority of provision is on a separate vote. The total provision for 1998–99 is £210 million, of which £156 million is from the European agriculture guidance and guarantee fund.<br><br>
Government support for agriculture therefore remains at a very high level. In addition to the support from the Welsh Office we continue to provide substantial amounts of money on various measures related to BSE. On a UK basis, that is expected to be more than £900 million in the current financial year alone. Despite that support, farmers' incomes have fallen during the past two years. There is no doubt that the industry faces difficulties in both the short and long term. In the long term, CAP reform and the next world Trade Organisation negotiation will impose changes on the industry at least as significant as that resulting from the 1992 reforms.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
The trend in agricultural world trade is towards freer access to markets, reduced export subsidies and lower prices. I have already invited the farming unions to join me in assessing how Welsh agriculture, in particular, can best meet the challenges that lie ahead. The development of the all-Wales agri-environmental scheme which I announced at the Royal Welsh show last July will be an important element in our response to the ideas put forward by the European Commission in its Agenda 2000 proposals. It is also a key component in the protection of our natural heritage. I have therefore provided an additional sum of £500,000 for the Countryside Council for Wales on top of its existing funding, to enable it to carry out fully all its key functions and duties.<br><br>
We all recognise that the industry has its short-term problems. The Government fully understand the position and I have kept in close touch with the leaders of the farming unions and individual farmers. We are considering the issues very carefully and, as I said earlier, the Government intend to make a statement before the House rises for the Christmas recess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the provision in the current spending budget for agri-environmental measures is lower than last year, at £36 million as opposed to £45 million? Is that not rather unfortunate in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman said about the importance of the agri-environmental scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales wants to refer to that point in his summing up. The point that I wanted to make was that additional money has been given to the CCW to allow for the introduction of the new agri-environmental scheme. Limited funds are available, and the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will see when the scheme develops that priority will be given to those schemes that deliver the best reward for public funds. The hon. Gentleman would expect that.<br><br>
I turn now to education, which is a matter of great concern to all members of the Committee. The 1998–99 budget reflects our over-riding commitment to raising levels of attainment in schools. We have set ourselves stretching targets for improvement in the White Paper for Wales—"Building Excellent Schools Together". We will achieve these targets only if all those involved in education—teachers, parents and pupils—develop a sensse of purpose and partnership. I am encouraged by the response that we have received, most recently in the meeting that the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), held with chairs and directors of education on 5 December.<br><br>
If we are to raise standards in schools, our priority must be to direct more money to shcools. Under the new deal for schools, we shall provide an additional £50 million in revenue support. That will allow school budgets to rise, not fall. It reflects our pledge to increase the proportion of national income spent on education over the course of this Parliament.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
We are also making additional capital funds available under the new deal for schools announced earlier this year by the Chancellor. This amounts to £65 million over the lifetime of this Parliament: £5 million is being made available in 1997–98 and will benefit over 700 schools and £15 million is to follow in each of the next four financial years. That should enable local education authorities to make significant progress in tackling the backlog of repairs required to poorly-maintained buildings.<br><br>
We are also taking steps to reduce infant class sizes. Resources freed by the phasing out of the assisted places scheme will be passed on to local authorities, so that by 2002 infant classes have 30 pupils or fewer. More than £1 million is being made available as grant in 1998–99 to help local authorities to start to implement their plans to reduce the size of classes.<br><br>
We shall target the new funds at schools whose standards will gain maximum benefit from them. The need to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the core skills of literacy and numeracy will be at the heart of our new standards agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned about some elements of the Education Bill that will come before the House next Monday—especially the fact that smaller primary school classes will come about through the diktat of legislation. Passing legislation to oblige schools to keep classes below 30 pupils is a significant removal of power from local authorities. Will the Secretary of State implement this legislationby-regulation in Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will understand that I do not wish to pre-empt Monday's debate, and neither do I wish to pre-empt decisions that may be made by the Assembly in two years' time. Suffice it to say that the Government's objective, which I warm-heartedly support, is to reduce class sizes. The considered view of the Department of Education, and of my hon. Friend the Member for Neath, is that the best means of ensuring that is by this legislative provision. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a libertarian in all matters—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsidiarity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could have an interesting discussion about that. It seems important first to ensure a guarantee to all parents in all parts of Wales that their children will be educated in classes with a maximum of 30 pupils, because that was our manifesto commitment. I would not easily be party to a scheme that, for reasons of convenience or political prejudice, allowed local authorities to opt out of it. Minimum standards are required and, if we must legislate, so be it.<br><br>
We shall make available £1.5 million of the £50 million additional revenue to support local authority-led literacy initiatives. There will be sufficient resources to extend summer literacy schemes so that there is at least one in each local authority area. We shall also devote resources within the extra £65 million capital
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
provision to the development of the national grid for learning: we intend it to become an invaluable tool for teachers and pupils.<br><br>
We are taking action in higher education. On 5 November, my hon. Friend the Member for Neath announced that this year's allocation will make available an additional £10 million for higher education in Wales in 1998–99. That money will be used to improve and maintain quality; it will also make possible investment in urgent infrastructure needs for teaching and research, and in student support to promote wider access.<br><br>
For further education, I have taken a major step toward reversing the deep cut originally planned following decisions taken last year. This effectively gives an increase of more than £5 million on the inherited plans for next year. The sector will also be able to take advantage of money available under the new deal programme and the right-to study initiative.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept, nevertheless, that that is a cut in real terms as compared with last year's expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can bandy about figures for as long as we wish. I have inherited a programme; I am attempting to ensure that, within the amount available, our spending plans for next year reflect our priorities. The Government's priority is to put more money into further education; after all, we have made available an extra £5 million on top of next year's allocation. The hon. Gentleman may present that in whatever way he wishes. The further education sector will have £5 million more than it would have had if the previous Government had still been in office. The Government can take some credit for that.<br><br>
Hon. Members will recall that on 3 July I announced a strategic review of the trunk roads programme, and that on 31 July my hon. Friend the Member for Neath published a consultation document that set out some of the options. We are currently considering responses, and are grateful for the thought put into their contributions by so many organisations and individuals. We shall announce the results of the review next year. In those circumstances it would be wrong to commit ourselves to new schemes—if, indeed, the public expenditure position allowed us to do so. However, the provision for the Government's roads programme is sufficient to allow us to complete the major structural renewal scheme on the A449 between Usk and the M4, to continue with the construction schemes that are under way—notably the A40 Carmarthen eastern bypass—and to maintain the network to an acceptable standard.<br><br>
On the question of transport grants to local authorities, we are for the first time supporting packages of integrated transport schemes, including a safe-routes-to-school initiative in Wrexham, an integrated strategy for eastern Swansea and bus priority improvements and park-and-ride facilities in the south Wales valleys. However, no new local authority road schemes will be started in the coming
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
financial year. We shall consider matters afresh in the context of the White Paper on integrated transport that the Government plan to publish next year.<br><br>
I want close co-operation with local government in all the work of the Welsh Office. Local government is independent and must be accountable. Those principles are contained in the White Paper that I am planning to publish next year on local government in Wales. The Government are entitled to insist on minimum standards—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon.<br><br>
Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) should understand why some of my right hon. and hon. Friends are a little sensitive about such matters. Some of them have had the misfortune of living in areas with Conservative local authorities. The Government want to ensure that following the setting of minimum standards there will be no opportunity, should the misfortune of local authorities falling under Conservative control again occur, for those local authorities to fall below the relevant minimum standards on which the Government insist. I know that the hon. Gentleman would like to bask in what he regards as the luxury of a non-Labour local authority in his constituency, but we want to ensure that the minimum standards that we demand for our local authorities are available to the very good citizens of his local authority, too—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I really do not want to provoke the hon. Gentleman. We have had an exchange on these matters and we understand each other's point of view.<br><br>
The seperate and distinctive White Paper for Wales, which I know the hon. Member for Ceredigion is dying to welcome, will range widely and cover democratic and financial issues. In developing its policy framework, I am committed to working closely in a strong and effective partnership with local government. That relationship will provide a strong basis for local government's relationship with the Assembly. The chairman and leader of the Welsh Local Government Association and I have agreed a framework for improving the way in which central and local government business in Wales will be handled in the run up to the Assembly. The "Framework for Partnership in Wales" was signed yesterday. The hon. Member for Ceredigion will be relieved to know that the leader of his local authority was present throughout the relevant cordial and agreeable discussions. I shall happily give way to the hon. Member for Ceredigion now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Dafis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit late now, but nevertheless I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Decisions on class sizes are taken not by local authorities, but by schools. There is a strong argument for allowing schools discretion on prioritising. A school might decide that it would prefer a class of 33 rather than 30 children, to release resources for something useful to be done elsewhere in the school. To take away that discretion is to make the running of the school an inflexible business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle must be that the Government honour their election manifesto. I acknowledge that there are difficulties, particularly in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
smaller rural schools, in arriving at a proper approach to the matter. Such points are for the detail of ther relevant Bill, however, not for the Welsh Grand Committee.<br><br>
To return to my previous remarks, next year's spending within the Welsh Office block will be £3.091 billion—an increase of 4 per cent. on the current year. That includes £353 million for police authorities—up by 3.6 per cent. I propose central Government support of £2.702 billion. That is a rise of 3.2 per cent., which is higher than the rate of inflation. Both spending and central Government support include the additional £50 million for schools that I previously announced, £21 million extra for community care and more than £41 million extra for nursery education. The last figure is made up of the £37 million previously wasted on nursery vouchers and an additional £4.5 million to provide all four-year-olds with at least part-time nursery education from September 1998.<br><br>
Capping will be retained initially, but councils will have far more discretion next year in deciding their budgets. Local authorities in Wales will have headroom to increase their spending by about £127 million or 4.8 per cent. on 1997–98. Police authorities have headroom for a £13 million, or 3.8 per cent., increase in their expenditure. If all authorities budget right up to their caps, it will mean an average increase at band D of £60 a year—a little over £1 a week.<br><br>
In the absence of action by me, some council tax payers would face increases well above the average. I propose, therefore, to introduce a damping scheme that will limit council tax increases, excluding community council charges and business rate relief, in cash terms.<br><br>
Most Welsh council tax payers live in properties in council tax bands A, B and C. The maximum increase for those people will be 90p, £1 and £1.10 a week respectively. The figures for those living in properties covered by higher bands will be proportionately higher. However, even for those living in band H properties, which are valued at £250,000 or more, the weekly increase will be limited to £2.70.<br><br>
The Welsh Local Government Association has told me that local government as a whole will aim to secure efficiency savings of 1 per cent. in the coming financial year. If only 0.5 per cent. of any savings achieved are used to keep council tax increases down, the average increase for band D properties can be held to about £50—less than £1 a week. That is my clear expectation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says, "Oh", but I am sure that he is grateful for the extra funds that will be put into all the programmes that I have outlined. We have redirected priorities, but we have inherited a difficult set of circumstances. The hon. Gentleman fought the general election on a promise of increasing direct income tax. However, he has now taken exception to my suggestion that householders pay a very modest contribution. I tell him frankly that if there are to be increases in expenditure, the money has to be raised somehow.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
The provision that I have made for capital expenditure by local authorities involves a mix of capital grants and credit approvals of £424 million. The biggest single component of that is the £127 million available for discretionary expenditure by local authorities. It also involves an increase of 4 per cent. over this year's provision for schools. That again reflects the priority that we attach to education.<br><br>
I should say a few words about funding for the Assembly. Next year, I have set aside sufficient funding to meet accommodation costs, as forecast in the White Paper, of up to £17 million and to cover expenditure on preparations for the Assembly, including investment in new technology and making a start on the recruitment of Assembly support staff. For future years, the White Paper explained that there would be additional running costs for the Assembley of £15 million to £20 million a year. My intention is to stay within that forecast.<br><br>
I have talked about the economy and employment in Wales. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) is responsible for issues affecting the quality of life. I know that he wants to improve access to housing through the rented sector. Housing associations are using £5 million from their reserves and the Government are matching that pound for pound. That will increase the number of new homes to be started to 2,300, an increase of 500 on the inherited spending plans. I am also ending the low-cost home ownership target within that programme. The extra resources mean that 1,000 more homes can be provided for rent than previously planned to meet the needs identified in councils' housing strategies. I am retaining the social housing grant next year at 56 per cent.<br><br>
For local authority housing capital programmes, I am providing £214 million, an increase of 11 per cent. on the inherited spending plans. That includes more than £125 million for renovation grants; £33 million for council house improvements; £30.9 million which I am distributing under the capital receipts initiative; and provision of £ 14 million and £10.6 million for area renewal and estate partnership respectively.<br><br>
I am ending the separate top-slice programme for low-cost home ownership schemes. Councils will still be able to provide assistance from their other resources where they judge that there is a local need for it.<br><br>
A matter of concern both to me and to the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, is that the fact that average grants given by councils have been falling for some years, as the greater problems of unfitness are progressively tackled, means that many people still do not have access to improvement grants. We shall encourage councils to use their flexibility to target resources in the most cost-effective way and to take a critical approach to grant work to establish what is genuinely needed to tackle unfitness.<br><br>
I apologise for having spoken for so long, but I want to deal with health, as that is one of our key priorities. We have been able to increase spending in a way that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
will have the greatest impact. The total national health service budget in Wales of £2,445.2 million includes the additional £60 million announced by the Chancellor in the July Budget. I have been able to add a further £1.3 million out of Welsh Office block resources.<br><br>
Provision in the next financial year will therefore be £113.7 million more than in the current financial year and the national health service in Wales will receive a 4.9 per cent. cash increase—in real terms, that is a 2.1 per cent. increase in expenditure. Taking account of inflation, that will mean a further £77.3 million—an additional 2.2 per cent.—for growth in hospital, community and family health services current expenditure.<br><br>
Although concerned to provide growth funding for hospitals, I was mindful of other priorities and found an additional £2.4 million to fund extra cancer staff, in line with Calman-Hine initiatives and our objective to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. A further £39.9 million is set aside to meet the increased costs of growth on demand-led family health services, forecast at 4.7 per cent. in real terms.<br><br>
I am also pleased to announce that the settlement will provide funding to start the radiotherapy equipment programme in Velindre national health service trust; that will be worth £4.4 million over the next three years. There will be a £2.3 million increase—5.3 per cent. in real terms—in minor capital provision to enable trusts across Wales to maintain and replace medical equipment.<br><br>
In the circumstances, this is a fair settlement for the national health service in Wales and will enable even more patients to be treated. I know that the underlying financial provision is difficult, but I expect health authorities and trusts to continue to manage their resources carefully; it is their clear responsibility to do so. I want to see further efficiency savings, with resources taken out of bureaucracy and put directly into patient services, and I shall make an announcement on the form of next year's efficiency target in due course.<br><br>
I have no doubt that the programme that I have announced today genuinely reflects the priorities of all members of the Committee. We are putting money into economic regeneration and we are funding a variety of schemes across Wales to ensure a fairer distribution of resources. We are looking most closely at those issues relating to quality of life that are covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. We are putting money into what we believe are the key priorities.<br><br>
We are developing a new partnership with local government to ensure an open and co-operative approach. We are laying plans—and funding them—for the development of a new democracy in Wales. We have embarked on a process of full consultation, which has allowed not only members of the Committee but colleagues across Wales to be aware of, and influence the development of, the spending plans.<br><br>
The process on which we have embarked is exciting and radical. When it is carried through to fruition, it will mean that we all live in a better Wales.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p>11.48 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd (Merionnydd Nant Conwy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by dispelling the rumour that has been circulating today, that the Secretary of State's speech writer died of exhaustion. Clearly it is not a rumour but is absolutely true.<br><br>
The spending plans for Wales are predicated on the need to stay within the previous Administration's plans rather than the need to meet the true needs of Wales. Wales has a basic, overriding problem of an appallingly low gross domestic product and that fact alone warrants an exceptional approach. It simply will not do for the right hon. Gentleman to give us the mantras about having inherited spending plans, having to make difficult decisions and so forth. Why should the people of Wales find their services cut and their economic development hampered because the Government have made a pact with the devil? Why should the well-heeled of middle England dictate the needs of the poorer areas of Wales?<br><br>
The poverty and degradation of some valley communities and the absence of basic amenities in rural areas are morally repugnant. If one indicator of a Government's success is how they close the GDP gap, the Government are doomed and will be seen as a Government who cannot offer Wales what it wants because they are tied to the apron strings of new Labour and its pragmatic approach to what were once core values and cornerstones of philosophy. Where is the respect for the weak in society: the one-parent families who merely exist from week to week on poverty-level income, the students who will be hard hit and who will probably give up any idea of further or higher education—and now even the disabled? With the Government, nothing is ruled out and nothing is ruled in. As we know, we are in a quagmire of reviews at the moment, where there is no bottom line to support any needy section of society.<br><br>
The Government have held that two areas are worthy of special attention. They are health and education. The health allocation next year will be £2.45 billion, which the Welsh Office says is a 4.9 per cent. increase in cash terms. In real terms, however, it is a 2.1 per cent. increase, which is below the level of inflation. So much for the Government's making a priority of health. The windfall tax was introduced in part to help bolster education, and in a written reply that I received about a week ago I was told that the windfall tax would enable the princely sum of £10 and a few pence extra per annum to be spent on each schoolchild. I do not know how much that will revolutionise matters, particularly when thousands of Welsh schoolchildren are in unsafe and unsatisfactory school buildings and when books are shared by as many as 10 pupils. The spin doctors may think that the windfall tax scam was a good one, but it is in fact a transparent nonsense hardly worthy of examination.<br><br>
In his press release of 10 December, the right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"by sticking to plans set out by his predecessor, he had faced a difficult allocation process."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
The Government have brought the situation upon themselves and it is unconvincing for them to continue to blame the Conservative Government's spending plans while sticking rigidly to them. It is illogical. I am sure that at some point in the debate the Government will remind us that the BSE problem is also inherited. That in turn presents difficult questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three billion pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Agriculture and rural Wales as a whole is in real danger of collapse and it will not do to hide behind the spending plans argument again. Spending plans are necessary, but any sensible or sensitive Government knows that if there is a crisis, there must be crisis measures to deal with it, which will inevitably include extra spending. The people of Wales are waiting for the Government to show that they have some regard for agriculture and for our rural communities. Hitherto, there has been precious little sign of that and I hope that there will be—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three billion pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has twice said "£3 billion"—yes, £3 billion has been paid but it in no way compensates the farmers, as anyone with even a slight understanding of rural problems understands. If the hon. Gentleman was to intervene, let him get up and make a reasonable point.<br><br>
The people of Wales are waiting for some sign that the Government understand their problems and the problems of rural areas. There has been no such sign from the Government. Many thousands of Welsh farming families are in dire straits. One positive step that the Secretary of State can take is to encourage supermarket chains to support the home industry. Before I am told that that is not possible—I understand that that was the view of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last week—I believe that it is possible. As a corollary, we could look at the way in which Treasury Ministers are now dealing with those who mis-sold pensions and so on. Action is largely voluntary, but a bit of gentle persuasion from the Government can ease things. I am sure that the Secretary of State for Wales and his team will realise that that would be a significant contribution.<br><br>
I hope that whatever happens this week will not be just a stopgap measure. I urge the Secretary of State, who understands the problems of farming—he was on the shadow team for some time before entering government—to find a longer-term answer. Farmers require security in order to plan ahead and we must consider the whole question of a sustainable rural community, which I am sure will be borne in mind by the Government. Whatever package is announced this weeks, I hope that it will not be an example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. It will not do to deprive one sector of the industry at the expense of another. All sectors— including the dairy sector—are under great pressure. Therefore, I hope that there will be a worthwhile announcement. We have noted that the wave of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
protest at Welsh ports has now subsided and I am pleased about that. Surely, it is now time for the Government to act.<br><br>
Hon. Members from all parties will wish to see the new economic powerhouse succeed and ensure that it is adequately budgeted for. In his written answer to the hon. Member for Gower on 10 December, the Secretary of State for Wales acknowledged that the training and enterprise budget would be somewhat reduced—he explained that in his speech earlier—but said that he had made provision to meet the forecast demand for regional selective assistance. Why has that been reduced by £8.7 million? Surely the forecast demand must be upwards and not downwards. If I am wrong, the right hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will perhaps correct me. Is it another example of creative accounting? Perhaps I have got the wrong end of the stick; I should be obliged if a Minister will respond to that point at some stage.<br><br>
We all welcome the projected increase in the number of houses to be built and the increased funding by Tai Cymru. That is a good step in the right direction and I hope that it will be maintained year on year.<br><br>
With regard to transport, we see again that rural areas have been hit to provide for the more populous areas. The A470 north-south road is appalling. Although there has been a recent consultation exercise, not enough has been done. I welcome the integrated transport schemes that are being piloted in the valleys; they are excellent and worthy of our full support. The main arterial north-south road has been the subject of many debates in the Committee and on the Floor of the House in the past 25 to 30 years. Not must has been done and it must be a priority in view of the advent of the Welsh Assembly. Whether the Assembly is in the south of Wales—I am using the jargon again—or the north of Wales— <i>[Interruption.]</i>—or the mid, does not really matter because the A470 is meant to link north, mid and south. Therefore, it must be a priority.<br><br>
As we have seen from the Secretary of State's letter of 27 October, the allocation of roads and transport for 1997–98 is £115 million and for 1998–99 is £102 million, which is a considerable drop, especially when we consider that the out-turn figure for 1991–92 was £169 million. This is hardly the stuff of progress. As I said earlier, the provision of £36 million for agri-environmental measures represents another substantial cut on the previous financial year. The right hon. Gentleman has explained that that is due in part to the increase in funding for the Countryside Council of Wales. I trust that in due course the Minister will comment on that.<br><br>
The settlement is far from dynamic and is unlikely to lead to dancing in the streets. It will cause local government the greatest disappointment.<br><br>
Local authorities share our concern about the diminishing roads budget, but, more specifically, there is widespread anxiety about road safety. Many councils now take unacceptable risks by not gritting roads in marginal weather conditions. According to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
the Automobile Association's Welsh spokesman, Adrian Ruck, many authorities hope that the winter will be mild and therefore have not made sufficient allowance for gritting. Powys council has announced that it will concentrate on gritting certain roads, that main roads only will be treated between midnight and 5 am, and that many roads will be gritted only in extreme weather.<br><br>
Not only the public but councils are at risk. Powys is one of several councils that have taken such steps. Those councils run a serious risk of litigation if it is proved that injuries arose due to their negligence. Mr. Ruck said in a recent article:
<br><blockquote><p>"I don't blame the councils, I sympathise with them...they see the funds they receive diminishing year on year. Our complaint is against Government. The driver in Britain pays over £27 billion into the Treasury annually with less than 20 per cent. of it being spent on roads and public transport."</p></blockquote>
The settlement will hit local government hard. For example, because of the severe cuts and the likely loss of more than £500,000 in the current financial year, Denbighshire is discussing whether to make 50 social workers compulsorily redundant.<br><br>
One of my local authorities, Gwynedd, may welcome the £50 million extra for education, but would go on to say that although every authority receives a basic budget increase of about 3 per cent., after allowing for the increase in education the general uplift in local authorities' ability to spend is only 1.2 per cent. The ten authorities in Wales that are unable to increase expenditure above that factor will have to cut services to meet costs. Among other unavoidable commitments are increased debt charges arising from the annual capital programme and the full effect in the next financial year of this year's pay award for teachers.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has not increased external support sufficiently to match the committed increase in spending power. Council tax payers will have to shoulder the burden of the difference, which will entail council tax increases of an average 12.5 per cent.—ranging from an estimated 10.5 per cent. in Flintshire to a whopping 17 per cent. for Powys. Clearly, there are hard times ahead.<br><br>
The extra resources for schools under the capital receipts initiative are to be welcomed. One longstanding problem for local government finance has been the operation of the standard spending assessment. I am aware of the recent SSA formula review, which will be effective from 1998–99. I am also aware that the Welsh Local Government Association supported that revised formula only as a compromise.<br><br>
However, I and many others believe that the formula needs to be revisited urgently so that it reflects several key issues, among them the rurality and sparsity of population and the seasonal increase in population, which substantially affect many councils in Wales and effect the two unitary authorities in my constituency—Gwynedd, and Conwy county borough council—more than most. Those two issues are of paramount importance. Together, they constitute a drain on council finances. That must be recognised in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
due course; otherwise, the allocations will be unfairly low, leading inevitably to cuts in services or substantial increases in council tax—or both.<br><br>
Conwy county borough council welcomes the increase in education spending, but says that the money will simply mitigate expenditure reduction rather than add value to that important service. The new money must be placed within the capping calculation and there would have been a real benefit if it had been disregarded for such purposes.<br><br>
Disappointingly, the provision for pay awards continues to be excluded from the settlement. That means that Conwy must absorb £1.8 million within its own finances, which will have an inevitable effect on services. Although trade unions have been approached about the possibility of wage freezes, that is not a feasible answer to the problem. The fact that Conwy's council tax will be the lowest in Wales by a considerable margin is not likely to be a matter that will be pressed in the settlement.<br><br>
The authority believes that the settlement goes far short of anything that can be considered generous and appropriate, given all the circumstances. In a short time, it has cut more than 110 staff jobs and feels that it cannot cut more. With a relatively young work force, the only alternative seems to be redundancy. The authority emphasises that local authorities are major employers and that the last resort of redundancy will need to be considered—if not this year, in future years—unless there is a proper resource base for local authorities.<br><br>
I understand that the distribution of government grant will be a responsibility of the Welsh Assembly and that it will be subject to an annual consultation process. I further understand that the Assembly will be able to make radical alterations to the system if it so desires. I welcome that and trust that the advent of the national Assembly will bring to an end what the Welsh Affairs Committee described recently as "the present annual lottery." I hope that the relationship between the Assembly and local government will be creative and one that is based on mutual respect and, thus, receptive to the views of those at the sharp end of service delivery.<br><br>
The Government's expenditure plans for Wales are hardly better than those of their predecessors. Indeed, if the Tories had offered such plans last year, there would have been uproar. No doubt we shall hear further about inheriting spending limits, having to make difficult decisions and so on. On Thursday evening, the Secretary of State defended the cuts in payments to lone mothers by saying that it was a manifesto commitment to stay within the Tory spending limits. That phrase is now becoming a little tired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very loath to intervene, but the hon. Gentleman must acknowledge that there are millions of extra pounds going into education and health, which are priorities, as there are going into job creation as the result of the Budget that was introduced in July. The basic spending plans have been accepted, but the Government have been very imaginative in the way in which they have made extra money available.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Government have been creative more than imaginative, but the right hon. Gentleman would not accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones: (Ynys Môn): Even given the extra money that will be allocated to education, for example, does my hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. That is the experience of Denbighshire and other councils. The Chancellor is talking about introducing a 10 per cent. tax rate in the spring and I suggest that plenty of money is sloshing around here, there and everywhere, so there is no need to attack the weak in society, such as single mothers.<br><br>
An increasing number of members of the Welsh electorate are asking themselves why they voted Labour. If they wanted Tory policies, they could have voted for them. That body of people has been joined by single parents and students, and will shortly be joined by disabled people. All of them are clearly vulnerable. The Government are rapidly becoming discredited. We are told that they have a great deal to do, but the experience of the past few weeks shows that they already have much to undo.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Bearing in mind the time, I urge members of the Committee to make their speeches as brief as possible.</span></p>
<p>12.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Jones. I want to add to the points that I made previously and to inform the Committee of the views of my local authority.<br><br>
Before doing so, however, I must inform you, Mr. Jones, of an urgent petition that has been brought to my attention, and which my hon. Friends have asked me to raise with you. It is about the draught from the window. It has been suggested that an urgent insulation job should be carried out in the Room. I must propose an amendment to that proposal. If you refuse to direct such an insulation job, Mr. Jones, members of the Committee should be eligible to apply for cold weather payments.<br><br>
As I said previously—and as most members of the Committee are aware—Blaenau Gwent is one of the poorest and most deprived areas in Wales. However deprivation is measured, one always reaches the same conclusion. A recent survey shows that Blaenau Gwent has some of the highest rates in the United Kingdom for heart and respiratory diseases and for cancer. About 41 per cent. of all families in Blaenau Gwent contain someone who is long-term sick or disabled. Blaenau Gwent has some of the lowest wage levels in the United Kingdom, and other measures, including the level of car ownership, show that we are near the top of the deprivation league. I know that part of the remit of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend, is the quality of life and I am sure that he will respond to my points.<br><br>
Local authorities have responded to the settlement by saying that the Government are punishing the poorer areas of Wales by rewarding some of the richer areas. I understand the logic behind the Government's policy, namely, that we must keep to Tory spending plans, but how many constituents have come to the surgeries of my hon. Friend the Minister and demanded that the Labour Government stick to the spending plans of the previous Government? I understand the need to stick to election manifestos if the alternative involves cuts in living standards, but most economists and financial commentators have argued in recent weeks that there is not a shortage of money. The Government should break their manifesto commitment but, instead of apologising, they should explain that doing so would improve the quality of life in Blaenau Gwent and in other areas.<br><br>
I know that the Secretary of State for Wales recently attended the centenary celebrations of the birth of Nye Bevan, which were held in my constituency. Members of the Labour movement—from left, right and centre—queued up to extol Nye Bevan's virtues and to explain his greatness and genius, and they were right to do so. However, we must not only extol his virtues and remember his life but apply his ideas to the problems that we face today. Many ideas that were expressed years ago are still relevant today.<br><br>
I have always argued that socialism should use the language of priorities. That is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago. My local authority says that the Government have got their priorities wrong in the settlement. If we could have the percentage increases given to Monmouthshire, a neighbouring authority, we would be £2 million a year better off. I am not criticising the amount of money that has gone to Monmouthshire. I think that it is grand. Although my local authority and I support the payment, we believe that we should be treated in a similar way.<br><br>
In a letter in the <i>Financial Times</i> a couple of weeks ago, the Paymaster General responded to the awful accusation that Labour was not a friend of industry. He said that that was entirely wrong. He reminded the correspondent that as a result of changes, for example in corporation tax, industry was £9 billion a year better off under the Labour Government. If Blaenau Gwent could have just a tiny proportion of that £9 billion, there would be a radical change in my community's quality of life.<br><br>
The local authority issued a statement which said that it needed £78.9 million to maintain services at current levels. Those services are nothing to boast about because they come after 18 years of Tory Government. In the last two years, that local authority, one of the poorest of Wales, has had to make cuts or efficiency savings—whatever fancy name people want to give it—of about £12 million. As a result of the proposed settlement, we will have to find
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
an additional £4 million of savings. I do not think that that is possible. Blaenau Gwent is facing a crisis and no one should underestimate the extent of that crisis.<br><br>
The local authority statement says:
<br><blockquote><p>"This proposed settlement is not a good one for Blaenau Gwent. At first sight the general uplift in total expenditure of 3.9 per cent. appears to be generous, however within this a large part of the increase is earmarked to specific initiatives which do not currently appear in the Council's budget. These relate to firstly Education where an additional £1.3 million has been provided but that has to be passed directly to the Schools and Education budgets as additional expenditure to that being currently incurred. In a similar way the additional monies for the transfer of Community Care responsibilities"—</p></blockquote>
a sum of £533,000—
<br><blockquote><p>"has to be earmarked to that service. These together form 2.7 per cent. of the increase so one can see that the remaining provision for inflation for all services is 1.3 per cent.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The remaining 1.3 per cent. has to meet inflation which is estimated to increase at between 2.75 per cent. and 3 per cent. next year."</p></blockquote>
The local authority concludes by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is disappointing that the Secretary of State having found a reasonable sum to uplift the total of Local Authorities budgets has earmarked so much of it to increase certain services without recognising that by failing to fund inflation for all services he is effectively undermining the service areas that he seeks to enhance."</p></blockquote>
When the settlement was announced, the council was, to say the least, somewhat angry. It is not an extremist local authority. It is a moderate council representing a particularly deprived area, but it was still angry. The quotes that I am giving the Committee are not mine—I am far to moderate a member of the great Labour movement to indulge in such statements.<br><br>
The leader of the local authority, Bernard Assinder, spoke to the press some days ago. He was with the Secretary of State on that historic day—18 September—when mention was made of the wonderul prospects for Wales in the months and years ahead. The leader of the council's comments including the following:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is the most appalling settlement we could have expected … In terms of the percentage increase we are being treated worse than if the Tories were still in power … It appears that the poorest authorities are having the worse settlement and the more prosperous are being treated very well … The formula is failing to take into account deprivation in many valley communities … We would have expected more from a Labour Government that we put so much faith in after the general election."</p></blockquote>
He went on and on. It gave him no pleasure to make those statements—like the Secretary of State, he has devoted his life to the Labour movement—but that is the reality of the situation in Blaenau Gwent, where the community is experiencing tremendous poverty. The current proposals are not helping; they are making matters worse. It is sad for me and for the local authority to have to say that, but it is a fact of life.</span></p>

The main thrust of my comments refers not to this year's spending in Wales, but to potential future cuts. In recent months there seems to have been a co-ordinated attack on the level of Government funding afforded to Wales through the Barnett formula. That attack has also extended to the ability of Wales to attract inward investment from around the world. I single out two people who have been involved in that attack—the chairman of the Northern development agency and the chairman of the west country development corporation. They singled out Wales as being an area receiving too much money from central Government.<br><br>
The <i>Western Mail</i> last Tuesday contained an article under the heading,
<br><blockquote><p>"State funding for Wales too good for too long".</p></blockquote>
<i>The Independent</i> today contains a half-page article in the business section stating that Wales is poaching from the regions. The argument is gaining ground and we must counter it, not only at ministerial level—I know that is being done very effectively—but each and every Member of Parliament in the Committee should do that. I have some statistics that will help.<br><br>
The comments of the two chairmen have been picked up by the national and regional press and have been amplified. Members of Parliament of all political parties in those regions have also taken them up and we must do something about that. The argument is that Wales has received too much for too long, but in relation to other regions Wales has not had it too good for too long. The Barnett formula was devised 20 years ago to try to bring the poorer regions of Britain—that is, Scotland and Wales—up to the national average. Unfortunately, that has not been achieved. The average income per household in Wales is still 18 points below the United Kingdom average. South-east England is way above the national average at 129 per cent. Wales has the lowest average income of the 12 regions in the United Kingdom, despite our success at attracting inward investment.<br><br>
Central Government's allocation of resources and spending is only part of the picture and the Barnett formula is only part of the global picture. Central Government can help the regions in different ways and I shall refer specifically to the civil service budget and the defence budget. The defence budget is £22 billion a year, which is a sizeable proportion of our overall spending. When parliamentary questions have requested a breakdown of that £22 billion according to regions, the answer has been that only the procurement element can be accounted for—one third of the total. I asked the Library to provide a more detailed breakdown of the whole defence budget, including personnel and procurement, and I want to thank the Library for providing that information. It has broken down the defence budget according to money spent per head of population in each of the 12 regions of the UK. Bottom of the league is Wales, where £126 per head is spent on defence. Top of the league—surprise, surprise—is the south-west of England, followed by our friends in the north; the two areas that have criticised Wales for receiving more than its fair share. The difference between the top and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
bottom positions is staggering. The south-west of England receives £714 per person from the defence budget, which is six times the amount spent in Wales. The figure for the north is £364 per person—three times the amount spent in Wales.<br><br>
Those huge amounts of money are being funnelled into regional economies. If Wales were to receive a similar level of funding to that received by the southwest, an extra £1,800 million a year would be circulating in the Welsh economy. To put that in context, our total grant from central Government is £7 billion, so it would give us almost an additional £2 billion. Imagine the jobs, prosperity and investment that that would create. Viewed another way, it is the equivalent of an LG factory for every year of the past 20 years, and probably one for each of the next 20 years as well.<br><br>
That defence money primes the regional economies, with knock-on effects in every other aspect of economic life. Imagine (Yeovil) without Westland, Davenport without the docks or Salisbury without the headquarters of Land Command UK. I do not raise that out of spite or jealousy; I do not want the defence budget for the south-west to be cut because it brings much needed jobs, prosperity and investment to the region, and I do not want the defence budget to be reallocated in favour of Wales. I merely ask people in the English regions to consider the global picture of investment and not to do down the investment and help that Wales receives from central Government.</span></p>
<p>12.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to be able to welcome the Secretary of State's presentation today, but it belies the sleight of hand in the calculations behind the local government settlement. I have seen the right hon. Gentleman looking somewhat unhappy at times, but if he adopts a Tory budget, I am afraid that he must hang by it. I hope that later during the Government's tenure he will be able to bring us better news.<br><br>
There are 11 losers and 11 winners among local authorities in Wales. As a result of the settlement, the authority of Powys forecasts the highest council tax in Wales for next year—an increase of more than 15 per cent. and possibly as much as 17 per cent. That would mean an increase of £70 for every band D household. That is a shattering blow, given that my constituency is more sparsely populated and has special difficulties.<br><br>
There is also a crisis in health. The Dyfed Powys health authority has imposed a £4 million cut in the Powys NHS trust budget over the next three years, which we regard as an absolute disgrace. That will lower the level of service and create problems, despite the settlement that has been announced.<br><br>
The cut of £500,000 in the DBRW budget is not welcome, given the situation in rural areas. When we compare that with the increase of £20 million in the WDA budget, it is obvious that some explanation from the Minister is required. Does it mean that the WDA is preparing to increase expenditure on rural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
areas in years ahead? Clearly, the stark figures presented today are not good news for development in mid Wales and the DBRW area.<br><br>
The situation in Powys is extraordinary and we should examine the figures for Powys as a means of illustrating what must be the effect on many other authorities. We understand why the Welsh Office has ring-fenced education—there was expectation of real new money on the table. The ring-fencing, however, has taken place within Powys county council's overall budget. There is no new money at all. The £2.2 million that Powys will receive for education has been ring-fenced in that way, but education itself should have priority, and in Powys it already does. We feel that if education were funded and ring-fenced in the same way as care in the community, we would be better able to identify whether any new money existed.<br><br>
The rest of Powys's budget has been affected as a result. All other services—social services, roads, community services and housing—have been left with only a 1.16 per cent. increase in funding. Cuts will therefore be made in other services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Liberal Democrats ceaselessly warned the Labour party that if its candidates stood on the promise of honouring Tory spending plans, Tory spending cuts would be the result?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely true. I believe that the Government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet answered my hon. Friend's question. I will give way in a moment. There is not sufficient money in the system to fund education properly. It is a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as a member of a political party that has not formed a Government within living memory, he might find it difficult to understand that if a Government are elected on a manifesto promise not to increase public spending it is right and proper that that promise should be kept? Will the hon. Gentleman not accept that the present Budget is entirely balanced, is pragmatic and reasonable in its approach, and is the best that can be done in the difficult circumstances inherited by the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly none of those things. It bears down on the poorest in society and those least able to cope, which is a disgrace. It is beyond belief that a Labour Government have introduced that type of Budget.<br><br>
In Powys, as a result of legislation relating to school transport, statementing and increases in pupil numbers that is already in the pipeline, expenditure will increase by slightly more than £1 million. That is why we are experiencing problems. After making the necessary calculations, it becomes clear that Powys has received an increase in education funding of only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
£36,000, which is almost a standstill. An increase in education funding of 0.07 per cent. is clearly not sustainable.<br><br>
The outcome for other services in Powys is a starvation of funding. The 1.16 per cent. increase to which I referred is way behind the 3.7 per cent. headline inflation figure. The result in Powys will be a 7 per cent. cut for all other services. We also had a 7 per cent. cut under the Tories last year, so that figure is pretty familiar. It means a 14 per cent. cut in two years. Last year we lost 150 jobs in the highways department in Powys and we will lose another 50 to 100 jobs this year. Those are valuable jobs in an area in which few jobs are available, and the results for the county will be catastrophic. If any Grand Committee members are driving through Powys this winter and they arrive at a snow drift that has not been moved, it will be a case of "Road closed by courtesy of the Welsh Office". Our roads budget has suffered massive cuts.<br><br>
We are robbing other services to achieve the standstill in education funding. Why cannot the Secretary of State ring fence the education budget, as is done with community care? That question must be answered. There is no new money. What has happened to the windfall tax receipts?<br><br>
The centrally minded decision-making of educational ring fencing diminishes the ability of local authorities in extreme rural areas to cope with other services. I remind the Committee that because of educational ring fencing, resources for services for the elderly and for roads will be reduced. Inhabitants of Powys are high consumers of services. Elderly people—whose numbers are increasing—and young people do not have the facilities that people enjoy in urban areas.<br><br>
Last week, Bristol university published a report that focuses on Powys. The Committee will be glad to hear that I shall not read it all. In the 10 poorest wards in Powys, spending is £100 a week less than in the 10 richest wards. There is therefore a great disparity and a low income rate. The gross domestic product per head in Dyfed and Powys in 1993 was 76.3 per cent. of the United Kingdom as a whole. that is a very low GDP per head. We believe that that question must be addressed: we cannot have settlements such as this, accompanied by reduced services.<br><br>
The current crisis in agriculture is the worst in my lifetime. There is now no market place for many livestock, so they are being taken home. We welcome the increase in the Countryside Council for Wales' budget, but that will not equal the 47 per cent. drop in farm incomes.<br><br>
I am sure that the Secretary of State will have been impressed by the representations that were made to him last week by the Young Farmers who visited Westminster at our invitation. I am sure that they made their point cogently.<br><br>
There is clearly a need for a green pound adjustment and an increase at least in hill livestock compensatory allowance payments to tackle the inequity of trading conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. How much extra would he put into the budget, from where would it come and to what use would it be put?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we planned at the election to put a penny on income tax, that meant putting £100 million into education in Wales. That would have been a substantial increase in real money, not phantom money.<br><br>
Powys has been hit with a double whammy: it has the highest council tax in Wales and the biggest cut in services of 7 per cent. The extra council tax is equal to the ring fencing of money for education of about £2 million.<br><br>
Finally, I offer a plea on behalf of the people of Powys. The wretched business of rate capping—which I am sure the Secretary of State does not like, along with every local authority in Wales—is responsible for the cuts in services. Will the Secretary of State consider raising that cap by 1 per cent. for Powys—from 3 per cent. to 4 per cent.—to enable us to have more resources to fund our local services?</span></p>

<p>12.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Julie Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is much to welcome in the statement. I especially welcome the commitment to child care—at least we have a Government who are examining the importance of child care, are recognising that it is needed, and are going out of their way to implement it. I welcome the £600,000 that has been announced for child care places. There must, however, be a Welsh solution for the use of that money. The out-of-school TEC initiative that was started by the previous Government provided short-term places. Many of those schemes did not survive in disadvantaged areas. We must carefully use that money to build on schemes that are struggling. We should not simply follow what is being done in England; we should have a Welsh solution.<br><br>
I welcome the setting up of the child care strategy group, which includes representatives from all the different sectors in Wales. Let us come up with something really good for Wales that is not just gimmicky numbers but looks at the real needs of Wales and long-term solutions.<br><br>
I also welcome the commitment to the new deal. However, some adjustments are needed to address many of the worrying problems that we have come across lately. Some people cannot take advantage of the new deal, particularly women and lone parents. The new deal options are open only to those who claim the jobseekers allowance. Women who have children receive income support and so cannot have any help from the employment subsidy or with training. Those are not available under the lone parent initiative. I do not know whether the Ministers can refer to those issues, but some adjustments to that scheme in Wales could help many of the lone parents whom we debated last week.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
I am pleased about the £4.4 million for replacement radiotherapy equipment at Velindre. Although it serves a wide area, Velindre is based in Cardiff, North. It is greatly needed. The £2.3 million added to the trust's provision to replace medical equipment is also welcome. However, I am worried about how we shall fund certain aspects of the health service in future.<br><br>
I am concerned about our dependence on private finance initiatives in the health service, especially those which tie staff in. There has been a ballot of Unison members at University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff about proposed contracting out not only of the building and equipment but of the staff who provide the sterile services unit in the hospital. I am glad that a review is being carried out. Their work is important and I hope that they will be able to remain with the health service.<br><br>
I am also concerned about how old hospitals are to be replaced. Whitchurch hospital in Cardiff provides a wonderful service to its patients but the building is very old. It is a listed building with miles and miles of long institutional corridors and unsuitable wards. Where are we to get the money to resolve these problems?<br><br>
One problem in my constituency is the limiting of the community care package to £107 per week per person. That means that elderly or disabled people who at present can remain in the community will have to go into residential care which, as the local authority acknowledges, is more expensive. There is also a threat to some very good specialist services such as the Alzheimer's disease day centre in my constituency, which is threatened with closure as there is not enough money to pay for those who use it.<br><br>
There are major problems in the health service and I should like to know how we are going to solve them in the long term, but I do not want to take away from the fact that I welcome many aspects of this settlement.</span></p>
<p>12.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Today's debate on public expenditure in Wales until the next financial year is central to the delivery of services to everyone in Wales, especially those who are most dependent on public services. It therefore goes to the heart of the Government's programme and their ability, or otherwise, to fulfil the expectations of the people of Wales when they gave the Labour party such massive support in the general election.<br><br>
In voting the Tory Government out, surely the people of Wales were expressing a judgment of Tory values, policies and expenditure priorities. It is against that background that an increasing number of people in Wales are seeing a Labour Government insist that they keep to Tory spending levels and patterns. They have started to ask themselves, "What on earth was the point in changing government if all we get is the same?" We heard earlier from the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) who brandished the local newspaper and quoted the headline "Worse than the Tories".<br><br>

In response to a written question from the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Caton), the Secretary of State for Wales said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government took the view that it would not be sensible to make hasty decisions about changing existing public expenditure plans."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 December 1997; Vol. 302, c. 580.]</p></blockquote>
"Hasty decisions"—in other words, in 1998-99, Wales will have to suffer, yet again, another 12 months of Tory spending levels and the stunted public service provision that that provides. We will have to wait until after April 1999—two full years after the Government came to office—before we see any change from the previous Tory Government's plans. What on earth was the point of electing a Labour Government if all that we get, year on year, is a continuation of Tory policies?<br><br>
The spending programme that the Government inherited from the Tories involves a reduction in the Welsh Office budget from £6.9 billion in 1995–96 to £6.6 billion in constant money terms for 1998–99. Those figures appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday, which described in detail their implications, including those for the health service. The report in the <i>Financial Times</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury confirmed yesterday that next year's allocations would also leave the NHS with a real rise in resources of less than 1.5 per cent. in spite of the extra £1.2 billion allocated by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, in his July Budget. The health service needs a real increase of about 3 per cent. to maintain a constant level of service."</p></blockquote>
That is what will be budgeted for next year and the Treasury has confirmed it. In the same document, it confirmed the reduction in the Welsh Office budget that I outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackie Lawrence <span class='memberconstituency'>(Preseli Pembrokeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have said that the increase in real terms is slightly less than stated. Will you confirm that it is an increase in real terms?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady please address the Chair when she intervenes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that it is an increase, but it is only half that needed to enable the national health service to provide a constant level of service to the people of Wales and the rest of these islands.<br><br>
The Welsh Office expenditure block for 1998–99, announced by the Secretary of State last week, shows a reduction of £6.5 million in the funding for the Further Education Funding Council and the Higher Education Funding Council; a reduction of £0.5 million for the Curriculum Assessment Authority for Wales; a reduction of £9 million for training and enterprise councils; a reduction of £9 million for regional selective assistance to develop job opportunities; and standstill budgets for tourism, sport, heritage and the arts. There is a reduction of £17 million for local government capital expenditure, and the increase in health service spending is being swallowed up to meet the cumulative debts of health authorities in Wales, as members of health authorities confirmed on the radio
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
yesterday. It is a budget for the 20th year of Tory policies. It is not what the people of Wales voted for on 1 May.<br><br>
Local authorities in Wales face another very hard settlement for the coming year. In some areas, the Welsh Office's inability to develop a fair and equitable distribution formula for sharing out resources to support local services is leading to the prospect of acute cuts together with unacceptably high increases in council tax.<br><br>
Before anyone starts to say that Plaid Cymru believes in increased taxation, I acknowledge that we do. However, we believe in an increase in income tax, which is a fairer method of taxation than the council tax. We also believe in removing the national insurance upper limit and in redirecting resources from programmes such as Trident to more socially acceptable expenditure.<br><br>
I draw the Secretary of State's attention to the position of my county of Gwynedd, but I readily acknowledge that similar problems face the members of other local authorities. We heard about Powys a moment ago, and the problems are also faced in authorities such as Rhondda, Cynon Taff, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Neath and Afan. In Gwynedd, we face cuts across the board of 4 per cent. in spending on top of a 12.5 per cent. increase in council tax, which is four times higher than the rate of inflation.<br><br>
In Gwynedd, the maximum band D increase will be £70. Similar increases will be made in Rhondda, Cynon Taff, Merthyr, Blaenau Gwent and in Neath and Port Talbot. Our band D charge will be £570 per household. That contrasts very much with the position of other authorities such as Monmouth, which has a much higher standard of living than areas such as Rhondda, Cynon Taff and Gwynedd. However, Monmouth has the lowest band D council tax and the lowest increase resulting from the settlement. There must be something wrong if we are left in that position. I urge the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office to consider the distribution formula for local government in Wales in the coming year. Emergency aid will be needed to keep things going.<br><br>
Time does not allow me to go into detail, but I want to refer to the predicament of the farmers. The crisis is the worst in living memory and it affects farmers not just in one sector but across the board. There is a need for a substantial package to be announced very soon.<br><br>
The total Welsh Office public expenditure programme for next year at £7.1 billion in next year's money terms, is just 1.3 per cent. higher than this year's figure. The increase is well below the going rate of inflation, so that means real cuts in spending. Wales needs an increase of £400 million to £500 million a year in public spending to sustain public services and develop the economic infrastructure. The budget within which the National Assembly for Wales will have to work is in danger of being constrained to Tory-determined spending patterns, and the new Assembly will be hamstrung from the start if that is so. We desperately need a new, non-Tory approach to public spending and a new distribution formula for Wales to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
get resources to where they are needed, rather than following a simplistic head-count pattern. Otherwise, the prospect to be faced by the National Assembly—set in stone—will be social provision frozen at the level accepted by the previous Government.<br><br>
The failure to provide adequate spending levels in Wales next year will hit the people who are most dependent on public services—the ordinary people of Wales who, on 1 May, voted overwhelmingly for a Labour Government and a change of policy. They got new Labour, but they did not get a change of policy on public spending. When the penny drops about the magnitude of the betrayal, new Labour will face a bitter day of reckoning at the ballot box in Wales.</span></p>
<p>12.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Win Griffiths)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to all that has been said today. I had hoped that the welter of contributions would have contained recognition of the fact that, while operating generally within the relevant overall public expenditure limits, the Welsh Office was quite innovative in setting down the trends that show our future priorities. I am, at least, grateful for the political perception of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan), who was able to point out examples of our activity that showed that we have at heart the well-being of the people of Wales, while she also expressed some of her own fears. Perhaps other hon. Members—even my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent, who has not been able to return to hear me respond to his remarks—have not been able to come to the same recognition.<br><br>
The point that must be emphasised with respect to local government is that the formula on which allocations have been made this year was agreed by the Welsh Local Government Association. The association asked for a review of the formula and, in discussion with Welsh Office officials, introduced the formula for this year. It was not imposed on the association by the Welsh Office; nor was it imposed on Welsh Office Ministers. We responded to local government requests and local government agreed to this year's overall deal.<br><br>
We all accepted that decisions within the deal would not be easy to make. However, under that deal we provided an extra £6 million to help with the council tax process. Also an additional £125 million that was not available under the Conservatives is being provided. I must brush aside the lack of understanding of some Opposition Members, such as the right hon. Member for Caernarfon, whose concluding diatribe showed that he has totally failed to understand that although we should have liked to spend far more, the manifesto on which we were elected included commitments on taxation.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of what we have done in Wales to overcome some short-term difficulties. We have included extra money for education, to be given to schools to spend. It is additional money which the Conservatives did not give and it will help schools with their day-to-day expenses. In addition, we have made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
capital allocations to improve schools. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out that this year 700 schools are benefiting from this programme.<br><br>
We shall put a new amount of more than £60 million into the health service in the coming year. This year, holding up the eighth wave to fundholders has released more than £2 million. We have put in an additional £10 million to help with the winter crisis. We are indeed trying to put money where it is needed. The welfare-to-work programme will have an extra £190 million—which would not have been there under the Conservatives—to help young people and the long-term unemployed in Wales back to work. I refute absolutely the Opposition's Jeremaic approach to what we are doing.<br><br>
We are doing a great deal in the housing sector. We knew that there would be problems because of last year's huge cuts. Hon. Members should consider the audacity of the then Secretary of State for Wales, who claimed that, despite cutting £20 million from the budget, he could still provide 3,000 house starts. In fact, there were only 1,800.<br><br>
Immediately after we came into office, I asked Tai Cymru if it could make a modest improvement and it said that it could manage a couple of hundred more houses. On this year's budget, I asked Tai Cymru and the housing associations whether we could find a way of levering in a bit more money from reserves. We came to a deal in which we would match Tai Cymru pound for pound and not cut the grant—which, of course, is lower in England. We maintained the grant and combined in a successful partnership which will result in the building, in the coming year, of 500 extra houses that would not have been built if the previous Government had been returned to power. There have been huge differences. Some 1,000 additional houses in the rented sector will be made available as a result of changes introduced by the new Labour Government. I reject strongly any suggestion that we are failing to make changes. Despite the budget difficulties, we are spending hundreds of millions of pounds of capital receipts on priority areas such as education and health. The list is almost endless.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North mentioned the child care initiative. We have put extra money into that, and we intend to develop a strategy that meets the needs of the Welsh people. The £50 million for education will not be covered by capping; it is genuinely additional money. Conwy, if it goes to its capital limit, will have a 4.6 per cent. increase in spending money. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor said, Powys will impose a 17 per cent. increase for band D council tax. This is because band D is low in Powys anyway, which reflects in part the lower value of housing and Powy's general economic position. Even so, it will be less than the Welsh average of just over £1 a week. Powys will, of course, face difficult decisions about whether to increase council tax to the limit or reduce it a little.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) mentioned RSA. We are putting into that budget an extra £6 million, which previously was not there. Agri-environmental schemes are not part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I1030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
block and we are discussing with MAFF what the final outcome will be. The Government have been unable to find from the budget provision the £35 million that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We are considering ways of ensuring that our agri-environmental scheme is successful. The budget settlement shows this Labour Government's intention to increase spending on education and health and to develop services that will bring about economic regeneration across Wales, in both traditional industrial areas and new rural areas.</span></p>

The additional £50 million revenue has been included in the local government revenue settlement announced on 2 December. It has been made clear to each local authority that we expect its general schools budget to be increased by its share of the additional resources plus a fair share of the general uplift in the settlement as a whole.</span></p>
