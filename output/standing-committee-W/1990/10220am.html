<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hunt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
In moving the sittings motion. Mr. Hughes. may I warmly welcome you to the Chair of this Welsh Grand Committee and congratulate you on your appointment to the Chairman's Panel? You have spent many distinguished years in the House of Commons and we look forward to many sittings of the Welsh Grand Committee under your chairmanship.<br><br>
We greatly regret the circumstances in which your appointment has come about. Mr. Hughes. We gathered yesterday for a memorable occasion in the House of Commons Crypt to remember Donald Coleman. We all have our own memories of him and we shall miss him enormously and also his contribution to the proceedings of the Welsh Grand Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased and proud to be back in the Chair of the Welsh Grand Committee. Like the Secretary of State, I regret very much the circumstances in which my appearance has taken place. We all appreciated the most able way in which Donald Coleman presided over our proceedings. We shall miss him very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The comments that have been made are most fitting. The tribute made by the Secretary of State will be appreciated by all Members of Parliament. All sections of the House of Commons were represented in the Crypt yesterday at the memorial service for Donald Coleman.<br><br>
I welcome you back to the Chair of the Welsh Grand Committee. Mr. Hughes. I am sure that you will continue with your excellent chairmanship—I am not crawling in the hope that I shall be called later in the debate. I wish only to say that you have come in the tragic circumstances of the death of a colleague whom we all respected.<br><br>
I wish to put on record thanks from the family of Donald Coleman for the numerous letters received by his widow daughter and sons from Members of Parliament. They appreciated yesterday's turn-out and thank the Speaker's Chaplain. Donald Gray for arranging the memorial service. Tributes should be made to Mr. Speaker for his remarks about Donald Coleman and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), the Leader of the Opposition. I also wish to put on record thanks from the family to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) for his remarks at the service in Neath.<br><br>
As Donald Coleman Was the Chairman of Committee for so many years it is fitting to put on record what we all thought of him. I thank everyone
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
for organising yesterday's tribute.<br><br>
Donald Coleman leaves another vacancy and that is on the Council of Europe delegation. As Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee, I hope that you. Mr. Hughes. will follow in his footsteps because I know that you like travelling above the clouds. back and forward to Europe. I thank you for allowing us to pay this tribute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, also, welcome you to the Chair. Mr. Hughes, and associate myself with the tributes paid at yesterday's service and today's Committee. Donald Coleman chaired the Committee distinctively, with authority and with humour. It is difficult to chair such a complex Committee with many minorities—including some on the Government Benches sometimes—but he did so in his particular style and I know that you. Mr. Hughes, will follow in that tradition. I want to add my sympathies to those expressed already to the family and hope that yesterday's service was of comfort to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome you, Mr. Hughes, to the Chair. We have absolute confidence in your impartiality and look forward, with great pleasure, to having you as Chairman. We also want to add our remarks to those made already about Donald Coleman, for whom we had the greatest respect. He carried out the Committee's work sincerely and effectively. We send our regrets and condolences to his family. He was my next-door neighbour in the Neath constituency and was involved in Neath opera, which gave memorable performances at the Adelina Patti theatre and. for that reason alone, his absence will be regretted greatly in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my tribute to those that have been paid to Donald Coleman, who presided over the Committee with great distinction. I welcome you, Mr. Hughes, to the Chair and am sure that you will follow in the great tradition set by Donald Coleman.<br><br>
I ask you, Mr. Hughes, to use to your good offices to ensure that in future hon. Members are given longer notice of the convening of the Committee and of the subject for debate. Although it was in the air for a long time, official information about this sitting was received only yesterday. The composition of the Committee was posted yesterday and it was only then that we learnt, with great pleasure, of your appointment to the Chair. If you would convey those views through the usual channels. Mr. Hughes, that would command general assent in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is taken and I shall see to it that the matter is looked into.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.38 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of rural Wales.</p></blockquote>
The subject of today's Welsh Grand Committee is rural Wales, which I Welcome. Since my appointment as Secretary of State. I have done my best to travel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0429">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
extensively throughout the Principality and have spoken to many who live and work in the rural communities, as well as to others outside the rural communities who care about their future. Together with representations from hon. Members, that has given me a keen appreciation of the great natural assets that we have in rural Wales and of the achievements of the people, as well as the problems and challenges that face them in future. I shall focus my remarks on the latter.<br><br>
Our long-term policy objective for rural Wales can be stated succinctly as the creation of a self-supporting market-based rural economy. In striving for that, we must acknowledge and respond to the special problems of structure and outlook that have followed many years of debilitating depopulation and to the need for diversification and for measures that also promote the valuable social, cultural and environmental features of rural society.<br><br>
The main engines for the creation of a self-sustaining economy and the encouragement of enterprise are the Development Board for Rural Wales, the Welsh Development Agency and the Wales tourist board, which work closely with other public agencies, local authorities and those with an interest in rural affairs. They have been responsible for a wide range of job opportunities in rural Wales and played key roles in bolstering the strength of individual communities. I shall deal with some of their activities shortly.<br><br>
There are substantial efforts and resources currently being devoted to the development of rural Wales. Taking into account the activities of the various agencies, and the contribution towards training, housing provision and the roads programme, the Government's overall commitment is already running at over £300 million per annum. However, the time has come for the Government to take a special initiative to establish with the people of Wales how we can improve on targeting this substantial sum of taxpayers money.<br><br>
We should not rest there, however. The time is right for fresh initiatives to give impetus to the work of all those involved with the future prosperity of rural Wales. I therefore announce today additional resources of £20 million, bringing spending in rural Wales to £ 1 million per day.<br><br>
First, I am arranging for a £15 million increase in current provision for rural programmes: an increase in the WDA's funding for local projects, which will increase from £20 million to £25 million the agency's annual budget devoted to rural matters; a new £1.1 million increase in funding for local authority projects by the Welsh Office; projects of regional and national importance support totalling £1.2 million for leisure and sports centre developments at Rhayader and Llandrindod Wells; an increase from £l million to £3 million in the reserve put aside for assisting districts on rural housing matters; and an increase of £6 million by Tai Cymru in its support for housing in rural Wales in 1991–92.<br><br>
Secondly, I have decided that a further £5 million should be set aside for the support of projects put forward by local authorities which are likely to be of most benefit to the development of rural communities. I shall invite all the relevant authorities to make applications under these arrangements within two
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
months from today's announcement. I intend to impose no restriction on the size and nature of the projects submitted but I hope that the views of local communities will be fully reflected in the choice of projects put forward and that, where appropriate, the authorities will work closely with the relevant agencies, including the DBRW, the WDA and the WTB in drawing up their proposals.<br><br>
Thirdly, the rapidly changing circumstances of the rural economy; increasing resources devoted to rural issues both by the Government and various agencies; and the emergence of new institutions, notably the training and enterprise councils and the newly-formed Countryside Council for Wales, require a fresh look at the strategies being followed by the various players and the way in which these interact. I shall therefore embark on a series of consultations with all interested parties to seek their views on the right way forward for rural Wales in the 1990s. In the light of those consultations, I propose to publish my objectives in the early summer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the package put forward by the Secretary of State. Does he accept that the transport infrastructure—especially roads—is critical to the development of rural Wales? The Welsh Office has in recent years concentrated on the M4 in the south and the A55 in the north. What can the Secretary of State tell us about acceleration of road schemes such as the A487 and the A470, which are vital to rural Wales and its economy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We intend to spend £175 million on link roads to the A55. Our overall record on roads is one of which the Government can be proud. Since 1979, more than C3,000million has been spent on Welsh roads—more than half of which was spent on local authority roads. More is being spent on Welsh roads than at any previous time. Expenditure on trunk roads is greater per head of population than in England and Scotland.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) is right to consider what will happen in future. I am happy to announce that over the next three years continued high expenditure on major routes is planned and will exceed £550 million, about 60 per cent. of which will directly benefit rural areas. We shall make more detailed announcements at the appropriate time.<br><br>
I referred to the contribution to rural development made by the Government and the agencies. I single out the Development Board for Rural Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the commitments that the Secretary of State has announced involve new money, they will be welcomed—it would be churlish to do otherwise. If the Government have adopted a new approach. why were local authorities cut, squeezed and vilified over the past 12 years? If it is a conversion, is it a genuine conversion?<br><br>
The bedrock of our rural economy is, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, agriculture. The Secretary of State will know from the representations that he has received from the farming unions, that the industry is worried about the inadequacy of slaughtering facilities. Only three out of 29 slaughterhouses in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0430">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Wales meet European standards. It is regrettable that the Secretary of State has refused to meet farming unions to discuss their proposals for upgrading Welsh slaughterhouses. He also refused to make money available for upgrading those facilities. Why does he not take a leaf out of the book of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland? There, 27 out of 33 slaughterhouses are up to European standards. Over the past five years, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made more than £4.5 million available to the industry. If the Secretary of State for Wales realises the importance of the industry in Wales, why does he not adopt that approach and ensure that there is investment in the Welsh livestock industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions must be short if all those who wish to speak are to make their contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The package that I have announced involves new money for rural areas. At the time of the announcement on the local government settlement, I said that I would provide a further £18 million for local authority capital programmes. On Monday, I announced part of that package, and another is contained in today's announcement because I decided to direct a substantial proportion of that money to rural areas. That is in addition to the other new money that I have announced today.<br><br>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) about the farming unions are surprising because I have enjoyed a good relationship with both farming unions. My diary shows that I am to meet the Farmers Union of Wales sometime this afternoon. They will no doubt raise the matter of abattoir provision.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have made it clear that no specific funds will be made available to enable slaughterhouses to meet the new standards. However, anyone with new development proposals can apply for assistance under the relevant industrial or European Community grants, but ultimately that will depend on the commercial judgment of the companies involved. I am sure that nothing will stop the farming unions from meeting me or raising these important issues with me and the Farmers Union of Wales will probably do so this afternoon.<br><br>
Agriculture in rural areas plays a dominant role in the economy. Agriculture now represents almost 2.5 per cent. of the gross domestic produce of all Wales and employs about 4.5 per cent. of the total labour force. In rural areas, those percentages are higher. We may be justifiably proud of our farmers' reputation as being among the most efficient in Europe, if not in the world.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caerphilly asked about measures to support the industry. I am acutely aware that the livestock sector gives cause for concern. This has been an extremely difficult marketing period for producers in Wales and those in the rest of the United Kingdom and throughout most of Europe. That is why the Government have taken several measures to help producers, including bringing forward the timing of the two advance payments of sheep annual premium. which provided a cash flow benefit of almost
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
£25 million into the industry in Wales. Secondly, the suckler cow premium was paid this year at the maximum allowed under Community legislation — £51.69—to producers in less-favoured areas. We also persuaded the European Community to bring into effect the special safety-net provisions in the beef regime. That means that about £270 million has been spent on beef intervention in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Earlier this month, the Government announced substantial across-the-board increases for the 1991 hill livestock compensatory allowance rates. Those increases will inject an extra £4.8 million into the industry in less-favoured areas, bringing Welsh HLCA expenditure to about £37 million in a full year. Furthermore, in 1991, sheepmeat producers in the less-favoured areas will also benefit from the ecu supplement on the sheep annual premium, which is worth about £14 million to Welsh producers. Those are substantial sums and clearly demonstrate our commitment to Welsh farmers, particularly those in the LFAs. The total agricultural support for the rural areas, excluding the costs of other market support mechanisms such as beef intervention, now amounts to £110 million per annum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why were the forms that farmers use to claim the sheep and beef premiums under the hill livestock compensatory scheme not available or dispatched from the Llandrindod Wells office until this month? Farmers should have received the forms in December so that they could have claimed and received payment in March. Can the Secretary of State guarantee that farmers will receive the money in March?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed on several occasions with the farming unions the reasons for the delay and the legal problems that arose in connection with the forms, but those have now been solved.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's key point was that payments should get through to Welsh farmers. We are doing everything possible to ensure that the money reaches farmers as soon as possible and I predict that by the end of next month we should have paid more than 70 per cent. of claims.<br><br>
Before the intervention, I was about to refer to the DBRW, which is responsible for the economic and social development in mid-Wales. The body was created in 1977 and operates in partnership through the private sector, local authorities and other agencies and my Department. The board must
<br><blockquote><p>"prepare, concert, promote and undertake measures for the economic and social development of the areas for which it is responsible."</p></blockquote>
A major part of the economic development of rural areas has been led by the DBRW because of its geographical coverage.<br><br>
Hon. Members will be aware that the Welsh Office, and especially my hon. Friend the Minister of State, has taken a great interest in the launch of the development board's recent document "Strategy for the 90s", which details investment plans for the next three years. Perhaps the most significant new element of its strategy is the shift of resources away from the more prosperous eastern side of the DBRW's territory, which enjoys great business confidence and success, to the more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0431">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
remote rural areas in the west, where special attention is needed. There is no doubt that the economy there is neither as diversified nor as strong, and there is a greater dependence on agricultural jobs, with one in four of the work force employed in that sector.<br><br>
The development board's approach is already having an effect. In 1990–91, some 60 per cent. of the new industrial units constructed will be on the western side of its territory. That will help with the difficulties that are associated with being on the periphery and of higher unemployment.<br><br>
The board's western initiative will continue as part of its special rural action programme, which covers increased marketing as well as land acquisition and site development. The development board will work with the local TECs where appropriate, offering enhanced business training and advice. Site acquisition and factory construction will be of little benefit to the rural communities unless there are good quality businesses to use the facilities, and businesses obviously need good quality staff. I am satisfied that there is a balanced programme. Hon. Members will be aware that such was the quality of the case put forward by the development board for its special rural action programme that I announced my intention during the debate on what is now the Development Board for Rural Wales Act 1991 to provide an additional £1 million in resources for it. By endeavouring to provide jobs locally, the programme will help sustain local communities and provide opportunities to young persons entering the job market, thus helping to prevent their migration away from their area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for saying that the Development Board for Rural Wales is moving west. I am delighted at the new initiative in Cardiganshire, and that new factories are being built. However, the present recession is deeply worrying. Does the Secretary of State honestly believe that he will be able to entice industrialists to use the new factories in west Wales? I hope that he will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great confidence in the ability of the DBRW and the WDA, about which I must also speak, to implement their active promotional and marketing approach to business. The medium-to-long-term prospects for rural Wales are as good as ever.<br><br>
The WDA is responsible for those parts of rural Wales that fall outside the DBRW's boundaries. It has an increasingly important role in promoting economic activity and maintains close contact with other interested parties in the development of programmes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Secretary of State will tell the Committee how industrialists can be expected to take up the splendid new initiatives that he has announced when the railways system in Wales is in such an abysmal state? That system shows signs of getting worse by the day. If the deterioration of the past two or three years continues, people will not be able to get to west Wales at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, nor the language in which it was phrased. I recognise that the communications infrastructure is vital to the development of rural Wales. Railways have an important role to play, as was

brought home to me during my recent visit to Holyhead and other parts of rural Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On transportation, did the Secretary of State go to Holyhead by train? If so, he might have discovered that the engine breaks down, as it did last Saturday when I was travelling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope shortly to go to Holyhead by train. I hope also that we shall see the dawn of a new era in rail transport to Holyhead. In the past few days I had the opportunity to meet the chairman of British Rail, Sir Robert Reid, with whom I shared my strong views that we need to and have the potential to react to a positive move from British Rail.<br><br>
The WDAs activities include low-interest loans, a rural property conversion grant designed to bring derelict buildings into productive use; the development of rural initiative and venture enterprise grant scheme, DRIVE, which aims to encourage private investment in rural areas: a marketing and advisory initiative in support of the Welsh food and craft industries and, finally, support for the establishment of community-based enterprise groups. Nearly £20 million has been provided this year in support of these and other measures in rural areas.<br><br>
We are fortunate that in rural Wales the majority of communities are within reach of a town of moderate size. One of the major planks of the DBRW's strategy is to promote activity and enterprise within those local towns to establish self-sustaining communities that can also act as a catalyst for growth in their surrounding areas. The board has identified six growth areas and 12 special towns as a focus for investment and to ensure the most effective use of resources.<br><br>
Similarly, at the beginning of last year the WDA launched its programme entitled "Rural Prosperity", identifying a range of new opportunities in support of the agency's core activities. Some 11 communities were identified for the preparation of regeneration schemes by means of a sophisticated process of collaboration between all aspects of the community, the voluntary sector, the private sector and the public sector.<br><br>
Rural enterprise groups had been established earlier by the agency in five other key communities in rural Wales with the objective of harnessing the skills and enthusiasm of the community with the resources of the public and private sector to stimulate economic and social development.<br><br>
The plans and strategies for these 16 communities have now been prepared. The agency's current plans involve investment of around £20 million a year in rural Wales through its core activities, and it has now decided to expand that programme. The combined resource and expertise of the DBRW and WDA provide a powerful instrument for change. Both have recognised that the key to successful regeneration programmes rests on partnership with the rural communities that they serve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his announcement and his reference to the importance of the DBRW and the WDA, which do excellent work. Does he not agree that the time has come for them to be more active in agricultural projects, because, as he acknowledged, in some parts of rural Wales up to 25 per cent. of the population is engaged

in agriculture? With regard to the intervention of the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), would it not be a good thing if they were more active in the building of abattoirs and increased grant support for abattoirs via the Welsh Office and European Community support?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respond positively to the hon. Gentleman by agreeing with his remarks on food promotion and the role of the WDA and the DBRW. In less than two years we shall face the challenge of the single market, which is a marvellous opportunity. An open market of over 300 million consumers gives great opportunities to all those in Wales who can provide quality products which match the wants of increasingly discerning consumers.<br><br>
In November 1990, I announced that a new body, Welsh Food Promotions Ltd, would be established by April this year. I am pleased to announce that Mr. Alun Evans of Tywyn Gwynedd has agreed to become its first chairman. He is widely known as a successful farmer and as chairman of the British wool marketing board and NFU Mutual Insurance.<br><br>
The overall aim of Welsh Food Promotions will be to develop an effective strategy to promote and market Welsh food. That will be done through a combination of its own efforts and through the co-ordination of the efforts of others.<br><br>
Tourism is one of our most important industries, employing some 95,000 people, or 9 per cent. of the Welsh labour force, and helps to generate £1.5 billion of earnings. Wales tourist board has targeted resources on rural promotion and has contributed £1.6 million to the development of tourism projects in rural Wales. I recognise that I am taking a little while, but I must cover all the key areas of rural Wales.<br><br>
I must mention training and the development of enterprise because they will be vital for the future economy of rural areas. The establishment of TECs will ensure that the needs of local communities are addressed when strategies are devised to improve our training systems. I have been tremendously impressed with the response from employers in Wales to the TEC initiative. There are six TECs in operation, and with Powys TEC aiming to open on 2 April we shall have—in advance of the rest of the United Kingdom—a complete operational network established well in advance of our original plans. The TECs will galvanise the commitment of employers and free the creativity of local people by providing the training programmes they want, rather than those designed in Cardiff or Whitehall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to the Wales tourist board, which plays a major role in our economy. What are the latest developments in advertising for selling Wales to other parts of the world? Until now the Wales tourist board has not been able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know the marketing plans of the British Tourist Authority. Rather than take up more time by referring again to tourism, may I leave it to my hon. Friend the Minister of State to respond in detail? The hon. Gentleman may wish to expand on his intervention, but I could not agree more about the marketing of Wales abroad. I was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
happy to participate in Japan in an effective marketing exercise of Wales with the chairman of the DBRW, the WDA and the Wales tourist board. It was helped by the tremendous contribution of the Welsh National Opera.<br><br>
Housing plays a major role in rural affairs, and it is a fundamental concern, especially to young people. For a number of years Housing for Wales has taken the lead in the provision of additional social housing. No less than 25 per cent. of its resources have consistently been invested in rural districts in Wales. This year, the planned investment will be £25.5 million, which, together with a significant input of private finance, is expected to produce about 750 additional units of accommodation. As a result of my announcement today, that high level of commitment will increase next year to £31.6 million, providing about 900 units. It is being spent in close co-operation with the local authorities on properly addressed schemes to meet local needs, both for rent and through Tai Cymru's rural shared ownership initiative for low-cost home ownership.<br><br>
I believe that I have covered most of the important areas of concern to people in rural Wales, but I must not finish without mentioning forestry. Woodland cover in Wales amounts to nearly 250,000 hectares—about 13 per cent. of our country. Production of timber for industry will soon reach the 1 million cubic metre per annum mark, and output is set to go on increasing well on into the next century. Much of that timber is processed in Wales, helping about 90 wood-using enterprises of varying size—ranging from the pulp and paper mill at Shotton, through large board mills, to small sawmills. In total, some 5,000 people in Wales depend on forestry for their livelihood.<br><br>
There is scope over the coming weeks to develop further the contribution which forestry makes to our environment and recreation. Following further consultation with the Forestry Commission, I shall be finalising some important new initiatives. Impetus will be given to greater community involvement in the development of the maturing forests in the south Wales valleys with the launch of a valleys forest initiative. The Forestry Commission manages bout 35,000 hectares of forests and woods in this part of Wales, and the closeness of those wooded areas to the valley towns and villages means that they are well placed for people to benefit from further recreational and environmental developments. I want the people of the valleys to feel that they have a personal stake in their local woodlands and to enjoy them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to get on.<br><br>
I also hope to announce shortly plans to designate some of the Commision's woodlands in various parts of Wales as woodland parks. They will be smaller versions of the Commission's well-known forest parks and will consist of woodlands which are already much used by local people for recreation, or which could be managed for that purpose. The Commission already has eight forest nature reserves in Wales, but more will be established, especially near communities where they can be "managed" by local conservation groups and school children.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish my speech first.<br><br>
Imaginative initiatives of that kind will help to improve the understanding and mutual trust between forestry and environmental interests, and they have my full support.</span></p>
<p>Several hon. Members rose—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen now trying to intervene will be seeking to catch your eye later, Mr. Hughes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The farm woodland scheme is coming to the end of its initial three-year period and is due for review. Will he announce today whether the scheme will continue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be making an announcement in due course after further consultation. Incidentally, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) could learn something from his hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) about the techniques of intervention.<br><br>
At the start of my speech I spoke of the traditional difficulties faced by rural areas—loss of jobs and migration. I believe that our policies have restored confidence and helped to reverse that trend. Already in many rural parts we are seeing an increase in population and jobs being created or safeguarded. Enterprise is beginning to flourish with our encouragement. I am determined to build on this success and believe that the rural initiative will put new heart into rural Wales.</span></p>
<p>11.13 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. Hughes. Indeed, I welcome you back, as long standing right hon. and hon. Members will remember your astute, firm and courteous chairmanship on previous Committees. We have the utmost confidence in you and look forward to our debate under your chairmanship. However, as the Secretary of State and other members of the Committee have said, how sad are the circumstances which find you in the Chair.<br><br>
We all remember Donald Coleman with a great deal of affection and admiration. I am pleased that his family has the happy memory of the lovely church in Neath filled with 1,000 people on a glorious day when Donald Coleman's constituents from his valleys and his town paid tribute to him. As the Secretary of State also said, there was a large all-party turn-out at yesterday's memorial service in the Crypt for Donald Coleman. Everyone who spoke about him spoke with sincerity. It was clear that we had lost a treasured colleague.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has made an important statement and I wish to study the small print. I noted his praise for and emphasis on the Welsh Development Agency and Development Board for Rural Wales. Those bodies were legislated into being by a Labour Government and were sometimes opposed by the Conservative party, which was then in opposition. I am proud of the success of those agencies and of instances of interventionism. They have proved to be valuable to the economy of rural and urban Wales.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
The Secretary of State's statement was substantial. I acknowledge the importance of his remarks about a training initiative in rural Wales. The new moneys are certainly good news, and better late than never. Members of the Committee have been largely successful in urging the Government to provide money to help development in rural Wales.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman announced that consultations will take place and I wish them well. I can hear general election bells ringing in the not too distant future.<br><br>
A concerted policy programme is needed to sustain an enhanced life in rural Wales. The successful implementation of a rural strategy for Wales requires a rounded view of the social and economic needs of mid-Wales. The study of economic issues must include, housing, transport and education needs. I put it to the Secretary of State and his able civil service team that any policy programme should recognise that the retention of young people requires the expansion of employment opportunities and a corresponding growth in housing choice, recreation opportunities and provision of local services.<br><br>
When the Secretary of State spoke about agriculture he brought a genuine whiff of the farmyard to the Committee. I praise the remarkable success of our farmers, who meet every challenge in Wales. The climate, the terrain, the economy and the world competition pose enormous problems. Our people battle on despite mad cow disease, Chernobyl, salmonella, listeria and even anthrax and we should be proud of them.<br><br>
We congratulate you, Mr. Hughes, on your championing of the Badgers Bill. Everyone wishes the Bill all the best in its remaining stages. We are grateful for the way in which you introduced the Bill. Badgers need a champion and you have got what it takes, Mr. Hughes, to put the Bill on the statute book.<br><br>
The working farmer works all of God's hours, and so does his heroic wife. The family farms of Wales are of prime importance. This debate must be about their future. I have been informed that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is considering the transfer of the veterinary investigation centre from Bangor to Aberystwyth. The director of the centre informs me that his staff investigates infection in farm animals. He cites infection with deadly anthrax of a pig herd in my constituency. He gives instances of his work on salmonella in milk and eggs. He tells me that his office monitors proceedings and advises me that to move to Aberystwyth would hamper communications and co-operation with the north Wales medical and veterinary authorities. I urge the Secretary of State not to permit the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to go too far.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have talked about abattoirs in Wales. Only three are of the required European standard. The Secretary of State's answers to those interventions were unsatisfactory. Bearing in mind the need to develop overseas markets, what plans are there to improve and replace abattoir and processing plants? The Secretary of State mentioned the important Welsh Food Promotions initiative, and no one will cavil at the quality of the person he has selected. Will the executives be well paid? Will the best people be

encouraged to apply for positions? I want the initiative to be backed by high-quality staffing. Until the Government can say that the enterprise will be backed financially, there is no guarantee.<br><br>
When they raised issues on agriculture during Welsh questions in the Chamber, the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells) used the word "crisis" and my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) referred to bankruptcy. In response, I thought that the Secretary of State was aggressive, but not persuasive. He was on the defensive. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North is respected when it comes to agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What did the hon. Gentleman say?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Respectable, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will probably be on the record. In that debate the hon. Gentleman referred to "a bleak future" for the industry, a crushing loss of confidence and farmers' debt. I attended the National Farmers Union conference in Kensington last week. Several Opposition Members, some of whom are here today, formed a caucus with 25 to 30 delegates from Wales. The delegates were worried; indeed, they were more than worried. They are hard-working and honourable and it was disturbing to learn of their anxieties.<br><br>
The NFU press release of 12 February—it publishes many—entitled "Helpline for Farmers in Financial Difficulties" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A telephone helpline has been set up at NFU HQ in London for farmers who are in financial difficulties and wish to take independent advice."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"In addition to this service, the NFU is…is launching a new debt recovery service for farmers—to enable those who find themselves owed large sums of money by companies in financial difficulties to recover as much as possible as quickly as possible, and at the least cost to themselves."</p></blockquote>
Nobody will gainsay the verisimilitude of the report that I have given. The fact that the press release has been issued by an important union in the farming industry underlines the severity of the problems facing farming in Wales today.<br><br>
I wish to dwell further on Welsh farming. Aggregate farm income data for Wales showed a fall of 23 per cent. from 1989. In two years, total farming income has fallen by 41 per cent. That reflects a worse scenario for Wales than for the United Kingdom as a whole because of the Welsh industry's dependence on the livestock sector.<br><br>
Farm business survey results for the year ending February 1990 show that dairy and livestock incomes in Wales fell by an average of 22 per cent. to £12,277. That figure masks a range of circumstances. On hill and upland livestock farms, incomes fell by 37 per cent. down to £8,805. Taking out net interest charges, they have only £5,000 for management and investment. That is a serious situation.<br><br>
The Welsh farming industry has enormous indebtedness to London clearing banks, which rises and rises. It is now £600 million. In 1980, it was £222 million. We really are dealing with a crisis. Small wonder that the head of Barclays—the largest of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
the clearing banks—regularly admits in the public media that we are heading towards a crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures provided by the hon. Gentleman are right, but does he agree that even those stark statistics mask the reality that Members who represent rural constituencies see in their surgeries? Small farmers attend and show us their accounts. With net incomes of £2,000 or £3,000 per year, they cannot survive. They face the problem of having to increase borrowing from the clearing banks and other financial institutions. More importantly, they meet with a marked reluctance on the part of banks and financial institutions to support their loans much longer. The banks are pulling the rug from under the small farmers. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what the Labour party would do about that problem if it formed a Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that banks are putting pressure on individuals in the farming industry. The hon. and learned Gentleman is right, and his hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North was also right to refer to "a bleak future", a "crushing loss of confidence" and "farmers' debt".<br><br>
Mr. Peter Midmore is based at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and is a man of some standing. In a report commissioned by one of our county councils, he predicted that over the next decade, 12,000 employment opportunities will be lost to Wales. If associated off-farm employment is included, he predicts a loss of 24,000 jobs. I cannot guarantee that that distinguished academic will be right, but it is alarming even if it is only half right. What is the status of his report in the Welsh Office? Has it been considered in detail? If so, are any initiatives proposed?<br><br>
Interest costs consume farmers' earnings. He or she is stretched frighteningly. If the family farm goes to the wall and small farmers are bankrupted and not given assistance, the effects will spread beyond the confines of the farms involved. The post office, the garage, the carriers, the grocer, the school, the church and the chapel will all be affected by farm failures. We are dealing with whole communities and pressures on a way of life, a culture, a language and a landscape. Ministers must reply because they carry heavy responsibilities—they have been in office for 12 years. In that time they have had North sea oil revenues of £100 billion available to them.<br><br>
There is anxiety that the Government's proposals for reform of agricultural tenancies follow the concept of the Country Landowners Association of freedom of contract between landlord and tenant. It is argued that that approach would create more agricultural tenancies as the primary terms of tenancies would, in practice, be set by the landlord. Security of tenure, whether lifetime, or with or without succession, has been, and probably will remain, the major issue in the landlord-tenant debate. It is feared that, in a landlords market, young farmers eager to start farming on their own, will accept short-term tenancies and will eventually be dispossessed of their homes and livelihoods. I hope that that will not happen. When the Government give more details, their comments will be closely scrutinised.<br><br>
The Secretary of State referred to rural housing. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Labour party believes that positive measures must be taken to meet the housing needs of local people in rural Wales. We unreservedly condemn the arson attacks that have been associated with the campaign against second homes in north Wales. The issue is not primarily the individual's right to own a second home but access to a first home for people in rural communities. We need a supply of good quality homes priced within the means of local people. To that end, action must be taken to make the housing market in some parts of rural Wales more responsive to the economic circumstances of people living in those communities.<br><br>
Local councils need new powers. We have proposed to give local authorities new planning powers. Authorities could decide whether planning permission, in the form of change of use consent, would be required before a house could be turned into a second home. Authorities would be able to designate public action zones in which local authorities or housing associations could build affordable homes for rent. Such measures would help prevent local people from being priced out of the housing market and stop Welsh villages becoming ghost towns for most of the year.<br><br>
The Milk Marketing Board has served consumers and farmers well for almost 60 years. We intend to retain its basic structure, although a review is needed to take account of the different patterns of milk production and consumption. Moreover, a Labour Government would produce a major White Paper setting out what the nation expects of its farmers.<br><br>
The farmers of Wales should be congratulated. Much is asked of them and they are beset by difficulties. We should acknowledge that they have made the landscape and that they keep it at its most beautiful. We are all proud of the lovely land of Wales, and we should be proud of our farmers' contribution to it.</span></p>
<p>11.35 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must all feel much sympathy for the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). To misquote Dryden, he is unwilling to wound yet obliged to strike. It is greatly to his credit that today he allowed his unwillingness to prevail over his obligation.<br><br>
Let there be no mistake; this is a red-letter day for Wales. The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is important and very welcome. It is very much to his credit that he has been able to extract such a package from the Treasury. Those of us who welcomed his appointment but doubted that he could wield the clout of his predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), have been shown that our doubts were misplaced. He has proved to be a doughty champion for Wales in the Cabinet. The package that he has produced is long and complicated. I shall need more time to study it, but it seems to contain nothing but goodies. Above all, it shows that my right hon. Friend has not been afraid to make maximum use of the instruments to hand—the Wales tourist board, the Welsh Development Agency and so on—and he has done so with skill and discernment.<br><br>
I am glad that the title of today's debate emphasises
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
rural affairs rather than agriculture. Important as agriculture is to the Welsh economy, and no part of the United Kingdom is more dependent on it, it must be seen in the wider context of rural policy. Parliament often displays great confusion when agricultural policy is discussed, but there was no confusion in my right hon. Friend's speech. However, while I have high regard for and a warm personal friendship with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, he sometimes seems to be less than clear about what our objectives are. Do we want more production? If so, do we want people to grow basically pointless crops such as oilseed rape, or should we aim to keep such production within bounds? The Government have encouraged a hugh growth in the production of sheep, but we now find that there is excess supply.<br><br>
Is it our intention to maintain farm incomes? The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside noted that they have suffered a catastrophic fall, but it sometimes strikes me that we too glibly attribute that fall to high interest rates. They are not the sole or even the main cause of farmers' problems, as not every farm is being clobbered through being heavily over-borrowed. I suspect that the problem is more complicated.<br><br>
Are we talking about safeguarding jobs? We must bear in mind that when we talk about jobs in farming we are talking about families. Very few paid employees work on Welsh farms. Or are we talking about the environment? If so, should we not think more about directing support to subsidising those who maintain the countryside, especially in the upland areas, and rather less about maintaining high prices for production? Are we thinking as hard as we should about the introduction of quotas in sectors other than dairy farming?<br><br>
We all remember the howl that went up when quotas were first introduced into the dairy industry, yet our farming constituents are now begging us to retain and. indeed, expand the system.<br><br>
How do we best attain our objectives? Is it by repatriating agricultural policy, which the anti-Europeans would have us do, as though we lived in total isolation? Is it by fighting our corner in the EEC'? If so, is that best done by Agriculture Ministers, deadlocked night after night in fruitless negotiations'? Is this not an issue on which the European Commission should take the lead'? Yet when it does, the one thing that seems to unite Ministers of Agriculture is denouncing the proposals made by Commissioner MacSharry. Although I hold no particular brief for those proposals, that is a more hopeful approach than expecting Ministers to hammer out an agreed policy, which they have so far failed dismally to do.<br><br>
As I have said, I am glad that this is a debate on rural affairs rather than agriculture. The environment is an issue that transcends national frontiers, but it also involves many parish-pump matters. I should like to touch briefly on a few such matters that have arisen in my constituency. In the village of Dyserth, quality of life is being severely reduced because of the closure of the only bank and because of Clwyd county council's announcement that it is unable to provide library facilities. I am sure that that said tale must be repeated all over Wales. The village is having the life drained
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0436">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
out of it, with people turning to the nearer large town of Rhyl.<br><br>
The delightful village of Betws-yn-Rhos, one of the most truly rural areas in my constituency, has a very different complaint. The village has seen its character change over recent years due to a rash of house building carried out as a result of a successful appeal to the Welsh Office as opposed to a refusal of planning permission by the local authority.<br><br>
I understand, in the light of recent conversations with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, that the refusal was recommended by the planning officer, upheld by Clwyd county council, but reversed on appeal by the Welsh Office. I understand the economic need for executive housing in the area, but it has transformed for the worse the character of what was once a delightful village.<br><br>
On training, I recognise the great improvements being made by setting up TECs. However, a few, perhaps ailing, babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. A unit in Rhyl set up by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders provides training for people with special needs, such as ex-drug addicts and those with minor criminal records. The unit faces closure because the north-Wales TEC is ceasing to use NACRO as a training agent. That is very sad. The unit has provided valuable training for people who may not be able to make a major contribution to the economy, but who none the less merit special consideration.<br><br>
Withdrawal of such facilities will have adverse social consequences. That can be related to rural matters because the training unit had an effective outstation near St. Asaph where people were trained in horticulture. My wife and I visited it recently and were very impressed.<br><br>
These may be small issues, but they add up to a picture of a countryside that badly needs the sort of stimulation and encouragement that my right hon. Friend so notably brought to our affairs this morning.</span></p>
<p>11.44 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John P. Smith: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add to the compliments that have been paid to you today, Mr. Hughes, not least because you have called me so early in the debate. I am grateful for that because the subject is important. I am sure that you will do a splendid job, Mr. Hughes. The circumstances under which you have become Chairman are tragic, and as one of the newer Members in the Welsh Grand Committee and of the House I should like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Donald Coleman, who was a son of Barry and will be greatly missed. He was certainly very helpful to me as a new Member.<br><br>
I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on rural Wales, which is a prestigious subject for this important Committee. I want to draw hon. Members attention to the problems affecting rural areas that have not yet been mentioned. Other hon. Members may not refer to them, because they are not common to the rural picture, although they present real difficulties.<br><br>
The problems have also been suffered in the south and south-east of England. They arise from the pressures placed on agriculture and farming not from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
the underdevelopment and depopulation that is such a threat to mid and north Wales, but from migration into areas and the threat to our countryside that is posed by overdevelopment. We have that problem in the Vale of Glamorgan and members of the Committee should be aware of it, because it may be their problem tomorrow. We all hope that the present recession will soon end and that we can look forward to growth in the Welsh economy.<br><br>
We must then ask ourselves what that growth should be. Do we want a balanced growth that takes advantage of new investment and the jobs, wealth and prosperity that that brings at the expense of our beautiful countryside and environment? We need to decide now in preparation for that development.<br><br>
To give an idea of the problems, I shall tell the Committee what has been happening in my area. Traditionally, the Vale of Glamorgan is a relatively prosperous agricultural area with large family arable, dairy and specialist livestock farms, rather than the smallholdings and small farms and less productive hill farms with which we are familiar in the Welsh landscape. The Vale of Glamorgan is a rich and fertile area with a temperate climate. We boast the only vineyard in Wales that grows its own grapes and bottles its wine. It is a delightful wine, Mr. Hughes, and it is called Cariad. The time has come for the House to offer that wine in its Dining Rooms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman is on the important subject of Welsh wine, does he recognise that there is competition from the excellent vineyard at Llysfaen, under the label Panteg?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to do that. I hope that the House will have a selection of Welsh wines on offer.<br><br>
Even though the Vale of Glamorgan has such a prosperous tradition, no one should be mistaken that farmers in my constituency—it is in south-east Wales in postal terms, although four fifths of it is rural—have suffered great difficulties over the past few years because of a disastrous combination of factors.<br><br>
Tradition has it that farmers always complain, but those in medium and large farms regularly come to my surgeries because they are at the end of their tether. They are having to borrow against the value of their land.<br><br>
They are permanently walking a tightrope, which they fear that they could slip off at any moment. There has been the crises caused by the egg scandal; bovine spongiform encephalopathy; and the effect in Wales of Chernobyl. One problem after another has undermined livestock farming in Wales, and in my area in particular.<br><br>
Now, there is the dual problem of high borrowing costs and the threat of cheap imports from eastern Europe and Ireland, with the collapse of the middle eastern market. Farmers face grave financial difficulties and they are looking for ways out. Understandably—and I do not condemn them for it—farmers are seeking to set aside some of their land or to leave the land altogether and sell it and their farmhouses.<br><br>
That is where the developers come in. They sit as predators on the outside, waiting for any opportunity to acquire greenfield sites in open countryside to develop. There are currently plans for six golf courses,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0437">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
four 200-plus-bedroom hotels, three new settlements—which is a euphemism for something which worries me greatly—and a horse race track.<br><br>
I understand those hon. Members who might wonder what all the fuss is about, and who would love that sort of investment in some of the less prosperous areas of Wales, such as in the valleys' communities. Frankly, we have had all the development of that sort that we want. We do not want any more in the Vale of Glamorgan. That is not because we are anti-development; we are not. During the past two years we have enjoyed considerable inward investment in my area, indeed, the highest concentration of inward investment in western Europe, I believe. I refer to Bosch and the big expansion at Ford. I mention on my area because I am worried about the strains and pressures on the communities there. There is also the prospect of the major British Airways investment. They are investments that we all welcome and which bring prosperity and jobs. However, we must meet the challenges that they bring. I do not mean the training challenge, but the impact of our environment and the threat, if we are not careful, to our rural life and community.<br><br>
There is a very old rural tradition in the Vale of Glamorgan. The ancient market town and borough of Cowbridge is 800 or 900 years old. We want to keep such rural communities intact. We can live happily with our industrial neighbours and with that investment as long as the infrastructure allows us to do so. We are suffering from congestion on our roads created by extra traffic.<br><br>
We are not prepared to live with the overdevelopment that the predators want to introduce into that beautiful area, and which will reduce the quality of life for the people who live there. It will affect not only those who live in the rural Vale of Glamorgan, but the urban dwellers in Barry and in other town in the Vale of Glamorgan and throughout south Wales. The beautiful rolling hills and green meadows of the Vale of Glamorgan are part of the natural heritage of south Wales.<br><br>
For us to lose that would be a tragedy not just for this generation, but for future generations. We do not want the Vale of Glamorgan to be covered in tarmac, which some would like to happen. We do not want a second Sun city in the United Kingdom with golf courses, hotels and tennis courts. The beautiful countryside is an asset to everybody; it is an economic asset because of the tourist opportunities that it creates.<br><br>
The county council suggests amendments to their structure plan to introduce a policy creating new settlements. That is a lovely term for those red blots on the landscape that can be seen on either side of the M4 or on either side of the railway track that runs from Paddington to Cardiff. New settlements are red-brick eyesores. They were a mistake in England, and through planning legislation the Government have started—somewhat belatedly—to do something about them. Let us not make the same mistake in Wales. Let us stop them being built.<br><br>
Expansion of the population from migration into the Vale of Glamorgan is the reason given for the new settlements. They are intended to meet general housing demand and the demand of new business executives coming into the area. The county recently
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
produced a survey showing that business executives prefer to live in the Vale of Glamorgan, but there was no need to carry out a survey to discover that. Anyone who lives in the area knows that it is popular not only for business executives but for civil servants from Whitehall who are based at the Welsh Office or the Royal Mint or at other public service offices. They come to live in Cowbridge, which is a beautiful rural area. It is described as the filing cabinet of England because it is so popular with civil servants. The Vale of Glamorgan is already popular with executives and, perhaps, investors. We do not want to destroy that popularity, but we shall do so if new red-brick settlements are built.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the reasons for the new settlements is that in 1986 the Welsh Office introduced circular 30/86, which gave executives preferential treatment in terms of planning in the community? The Department of the Environment never issued such a circular in England. Once again, the people in Wales were treated differently from the people in England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that, and I do not like the idea of Wales being treated differently.<br><br>
The proposal for new settlements in my area would be disastrous. There is already plenty of housing for executives. If we started to build more housing, executives would not want to live in the area. They do now because of the quality and nature of rural life. There might be an excuse for such a proposal, albeit modified in another area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A moment ago the hon. Gentleman criticised South Glamorgan council for facilitating new settlements. That tier of local authority is not the most appropriate one to deal with the matter. A council is not a planning authority or a housing authority. Are not councils such as the Vale of Glamorgan district council far more sympathetic to what is happening in constituencies such as the hon. Gentleman's?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, although my understanding is that county councils are planning authorities. I shall refer to the matter in my closing remarks. Planning is needed to prevent the problem from developing. The county council says that the reason for the new settlements in the open countryside of the Vale of Glamorgan is to meet local housing need. That is absolute nonsense. The acute housing shortage in the rural Vale of Glamorgan will not be solved by building new towns and settlements away from villages, where people want to have the choice to live. We need pockets of purpose-built accommodation so that the children of people living in rural communities can afford to stay there and bring up their families, and elderly people can retire to sheltered accommodation and, perhaps, release houses for young families.<br><br>
Rural communities have the pressure of a dual community co-existing side by side—an indigenous village population together with a transient population that comes into the area, buys the housing, often does not stay for long and then moves away. Even if such people, or some members of their family, wanted to remain in the area, they could not do so because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
housing would be far too expensive. The proposals for new settlements will not meet our objective, which is pockets of housing to maintain the continuity of rural community life.<br><br>
The policies are ridiculous and nonsensical—I choose my words carefully—and they will fail to achieve their aims. Indeed, they will destroy some of the present benefits. The most damning objection is that new settlements in the open countryside, which will destroy rural life, will also detract from urban regeneration, development and investment in our waterfronts and derelict docklands. We would bend over backwards to attract the Parc Dyffryn Trust—which seems intent on destroying the beautiful countryside of Bonvilston and St. Nicholas—to our town, where there are more than 100 acres of derelict land.<br><br>
The Government are not prepared to take up the real development challenge. They want the easy way out and are destroying the environment for us, for our children and for our children's children. We should in no way support the proposals or allow them to be enforced. The problem exists today for the Vale of Glamorgan, but it could exist tomorrow for the constituencies of many other hon. Members.<br><br>
We must recognise the important role of farmers and we must help them out of their present economic difficulties. I believe that farmers now have the lowest income since the second world war.<br><br>
They also need recognition and reward for their role as protectors and managers of the countryside that we all love and appreciate. As the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) said, we must consider planning and the introduction of statutory green belts to protect natural assets, we must also question planning authorities giving themselves planning permission. We must consider instances of planning authorities being overturned on appeal by the Welsh Office and even the possibility of third-party representation during planning.<br><br>
We must concentrate on investing in roads and passenger rail services if we are to have more industrial development and job and wealth-creating development in my area—which we should welcome—otherwise we shall receive none of the benefits. I am a third-generation town dweller who, as a child, had the benefit of the countryside in the Vale of Glamorgan. I have many fond childhood memories, many of which involve tormenting farmers. I want my children and my children's children to have the same benefits.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join in the welcome to you as Chairman, Mr. Hughes, albeit in the sad circumstances referred to earlier. I applaud the decision to debate in this Grand Committee the important issue of rural affairs in Wales, and I warmly welcome the initiatives that the Secretary of State announced today. It is good that additional funding is to be put into rural Wales and that is is to be used not in one or two limited directions, but for several functions, public bodies and authorities.<br><br>
Many hon. Members want more to be done. The Secretary of State would wish to do more. It is noticeable that the initiatives have been announced at the end of February 1991, not far ahead, I suspect, of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
a general election. Nevertheless, the fact that there will be new leisure centres in Powys shows the people of Powys the value of having Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament who may have Conservative opponents who imagine, in the twilight hours, that they are breathing down our necks. That imagination is mistaken.<br><br>
The Government have at least announced some measures. It is more meaningful to present measures to the Committee than to promise a White Paper on agriculture, which would fall far short of providing clear proposals for the future of the industry. The Secretary of State rightly referred to rural communities in Wales. I assume that he intended his emphasis on the word "community". Perhaps we shall hear more in the Secretary of State's reply about the strengths of the community.<br><br>
The Minister and the Secretary of State know of my interest in village schools in Powys, especially in my constituency of Montgomeryshire. The impact of local funding on some village schools has been significant. There is a successful village school near the village of Llanymynech—part of which is in my constituency, and part in north Shropshire. The school provides a marvellous education, but is unable to arrange for redecoration because of the local funding system. There are dangerous structures in the school that are not being repaired. The only response to the governors from the local education authority is that under local funding, it is for the school governors to decide how to spend money. The school governors do not have money to spend on redecoration and repair of the electrical system. That defect in the local funding of schools must be dealt with soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have visited schools recently where I have been told that the schools have been able to carry out repairs under the local management of schools system that they were unable to carry out previously. In most cases in my experience, the local management of schools has been of advantage in carrying out repairs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how many of those schools were small village schools in Powys. I accept what the Minister said about the schools that he visited, but that is not the message that I received from small village schools in Montgomeryshire. I could give specific examples, if the Minister so wished.<br><br>
The Secretary of State used the phrase "cause for concern" about the agriculture industry. I was present at the annual general meeting of the National Farmers Union the other day and I heard the reactive speech of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Although I welcome the increases in subsidies in recent weeks, they have been reactive increases. We have to understand the difficulties that arise in negotiating changes in agricultural policy within the European Community. The attitude of the Council of Ministers towards the common agricultural policy is doing the Community—which I support—a great disservice because it is showing itself to be very inflexible and almost totally dominated by self-interest on a nation-by-nation basis.<br><br>
I hope that farmers who are facing a real financial crisis will not remain the prisoners of short-termism
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
for much longer, Any farmer who comes to a Member of Parliament in a constituency surgery for advice will find a fool if the Member of Parliament gives anything other than very restricted advice along the lines of "Keep your tractors and mend them. Don't invest in your farm by putting up new buildings. Don't borrow more money from the bank."<br><br>
It is not wrong for able farmers to develop their businesses; we give them that advice because we have no idea about the prospects for agriculture even in six months time. A new initiative on Welsh agriculture is needed that is based on agricultural and countryside management. We should begin to look outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The reading of newspapers in this Committee is forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carlile</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should be permitted to look outside the currently accepted norms of deficiency payments and subsidies. We should consider a system that would enable farmers to plan for the next 10 years. That system must be based on recognising that the countryside, which we all want to preserve and enhance, was not created by a bolt from the blue, but by those who farm the land. We should have a policy that seeks to exploit the ability of farmers to manage the countryside and the environment, and which recognises them as the contractors not only for the production of food, but for the maintenance of rural communities and the views and beauties of Wales. It is high time that we stopped looking at the next three, six or nine months and looked at the perspective of three, six or nine years.<br><br>
Part of a structured policy towards agriculture includes the point raised by the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) about abattoirs. I prefer to call them meat processing facilities, because they should be much more than places where animals are killed. Hamers of Llanidloes is one such example in my constituency. Abattoirs should be places where the animals are killed and the meat prepared into the form in which housewives wish to buy it, not only in Llanidloes or in Newton, but throughout Europe. I agree with the view expressed earlier that we should at least put Welsh agriculture on the same footing as agriculture in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Another aspect of policy that needs to be considered with a long-term future in mind is agricultural tenancy law, which affects Wales fundamentally. I have read with care and interest both the Secretary of State's letter to Welsh Members about the proposals and the consultative paper issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. As one might expect, they are strikingly similar. I am in the process of preparing a personal response, as I have taken a special interest in the subject and was the sponsor of the Agricultural Holdings (Amendment) Act 1990. Simply to put agricultural tenancies on a market that is a free-for-all is not a realistic way of developing an agricultural tenancy sector that will make the sort of contribution to Welsh agriculture that it should be making.<br><br>
I am sure that most of us want to see as many farms as possible owner occupied. However, for those entering the industry without a farm to inherit, there is an important need for tenancies that are available for a fixed time or until retirement, according to the merits
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
of the case. The basic flaw in the Government's proposals is that in a free market, as envisaged in the consultative paper and the Secretary of State's letter, there will be a grave inequality of bargaining position between the hard-nosed land agent—I do not use the term perjoratively, because it is the agent's job to do his best for his landlord—and the callow, unsophisticated young farmer who cannot afford the same quality land agents, accountants and solicitors as the landlord.<br><br>
I fear that in a free-for-all, bankruptcies and misery will ensue a few years hence because it will still be a seller's market. It will be very difficult to obtain tenancies except on unfair terms. If the provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 were applied to agricultural tenancy leases, that might be different. However, that would mean the Government breaking new ground, which would be strongly resisted by other Departments. I urge the Government to regard the consultation period as a genuine consultation period and to be prepared to reconsider agricultural tenancy law.<br><br>
I wish to join in the tributes that have been paid to the statutory agencies in Wales, especially the Development Board for Rural Wales, the chairman of which I am delighted to see in the Committee Room. Under imaginative guidance, the board is doing an excellent job. I hear with interest that it is moving west. Perhaps I can be forgiven for saying that I hope that for my constituents it will not be regarded as going west.<br><br>
I hope and feel sure that the development board will continue to invest in the whole of Montgomeryshire and keep a strategic eye on its industrial and economic policy. I should like to see the board more closely involved with the agriculture industry. I would be giving no secrets away if I said that I was probably knocking at an open door. I should like the Government to show a greater willingness to accept that.<br><br>
I should like the development board to overlap more successfully into tourism by giving it the right to build advance hotels, for example, if it judges it correct so to do. I believe that any such hotels would be let very quickly. It would be much easier to deal with the hotel shortage in Wales in that way than by waiting for private enterprise to propose schemes. I have seen so many proposals come to nothing over recent years that I have little confidence in the ability of private enterprise to put together hotel packages for mid Wales.<br><br>
Above all, I should like to see a much stronger transport infrastructure. That would enable the Development Board for Rural Wales, when it has created the opportunities for employment, to tell those who were taking up the factories and commercial premises that it was helping to provide them with a good transport system.<br><br>
I am afraid that what I said in my earlier intervention concerning the railway system is true. In what I think <i>The Spectator</i> calls "the chattering classes" of Wales, we no longer read Grimm's fairy tales to each other in front of our fireplaces on weekend evenings; we tell each other grim railway tales, of which there are many. Most of them so defy belief that they would be disbelieved if it was not known that they were true. I could tell the Committee about the lack of lavatories at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Welshpool station or about trains that never came or never went. It could keep us here for a morning of suspended belief.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State will make it clear to the management of British Rail that it is not doing its job properly and that it cannot expect bodies such as the Development Board for Rural Wales to succeed if it maintains such a miserable performance.<br><br>
I should also like to see the roads improved. We always hear about the A55 and its feeder roads and about the M4. I make no complaints that those developments have taken place. Perhaps I need do no more than remind the Secretary of State of a journey he took recently, in my company, by car from Shawbury aerodrome to Newtown. We followed behind vans, lorries and tractors and were unable to overtake, despite the brilliance of our driver. It was an object lesson in the wretchedness of our roads infrastructure. There are still many millions to be spent if rural mid Wales is to have a fair chance of competing with rural mid Shropshire or with rural mid Gloucestershire for the arrival of those companies that can guarantee the future of our communities.<br><br>
As I said at the beginning of my speech, I do not want to be churlish. I welcome the announcements that have been made, but there is more to be done. I hope that we can have debates such as this more often because rural Wales matters.</span></p>
<p>12.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to say how much I agree with nearly all of the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile). Even though the debate is about rural areas, I shall confine my comments to agriculture.<br><br>
I listened intently to the Secretary of State's introductory speech and, in common with other Members, I welcomed his announcements. I hope that we get good value for money for the extra £20 million to be invested. Towards the end of his remarks, I unsuccessfully tried to intervene on two occasions to ask about agriculture. There were earlier comments about the hill livestock compensatory allowances and about abattoirs, to which the Secretary of State indirectly referred. There is a crisis of confidence in agriculture. I had hoped that the Secretary of State would have devoted at least a part of his speech to the future of agriculture. As the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery said, the Secretary of State's one-off announcements are reactive to what is happening, rather than showing some vision, or planning for the future.<br><br>
There are great problems in agriculture. My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) referred to farm incomes, which fell by 23 per cent. last year and by 41 per cent. cumulatively in the past two years. We all represent rural seats and know of serious problems such as bankruptcies and of people in deep debt who are most worried about the future. That is the result of the fall in lamb and beef prices.<br><br>
Of more concern is what will happen in the next three, five or 10 years. Many farmers' sons and others thinking of an agricultural career, and even existing small farmers, wonder whether there is a future for them. They would like the Secretary of State to spell
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
out something about that future. Obviously, what most preoccupies the agriculture industry is the GAIT negotiations and the MacSharry proposals, which were not mentioned by the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), the shadow Secretary of State, ventured into those areas. The farmers' unions have conducted studies about that and Dyfed county council held a conference two weeks ago on the possible implications of the MacSharry proposals. The conclusion of a consultant from the University college of Wales, Aberystwyth was that during the next 10 years Dyfed alone could lose 400 farms, with a net loss of £31 million a year income to the local economy and the loss of 11,000 jobs. We are talking about a potential crisis as large as the coal industry suffered.<br><br>
The Farmers Union of Wales not surprisingly spoke in similar terms in a press release circularised to members. It said that one in four farmers face extinction. With that sort of future for farms, which form the backbone of rural life, I had hoped that the Secretary of State would have devoted at least a part of his speech to that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks of a serious problem for farmers. Will he comment on the fact that only a couple of years ago some of the training organisations in Wales were encouraged by the Minister of State to provide training for agriculture and horticulture? Within two years, those training agencies are being discouraged. One training agency that I chaired in Ogmore called Community Activities and Training in Ogwr—CATO—invested £100,000 in the purchase of a farm in the rural part of the Garw valley. I wish that the Minister had seen the development in the training of agriculturists—yet within two years it has been closed at a substantial loss. Will my hon. Friend also comment on the lack of encouragement for the training of farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that that echoes of the introduction of the milk quotas in 1983. Until their introduction, farmers were encouraged to expand production, then suddenly what was in quota before was no longer in quota. That shows the lack of planning and application. There is no long-term plan, just a vacuum. Farmers are filled with anxiety and despair.<br><br>
As for training schemes, as the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) said, anyone who now seeks our advice or seeks advice from the farmers' unions is told not to go into farming. It is like the coal mining industry. It is ugly; the industry may not be quite finished, but it is certainly contracting and dying. Its future looks bleak.<br><br>
Having described the prices, I have to admit that I agree with reform of the common agricultural policy and with the aims of the GATT negotiations. We must be flexible; the common agricultural policy needs dramatic reform. I, the Labour party and the British public have thought that for a decade or more. The CAP is absurd. It is a high food cost policy and it costs the Community £65 billion. That is £300 per consumer or £12 per week per family.<br><br>
I asked the Library to provide me with a comparison of the extent of subsidies in the European Community,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
the United States and other countries. The Library sent me a detailed document that dealt with producer subsidy equivalents—the total support for agriculture divided by the number of producers in agriculture. All countries subsidise agriculture. In the United States, 27 per cent. of the value of farm produce is subsidy. In Europe, 38 per cent. of farmers' incomes comes from the public purse.<br><br>
The steel and coal industries used to be subsidised, I met the Secretary of State earlier this week, as part of a deputation on coal mining in south Wales, to ask about the closure of collieries that are making modest losses. The Government's strategy in recent years has been to give no subsidies.<br><br>
If a pit becomes uneconomic, even for a few months, it is in line for closure. In agriculture, 38 per cent. of the value of produce comes from subsidies. That is ridiculous.<br><br>
The CAP creates mountains of surplus products that have to be dumped on world markets. That undermines the exports of the United States—part of the problem with GATT. More seriously, the CAP undermines the exports of the third world. The system damages the economies of the countries of the Caribbean, South America, Africa—those which can export—and Asia. The CAP is bad for world trade.<br><br>
The craziest facet of the policy is that it is production based. The greater the amount produced the larger the subsidy. A farmer with 1,000 sheep would receive 10 times more than a farmer with 100 sheep. A farmer with 500 milking cows would get 10 times as much support as a farmer with 50 milking cows. Price support disproportionately helps large farmers—80 per cent. goes to the richest 20 per cent. of farmers.<br><br>
The CAP is obscene because it is paid for by food prices, which disproportionately affect pensioners, families and the poorer members of our community who spend relatively more on food than other people. The CAP acts as a tax because it takes money from the poorest farmers and gives most of that money to the richest farmers, instead of spreading it out among all farmers. It is even worse than the poll tax. On many counts, the CAP must be dramatically reformed.<br><br>
I grew up in a rural area and have many friends and relatives who derive their livelihoods from agriculture, and I represent a rural constituency. Small farms must survive in any reform of the CAP. They must be the highest priority. In the past 40 years, there have been too many amalgamations—smallholdings are swallowed up by their neighbours when they come on the market. People have been driven out of farming. That has had an awful effect on the Welsh language.<br><br>
If we compare British farm sizes with those of Spain, France, Italy and our other partners in the European Community, we find that ours are much bigger. Amalgamation has gone too far in Britain, and the trend must be stopped. Looking to the next 10 or 20 years, I should like to see the existing farm structure preserved, both in my constituency and in rural Wales more widely. Holdings of 100 to 150 acres should survive to the end of the century for social and environmental reasons.<br><br>
Part of the attraction of Wales to tourists is its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
colourful landscape—its small farms, hedgerows and trees. A free-for-all agricultural policy would progressively destroy that, when far too much has been destroyed already. Welsh agriculture is also less intensive than in East Anglia, the midlands and other areas where there are large holdings. Welsh farms use relatively less pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and the like. Our food is of high quality for that reason. It is cleaner, purer and has less additives. That is why it is important to preserve small farms.<br><br>
I shall move on to the MacSharry proposals, which are the central item on the agenda within the European Community. The Government are hostile to the proposals. Broadly, MacSharry wants to preserve small farmers. There is no question that there will be cuts, but the broadest backs should carry the greatest burdens. As a socialist interested in the countryside and the environment, I have no doubt that MacSharry is right in his basic aim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that what MacSharry means by a small farm is defined in Community terms. He does not mean British or Welsh small farms. The hon. Gentleman will know that 90 per cent. of farmers in Portugal have 12 acres or less. In Italy, where there are not fewer than 2 million farmers, holdings average about 14 acres. MacSharry's modulated proposals are about micro-farms rather than small Welsh farms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that, but MacSharry talks about medium-sized as well as small farms. Few documents have been published about the negotiations. I have seen no details of the sizes of farms in individual countries. We should be bargaining in the European forum for our definition of small farms. I accept that the British definition is different from the Portuguese and the Italian, but we could devise national formulae for defining small farms in the negotiations. If that is not acceptable to the Community, perhaps we should decouple the CAP and devise an agricultural policy for each country according to its requirements. Under a suitable structure, policy should proceed on the basis that price cuts fall on the massive holdings of 1,000 acres plus. We must protect what we define as small farms—100 acres or less.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Livesey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a small family farm in Wales, though much bigger than in Portugal, is half the size of the average farm in England. Yet while it is possible to make a living from a relatively small farm in mainland Europe, it is impossible to make a living from an average family farm in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to justify the small farmers of Portugal, Italy and France with 10, 20, or 30 acres, but we must protect our small farms of 50, 100, or 150 acres. The farm structure in Wales is different from that in England. I do not want to argue along nationalist lines, but the backbone of Wales is quite different because of the structure of hill farms and such like.<br><br>
We know from last week's speech by the Minister of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food, and from his previous comments, that he is vigorously hostile to the MacSharry proposals. An article in yesterday's edition

of <i>The Guardian</i> states that
<br><blockquote><p>"most EC farm ministers, led by Britain's John Gummer. rejected out of hand the CAP reform plan…by Mr. MacSharry…Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark argued that the plans would hurt big, efficient farmers in northern Europe the most."</p></blockquote>
I support a policy that hits big farmers the most, but I object to those farmers being called "efficient". I said earlier that their subsidy is 38 per cent. of the value of their product. If they are so efficient, they should be able to live without the subsidy. Why do they need a 38 per cent. subsidy to bulldoze hedgerows and spray from the air with pesticides, nitrates and phosphates, which are so alien to the environment? It is absurd to describe such farmers as efficient.<br><br>
The MacSharry proposals would get rid of the subsidy for big farmers, but permit direct income aids for small farmers. When I read such comments on the proposals, I wonder about the Government's alternative. The National Farmers Union and the Farmers Union of Wales want to know with what the Government will replace MacSharry, but a vacuum exists there. We fear that most that the 30 per cent. cuts—or the 50 per cent. cuts agreed in GATT—will be spread across the board. Then, only large farms will have the reserves to survive and our small farms will be driven to the wall. That is the nightmare scenario.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman hear Oliver Walston, a rich and successful farmer, speak recently on the radio? He admitted that the subsidy to rich farmers must be phased out, but that the phasing out should be planned because if it were applied overnight he, and many others, would face ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. The Labour party and the MacSharry proposals do plan a phasing-out over about 10 years. I welcome the MacSharry proposals, which would protect small farms. I accept the reservations about definition and we must fight for our definition of small farms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and I hope to speak later in the debate. My hon. Friend makes a persuasive case for the MacSharry proposals. However, as he would be the first to admit, they do not represent Labour party policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have thought about these issues for the past 15 years. Before coming to the House of Commons, I was involved in environmental science and took a great interest in agriculture and the common agricultural policy. I am perhaps a couple of years ahead of the rest of the Labour party in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the MacSharry proposals are not appropriate for an hon. Member for a Dyfed constituency either. Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that they would bankrupt a farmer with 50 cows in Dyfed to keep solvent a farmer with 40 cows in the highlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on his intelligent search for that figure. I think that the Minister for Agriculture. Fisheries and Food gave me the same reply to a parliamentary question not long ago.<br><br>
On the question of whether the MacSharry
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
proposals would suit Wales, may I read an article from the <i>Western Mail</i> of 14 February? Its agriculture correspondent, Robin Reeves, welcomes the proposals, We know that the case for Wales differs from that for England.<br><br>
Mr. Reeves wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"But what is particularly alarming for rural Wales in general and Welsh farmers in particular is Mr. Gummer's rejection out of hand of the proposals put foreward by Mr. Ray MacSharry".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The man who is in effect Europe's Agriculture Minister has proposed that rather than simply slashing market support and allowing small and less well-placed farmers to be driven into bankruptcy, the heavier burden should be borne by the broader shoulders."</p></blockquote>
Mr. MacSharry recommends that
<br><blockquote><p>"small farmers with 200 acres or less should be shielded from these cutbacks by a two-tier support structure and direct income aids.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This approach has great virtues from a Welsh point of view. Wales is a land of small farms, producing food from often less-favoured land and maintaining the countryside.</p></blockquote>
It is Mr. Reeves view, not mine, that
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Gummer clearly speaks for England. But as matters stand, it is surely an Irishman in Brussels who speaks for Wales".</p></blockquote>
Farm sizes may be a problem—my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) has greater knowledge of the MacSharry proposals—and there are difficulties with definition. For example, our definition of small farms differs from Italy's and Germany's. We each have a national definition. Perhaps we should consider uncoupling the European CAP and introduce national versions of the MacSharry plan, allowing each nation state to devise its own draft for the coming difficult 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been speaking for 25 minutes. I assume that he will soon bring his speech to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes. The previous two interruptions prevented my finishing my speech.<br><br>
The MacSharry proposals deserve a welcome because the Government's alternative is a vacuum of the weakest to the wall and a quarter of farmers going out of business. The CAP needs to be refomed but it must be done in a way that protects small farmers. That is for linguistic reasons in my part of Wales, for environmental reasons, because their style of farming is much more environmentally friendly, and for food quality reasons because the food that they produce has fewer additives and is better.</span></p>
<p>12.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Ellis Thomas (Merionnydd Nant Conwy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes for adhering to the excellent tradition of calling two speakers from this Bench before lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams), who gave the Committee a seminar on the CAP. I shall speak in support of some of what he said a little later. The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) said that the Secretary of State brought the distinctive smell of the farmyard to our deliberations. I am aware less of the smell of the farmyard than of the noise of the election barnyard. It is plain from the statements that have been made today that everyone is waiting for a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0443">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
general election. Even though I have a great interest in the outcome of an election, I am able to remain dispassionate.<br><br>
I welcome the package of measures announced by the Secretary of State. The substantial increase in the Welsh Development Agency's rural development budget is especially welcome, as it follows the announcement of an increase for the Development Board for Rural Wales that was made during our deliberations on the Development Board for Rural Wales Act 1991. I also hope that local authorities will respond imaginatively to the Secretary of State's call for incoming projects. I am sure that the local authorities with which I am familiar in rural Wales will have projects on their books that they will be able to advance. I also very much appreciate the guidelines that he laid down about the need for community consultation. Sometimes that element is missing from projects that are put forward, yet it links directly with the activity on community enterprise to which the Welsh Development Agency gives special support through the community-based enterprise groups. We welcome that policy, as we have always believed that the Welsh economy has at least three sectors, among which the community-based, small-scale enterprise sector is very important, especially in connection with replacing lost employment in rural areas as well as in some urban and valley communities.<br><br>
I also welcome the announcement on rural housing, both in connection with local authorities and with Tai Cymru. The latter's work has been enhanced by the opening of its north Wales office in Llanrwst. The relationship between Tai Cymru and existing housing associations in rural Wales has been strengthened. I hope that there will be closer examination of more investment in the shared ownership scheme. When house prices were still rising in the rural areas, we believed that the problem of differential competition on the basis of income could best be tackled through shared ownership or shared equity schemes. I hope that many housing associations will examine such schemes closely.<br><br>
I also welcome the news that Alun Evans is to head the Welsh Food Promotion Agency. Alun is an old friend of mine and of all those who have been involved with Welsh agriculture. I am sure that he will devote himself to this endeavour with his usual tremendous energy.<br><br>
Especially welcome was the Secretary of State's announcement of his decision to institute a coherent countryside policy for Wales. It gives me great pleasure, in what might be my last speech in the Welsh Grand Committee, to greet that initiative, for which we have argued for many years. The countryside must be considered as a whole. The policies for agriculture, the environment, housing, social problems, education in rural schools and transport must be co-ordinated. The first great report on depopulation in mid-Wales was produced by Professor Arthur Beacham in 1964, but the history of industrial development in mid Wales, the pioneering work of Peter Garbett Edwards and the subsequent activities of Mid Wales Development, show that the agencies for a co-ordinated strategy have existed for a long time. However, they operate at different wavelengths and on different strategies, and do not always inter-relate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
The coming into existence of the Countryside Council for Wales provides us with the opportunity to develop a coherent strategy. I welcome the chairman and the broad membership of that council. I regret that the Labour party took such a negative attitude to it, but there may have been a change of heart. It would be helpful if hon. Members on the Labour Front Bench could spell our their view in case of an accident happening and Labour forming a Government. Opinion polls suggest that that is unlikely, but it is possible and we want to know whether the Labour party will maintain this important addition to our countryside policy in Wales.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Wales is, as Viscount Tonypandy used to say, the Minister for Agriculture and for Transport and for Education and for National Parks and for the Environment and for Tourism and for the Welsh Development Agency—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hunt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For Housing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and for Housing. The Welsh Office has the responsibility for adopting a coherent approach and bringing the diverse aspects of policy together. It has developed over the past 25 years into more of a policy-making Department. I should like the Welsh Office to be seen as an innovative Department in countryside policy. It should be more like the Northern Ireland Office which, because of its specific remit, appears more innovative. I shall not comment on the Scottish Office, which probably appears less innovative.<br><br>
I understand the reluctance of the Secretary of State to pronounce on planning because of his quasi-judicial role in determining planning appeals in individual cases. However, it is important to have a development planning strategy. I know that the Welsh Office is considering that, and strategic planning guidelines are being prepared. There was a recent conference on green belts, and the Secretary of State will respond to it within the policy cycle.<br><br>
Rural Wales has various designations—national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, country parks and so on. I welcome what the Secretary of State said about trying to integrate forestry into environmental planning. I had the pleasure of attending the opening of Coed y Brenin forest park, close to where I live in Dolgellau. That is an important designation for conservation and recreation purposes. Opening more woodland parks close to urban settlements will be popular. Before leaving the subject of forestry, will the Secretary of State explain the position of Coed Cymru? Will it gain more financial support in woodlands schemes promoted by the Welsh Office?<br><br>
We should consider the wide problems affecting Welsh agriculture. As members of the Committee have said, the agriculture industry forms the basis of the shape of the Welsh landscape and of the rural economy. We have emphasised the importance of creating alternative forms of enterprise in the countryside. Unless the agriculture industry has stability and long-term prospects, it will be very difficult to plan coherently for the future of the countryside.<br><br>
The work of Peter Midmore of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth has already been

mentioned in Committee. His predictions show how many lost opportunities for employment will take place if existing trends in agriculture continue. He projects 12,000 lost job opportunities, but more than 24,000 losses over the next 10 years when off-farm employment is brought into the projection. Were such losses to occur in other major industries, we would be talking about crisis and collapse—probably meaning
