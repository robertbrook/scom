	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i></p>
	<p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Welsh economy.</p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. At 3.30 pm, on the Floor of the House, Secretary of State for Employment made an important statement. That three-page statement is now available in the Vote Office. Are Ministers in this debate prepared to make a statement before the scheduled end of our debate on how help for the unemployed will be assigned to Wales? How much of the money mentioned in the statement will come to Wales? How many training places and how much help for how many unemployed people will Wales receive? Ministers should urgently seek to catch your eye, Mr. Hughes. I hope that you will be flexible and enable them to make known what the Secretary of State will make available for the unemployed in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Several hon. Members 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no facility for such statements in the Welsh Grand Committee, but provided that the Minister of State catches my eye later, he may refer in his concluding remarks to the statement made in the House this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hughes. Would it be possible for the Minister of State to say now that he is prepared to catch your eye?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a further point or order. The Minister of State has heard the hon. Gentleman's remarks and will take cognisance of them when he replies to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hughes. Several speeches made in the Grand Committee this morning issues that have arisen out of the statement made by the Secretary of State for Employment. Surely procedures should be flexible enough to allow the Minister of State or the Secretary of State—who, I regret, is absent—to say something before the wind up. The wind up takes about 10 minutes, and the Minister is supposed to answer the whole debate. He would not be able to give an adequate response to my hon. Friend's legitimate request. Many of us have raised issues that were partially, but not properly, dealt with in the statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for Ministers, not for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts (The Minister of State, Welsh Office)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hughes. The statement by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment was made specifically on behalf of England and Wales. I shall deal with it if I catch your eye, Mr. Hughes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that you have found it opportune to call me in my first Grand Committee. It reminds me of the statement made by the late Aneurin Bevan, the predecessor of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot). He described how he searched for power from the lowliest constituency party ward meeting right through to when he was a Member of Parliament and Cabinet member, but he was never able to find it. I now realise that he should have been searching for it in the Welsh Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am honoured to follow in Donald Coleman's footsteps. He was an extremely distinguished Member of Parliament, who not only represented Neath but was Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee. I am sure that you will follow in his footsteps, Mr. Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that I was on my feet in this Room was at about 1.30 am, in a Finance Bill debate. I was making a speech about the Conservative proposals to bail out Lloyd's names, among whom are 62 Members of Parliament, including the Secretary of State for Wales. The people of Wales are facing massive recession; unemployment is rising; businesses are closing; bankruptcy is increasing and poverty is apreading. I hope that they will not wake up one morning to find that the Government, including the Secretary of State for Wales, have bailed out Lloyd's names to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. That money should be spent on investing in the people of this country, rather than going to the rich and powerful who can rig the rules in their favour and put their hands in the public purse. I hope that that concern will be conveyed by the Minister of State to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the rest of the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard from the Secretary of State the familiar litany claiming that the recession has not hit Wales very hard. Indeed, he painted a picture quite unrecognisable to the people who live in Wales and are experiencing the effects of the recession. If there is any substance in the claim that Wales has done less badly than the rest of the United Kingdom, it is justified on only two grounds. First, the impact of the recession has been felt principally, at least in its early period, in the service sector of the economy, and Wales has a smaller proportion of service jobs compared with the south of England where the recession has bitten even deeper. Secondly, over the past 12 years, and exceptionally in the United Kingdom, Wales has practised half-hearted Keynesism, rather than pure Thatcherism or even Majorism. Every week we await with bated breath the definition of Majorism as a further rehearsal, rather than the final performance, takes place. I trust that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
when the Minister of State receives the definition of Majorism, he will have it translated into Welsh, although I am sure that the people of Wales will find that just as unpalatable as the English version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have experienced in the past 12 years, accelerating in the past year, is recession biting deeply, notwithstanding the excuses made by the Secretary of State this morning. The number of males in employment in Wales fell by 106,000 between 1979 and 1990, and there has been a further fall this past year. In its May 1991 survey, the Confederation of British Industry reported that employment in Wales had fallen sharply over the past quarter and was expected to continue to fall over the next few months, belying the rather rosy picture painted by the Secretary of State and his Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
South Wales and the coal industry are particularly affected. In Neath, in September there were an estimated 2,500 people employed in coal mining, whereas in September 1989 that figure had fallen to 600. Now, with the closure of Blaenant colliery last year, those jobs have disappeared almost completely, save in a few licensed mines. Will the Minister consider the serious question of the collapse of the coal industry and employment in the industry in south Wales during the Government's reign?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In March 1979, there were 26,400 wage earners on British Coal's colliery books in south Wales. That figure had fallen to 1,281 by 8 June 1991—an astonishing collapse. The claim that it has been offset by the growth of opencast mining does not bear scrutiny, as the number of employees on sites in Wales operated by British Coal fell from 1,940 in 1985–86 to 1,500 in 1989–90. That is a fall of 22.7 per cent., and it shows that the number of jobs available on opencast mining sites has declined while those available in deep mines have all but disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deliberate strategy of running down the deep mine industry while encouraging opencast mines, although it has not helped employment, has been paralleled by a ferocious rise in coal imports. In 1979, United Kingdom coal imports totalled 4.375 million tonnes, but by 1990 that figure had risen to 14.783 million tonnes. In 1979, coal imported into Welsh ports totalled 1.17 million tonnes, whereas the 1990 total of 3.59 million tonnes represented a staggering increase of 207 per cent. Employment has been encouraged almost everywhere else in the country at the same time as it has been run down deliberately in the south Wales coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wynn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Government deliberately run down the coal industry. How does he explain the fact that the Labour Government of 1964 and 1970 closed 50 pits, while the Labour Government of 1974 and 1979 closed 11 pits? The 80,000 plus people working in the south Wales coal mining industry in March 1964 had declined to 47,000 by March 1969. In the hon. Gentleman regards the policy of this Conservative Government as deliberate, how would he describe the policy of those earlier Labour Governments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is aware, the Govern
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
ment's policy is deliberate because there has been no investment in any new coal production. In contrast, the periods of office of the Labour Governments to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred were characterised by the new investment that was made. Had there been a Labour Government in the 1980s, the Margam super pit, for which new investment was considered, would probably have opened. I am surprised that the Minister denies that the policy has been deliberate, as Government spokesmen have exulted in the fact that deep mines have been closed all over the country, not just in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neath suffered the closure of the Blaenant colliery last year, with the loss of 518 jobs. That helped to ensure that the unemployment rate in Neath jumped in the 12 months from May 1990 by 731, according to official figures from the Department of Employment, or by 891 according to the Unemployment Unit, which estimates unemployment on the pre-1982 basis. That was before the Government's 30 changes to the method of calculating—or, rather, fiddling—the figures. The official figure shows an increase in unemployment in Neath in the past year of 41.6 per cent., while the Unemployment Unit figures show a 31.7 per cent rise. Both sets of calculations are absolutely staggering and reveal the true nature of the recession that is biting deep into my constituency, just as it is biting into the areas represented by all hon. Members in south Wales, regardless of whether they are Labour or Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have lost control of the economy and of the battle for full employment. That is why the Secretary of State for Employment produced a package of half-hearted measures this afternoon which, frankly, is chicken feed. It come nowhere near to measureing up to the scale of the problem that the Government are seeking—or pretending—to tackle. They are camouflaging, not solving, the problem by producing short-term gimmicks rather than long-term serious answers to the catastrophe that is gripping Wales and the United Kingdom as a whole. The recession is visible not only in direct employment terms, as revealed by the figures that I have quoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appologise for interrupting my hon. Friend in his maiden Welsh Grand Committee speech, but in addition to his allegations about this afternoon's statement, is it not also true that that statement does not remove the nonsense of limiting training opportunities to people who have been unemployed for long periods? We need pro-active, not reactive training. None of the conclusions in the statement change that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to be interrupted by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rymney (Mr. Rowlands), as he made the point far better than I could have. I hope that the Minister will discuss that point when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the wider picture of the recession. Business failures in Wales are accelerating dramatically. 346 business failures were recorded in Wales during the first quarter of 1991. That is an increase of 51.1 per cent over 1990. Bankruptcies, of which there were 221, rose by 61.3 per cent, and liquidations rose by 35.9 per cent. That is not a picture of a happy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
economy rosily rowing into the sunshine, as the Secretary of State wishes us to believe. It is a picture of an economy in desperate crisis. The Secretary of State should concede that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When does the Chancellor of the Exchequer intend to cut interest rates? The people of Wales want to know because we are suffering from desperately high interest rates. When do the Government expect to negotiate the position of the pound within the European exchange rate mechanism? The artificially high pound is having a dramatic impact on the ability of businesses to survive the recession and recover from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest survey conducted by the Welsh chambers or commerce and industry shows that the recession in Wales is deepening. While there is some confidence that in 12 months businesses may have turned the corner, the realities of the moment are serious. The chief executive of the Cardiff chamber of commerce and industry, Dr. David Philips, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the five quarterly surveys with which I have been concerned since I joined Cardiff Chamber, I have never seen such a mass of minus signs when comparing the current quarter with the previous quarter. This result regrettably confirms my suspicions expressed in January that Welsh industrial performance, having held up against the recession in October last, might eventually be fully indistinguishable from the rest of the UK. That has now happened."</p></blockquote>
That was said by someone speaking not from the comfort of Westminster, but from the reality of business experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney mentioned the problem of training in Wales. Despite what the Secretary of State said this morning and the minuscule measures announce by the Secretary of State for Employment—I nearly said "Unemployment"—this afternoon, training places and provision in the Neath area and west Wales have been cut time and again in the past year. For example, West Wales training and enterprise council reports that, measured in employment training weeks, the provision of employment training for the year 1990–91 was 208,500 training weeks. In 1991–92, just 165,300 training weeks will be provided, a fall of 43,200, or 21 per cent. That is not a sign of health training provision; it is evidence of training cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I shall quote last week's statement by the director of personnel of Dyfed county council about training places. He said that there were
	<br><blockquote><p>"not enough places for youngsters coming out of schools in the summer".</p></blockquote>
In Neath, and it is perhaps the most criminal cut of all, 38 training places for special needs trainees have been cut. Depsite the fact that the Secretary of State for Employment made a genuflection towards the need for extra special needs training in his statement in the House this afternoon, that will do nothing to meet the crisis faced by those with special needs in West Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general manager of the West Wales training and enterprise council told me in a letter that the reduction was a result of cuts in Government funding. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The total employment training provision in the West Wales areas has had to be reduced."</p></blockquote>
That is straight from the horse's mouth. The Minister cannot deny it when he replies. The Minister and his
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
colleague, the Secretary of State, would have painted a more credible picture of upturn out of the gloom of recession if it was not the second time around. We had a massive recession in the early 1980s. Now we are having another one which demonstrates the incredible incompetence and the abject failure of the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday, the monthly figures showed a further decline in manufacturing output across the United Kingdom and in Wales. We have the biggest public sector borrowing requirement since the early 1980s, which bodes ill for any Government funding of the proper provision of training and employment that south Wales desperately needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pound lost a pfennig against the deutschmark every day last week. The pound has slipped from fourth to seventh position in the ERM. That is a sign of the weakness of sterling and the failure of the Government's economic policies, which are predicated on a strong pound. The pound now stands at a 15-month low against the dollar in the midst of a massive balance of payments deficit, which will increase with any recovery from the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The story is one of incredible Government failure to address the severe problems that the people of south Wales have faced over the past 12 years. We must have a complete change in policy towards investment in training and employment. Market forces must not be allowed to operate unfettered and unrestrained as though they alone can deliver the employment prospects, the industrial efficiency targets and the strong economy that Wales deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a new partnership between Government and industry to provide a better future for the people of Wales. I am confident that that will happen after the general election under a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones (Ynys Món)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) on his maiden contribution to the proceedings of the Welsh Grand Committee. He represents an area that I know well because I spent the early part of my secondary education at Pontardawe grammar school. I wish the hon. Gentleman well in his endeavours on behalf of the people of his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) on his maiden contribution to the Welsh Grand Committee. I am sure that both he and the hon. Member for Neath have been baffled today by the decription of this august body as the premier body for debating Welsh affairs given by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones). He said that as if this Committee was a substitute for a Welsh parliament. I am sure that that rhetoric will have fooled no one who has followed our proceedings for the past four years while I have had the privilege of being in the House, or in previous years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

cent of the Welsh people would vote for a regional assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has forgotten that, since 1979, support for a Welsh assembly has risen steadily. Every opinion poll now shows that support for a Welsh Parliament is much higher than it was at any stage before 1979. The reason is obvious. We have been ruled for 11 years by a Conservative Government. There are several reasons why the people of Wales now have a different view from that which they had in 1979 on the establishment of a Welsh Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we do not forget that there have been exciting developments in the relationship between Europe and the Welsh economy. The members of Plaid Cymru are not parochial, insular or inward looking. We are outward looking. We want partnerships to develop between the Welsh economy and members of the European Community. We have heard today from the Secretary of State about some exciting developments between Wales and Baden Württemburg, which has a strong regional Government and its own assembly. The Secretary of State also told us about the relationship between Wales and Catalonia, which also has a regional government. Why should Wales be any different in the new Europe from those historic nations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern is clear. The Europe of tommorrow will involve the historic regions and nations of Europe, of which Wales will be an integral part. The rhetoric that we heard from the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), does Wales a great disservice. It is the nationalism of yesterday, a type of sovereignty that no longer exists except in the minds of narrow British nationalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a new pattern of politics. We want Wales to be part of a new Europe, which is not based on outmoded systems of sovereignty, but in which sovereignty is a shared concept between the historic nations and regions of Europe. The chasm which now divides the Conservative party is damaging the Welsh economy, and we are suffering from 11 years of Conservative rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is on the geographical periphery of Europe, but is must not be marginalised because of that peripheral location. Wales must retain its place at the heart of Europe. We have strong cultural links with other countries in Europe, and that is where our future lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State told us today, not very convincingly, that Wales has benefited in the past 11 years. We have seen great structural changes in the Welsh economy. It is true that there have been several inward investment projects. It would be churlish for any hon. Member to deny that. Indeed, there have been some important developments, particularly in north-east Wales and south-east Wales. I hope that projects will be developed in north-west Wales soon. But all those welcome initiatives must be put in the context of the loss of 40,000 jobs in the steel industry in the past 11
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
years, the loss of 5,000 agricultural jobs and 25,000 jobs in the coal industry. That is a massive blow to the Welsh economic base.

However good the inward investment projects, they cannot repair the damage that has been done to the Welsh economy. I appreciate that some of that damage is a result of structural changes, but much will have to be done to restore the Welsh economy to its position of 1978 and 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that more people are in work now than in 1979, although we have high unemployment figures. On the face of it, that is an attractive argument to put before the Committee. However, included in the figures of those in work are those on training schemes and those in part time work. Those training schemes and part time jobs cannot replace the quality of the jobs that have been lost in the past 11 years. Compared to the skills that have been built up through the generations in our Welsh communities, the level of skills required in the new jobs means that a very low skill base is now needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the new jobs are part time and for women who are retuning to work. Women would like to return to work at the same level of skills they had before they left employment to bring up their families. Because of the rudimentary child care facilities in Wales, those women cannot go back to work to develop the skills that they had when they left school or college. On behalf of the women of Wales, I make a plea for child care facilities to enable them to make a valuable contribution to the Welsh economy and so that they do not have to return to work below their skill levels. I hope that the Minister will respond to that important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current recession has been caused by massive economic blunders, fanned by high interest rates and low manufacturing output. It has had a devastating effect on jobs in Wales. In 1990 1,200 businesses crashed in Wales, the highest figure for 10 years. In the first quarter of this year, 100 businesses collapsed every month. In south Wales, in the first quarter of 1991, 163 companies went into liquidation. In the last three years, redundancies in the county of Dyfed have gone up threefold, they have almost doubled in Gwent, and they have risen by a factor of two and a half in Mid Glamorgan. Unemployment in Wales has risen by 25 per cent. in the year to March 1991, a higher rise than in Yorkshire, north-west England, north-east England and Scotland. Current predictions are that unemployment will continue to rise until it reaches at least 150,000 in Wales, before the recession bottoms out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people have been badly hit by the recession. I have talked to those involved in finding employment for young people. They tell me that this year is the most difficult for five years. Employers should be crying out for young people because of the demographic changes that mean that fewer and fewer young people are coming on to the job market, but young people are finding it difficult to gain employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response given to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) was that unemployment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
in Powys is low. But that hides much more. Depopulation is the hidden unemployment in rural Wales, but those figures are not recorded anywhere. It is important for the Minister to recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that we do not need an elected Parliament in Wales because we have a Secretary of State in the Cabinet. He is Wales's shield against the ravages of the recession. He can speak up for Wales in the Cabinet. We know that every Secretary of State for Wales does that. Some shield we have had in the past 10 years! It has been pierced often. I sometimes wonder whether it has any scrap value left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales needs to look forward to the next century. The people of Wales recognise increasingly that they want to be part of the new Europe of tomorrow. The Welsh economy will benefit from closer co-operation with our European partners. In the Community, they think nothing of regions being given financial assistance to develop their economies. But the very opposite has happened in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional assistance that the Government gives Wales in real terms—I shall not mislead the Committee by talking about cash terms—was £123.7 million in 1989–90, which is the last year for which figures are available. That compares with a figure of £290.3 million for 1978–79. So there has been a massive reduction in regional aid for Wales. That includes the money that has been provided to the Welsh Development Agency. With those figures, we need more than someone to speak up for us in the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have heard from other Opposition Members and, for the first time in my memory, from Conservative Members, who unfortunately are not present today, we need a Welsh parliament. If we could coalesce around that aim, we could put forward great ideas whereby Wales joined the future with confidence rather than looking to the past and the disasters of the last Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones (Clywd, South-West)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a misconception earlier this afternoon when my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) raised a point of order on the subject of the recession in Wales. The Secretary of State suggested that the House had decided that the Welsh economy was a far better subject for discussion in this Committee. That was the misconception. What actually happened was that the Table Office decided that the recession in Wales was too pejorative a subject. That is why we have a debate on the Welsh economy instead of on the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has turned out to be a debate on the recession because the Welsh economy is in recession. After nearly 12 years of economic mismanagement, the Government have brought the Welsh economy to its knees. The Tories are using the latest recession as a blunt instrument with which to reverse the effects of an unsustainable consumer spending boom that they induced. Their unimaginative policy crushes the life out of trade and industry by increasing the cost of borrowing and causing a slump in demand. They have no regard for those at the sharp end of such measures,
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
which mean closure after closure in the Welsh manufacturing sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past year, there has been a 159 per cent increase in Welsh business failures—that is, about 88 closures. Because of those closures, there has been a rise, not surprisingly, of almost a quarter. It is 24 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Employment's figures show that between June 1979 and April 1991, despite at least 30 attempts by the Conservative party to fiddle the figures—apart from one, all downwards—unemployment in Wales has increased by 64.8 per cent. That paints a very different picture from the rosy one put foward by the Secretary of State in his very selective statistics. The only increase was in the number of engineering jobs, which went up 500 per cent, but that probably means that they increased from 4 to 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Countless industries have been allowed to decline and disappear in Wales under the Conservative Government. From the start, there were cuts in British manufacturing investment, and that did not recover to 1979 levels until 1988. Figures for the fourth quarter of 1990 show that manufacturing investment has declined to the level of 12 years ago. In May, the CBI revealed that investment in buildings, plant and machinery was negative. Eighty per cent of the firms report that they are working below capacity, compared with 30 per cent two years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Tories again send Britain's economy lurching into deep recession, Welsh manufacturing and extractive industry is being decimated. In Clwyd, the Brymbo steeworks, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), were closed in September 1990. Many of my constituents were employed there. The day after steelmaking ended at Brymbo, Laura Ashley closed its plant near Mold. Between them those plants account for the loss of more than 1,400 jobs. The list of firms that have gone bust or lost jobs in the past six months in Clwyd is extensive. Last night, I made a non-chronological, inexhaustive list of the closures. Many were in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham, where many firms employ my constituents. In Wrexham, BICC lost 75 jobs in May. In March, CMB bottles and specialty closures lost 77 jobs. Cobalt UK training has lost several jobs, including training jobs, in the past few months. In February, JCB lost 71 jobs and in March G-Plan closed with the loss of 125 jobs. CP pharmaceuticals lost 30 jobs in January and Dairy Crest lost 38 last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, Mander Domolac lost 26 jobs in December. Brother Industries, one the Japanese investments that are supposed to hold on to their staff to the limit of possibility, lost 80 jobs in April. Ritz in Denbigh closed with the loss of 80 jobs. Other losses include 15 jobs at Lifeguard in Denbigh; 60 jobs at Biddulphs; 10 jobs at Cambrian Drinks of Ruthin; and 10 jobs at Kinder cars in Corwen. Jobs were also lost at Gwydelwern Sawmills. As I said in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), only last night Heaps of Nantwich announced the loss of 105 jobs with the closure of the plants at Johnstown in my constituency and elsewhere in Wales. Many of those who lost their jobs were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
women who were the sole wage earners in areas such as Rhos, Johnstown and Ponciau. My hon. Friends have mentioned many other job losses across Wales and I shall not list them again. That is the reality of the economic miracle—though even the Tories dare not use that prhase now—in Clwyd, South-West and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WDA has done much, as the Secretary of State said, that is commendable, but much more is needed. The WDA would do better at providing new jobs if the Government reinstated areas that qualify for regional grant status, which they removed as soon as they came into office. Such funding would be topped up by European Community money. That would increase funding where it was needed and assist central Government in their oft-stated aim of reducing public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WDA's intention of reducing directly-funded factory building while increasing partnership schemes with private developers fits in with Labour's vision of a supportive partnership between Government and industry, as exists in many successful competitor countries. That will be all well and good, provided that enough companies survive the current adverse economic climate created by the Government and remain in a fit state to enter into such partnerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have mentioned the problems of the rural economy. I shall not go into them in detail because we had a good debate on that this morning, which showed how badly the rural areas are suffering in the present economic climate. Farming in particular has been hit by huge interest rate rises and declining prices. As well as increased assistance for industrial areas, every opportunity should be taken to help to develop a viable and more diversified rural economy. More processing and slaughtering plants are needed for Welsh produce to regain the value lost to Wales when people are forced to export raw materials to seek those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increased backing must be given to agricultrual, environmental and rural education and training. A strong liaison is needed between the agricultural training board and the agricultural colleges. A high percentage of Welsh land is rightly classified as less favoured areas and farmers in such areas must continue to receive their livestock compensatory allowances. The limits already imposed on such grants should be removed. It is essential that hill livestock compensatory grants continue to be available if the numbers of young people leaving the countryside are not to increase. As the hon. Member for Ynys Món (Mr. Jones) said, that hides the unemployment in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Labour Government would modernise Britain's manufacturing base. Contrary to Tory members' sad misapprehension, the service sector can flourish only from a strong manufacturing base. The Tory achievement of the worst trade deficit in history plainly shows that we manufacture or perish. Labour will have a long-term, consistent and stable industrial policy that will allow companies to take decisions and plan for the future with confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that the economy had been transformed. I could not agree more it has been

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Grist 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party never ceases to surprise me. Labour Members never learn, although their intentions are good. They simply do not understand economics. They do not know what makes a business spark and what makes people want to use their initiative and enterprise to start and run a business and to employ people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), in his maiden speech, gave a classic example of confusion. He deplored the fact that the pound had drifted, and he called for it to be devalued. He got it right when he said that interest rates should be cut because that would result in the pound being devalued. What the hon. Gentleman does not realise is that calls for devaluation make the pound drift and keep interest rates up. That is why the talk of some Labour Members is so extremely damaging, but they cannot get the hang of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the stock market crash of 1987, which affected Japan, the USA and other countries as well as Britain. It produced panic that there would be a repeat of the 1920s crash; interest rates were cut and money was used to support the market. In a motion tabled on 5 November 1987, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) and other Labour Members urged us to cut interest rates and to spend even more. In this country and in others, we are reaping the effects of the whirlwind because we let go of the monetary reigns too suddenly, without realising the strength of the economies in the West that built up a terrific head of steam following the recession in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, few people realised how strong it was when the economic stays were released. Sir James Goldsmith, however, told everyone at the end of 1988 to sell up and get out because a crash was coming. People raised their eyebrows and wondered what he was talking about out, but they should have listened to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Neath called for investment in the coal industry. That is another example of the Labour Members' forgetfulness. The hon. Gentleman should know that £2 million in capital investment has gone into the coal industry for every working day since 1979. That is much better than anything the Labour party achieved. We now have a smaller but more efficient coal industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Would a Labour Government be committed to an open, competitive economy? Do they believe in the 1992 Act? Do they believe in Europe? The Labour party voted against the 1972 Act and against compulsory competitive tendering. It had to have a referendum because its own Cabinet split against remaining in the common market. The hon.

	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.

Such argument as there is in the Conservative party is about the way forward, not a way back, or a way out.

It is most extraordinary that they now put on a pretence hat and claim that they are great Europeans. Balderdash! Absolute rubbish!

That frightens the pants off them because they know that it would prevent their putting into operation most of the plans that some of them still secretly harbour—although, heavens above, they have tried to smother them.

The attitude of the Labour party is one of higher personal taxation and, a return of trade union powers that would allow secondary picketing and flying pickets all over again. The right hon.

Secondly, will he touch on the effects of the recession on the Welsh people in a way that his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not?

dancies and unemployment do not strike only constituents in the abstract; they strike the families of hon. Members personally. It is obvious that we are in a recession. No one would, or could, deny that. But in a period during which we have to burn off excess money that was pumped into the system, if people insist on pay rises of 10, 9, or 8 per cent when inflation is running at 9, 8, 7, and 6 per cent then, with flat production resulting from high interest rates leading off expenditure, unemployment will result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the Germans who, in the past, hit difficult periods and restrained their incomes, faced reality and ground their way through the difficulties, we insist on being paid at least the going rate of inflation. The effect is that many people have lost their jobs because businesses cannot sustain sales in a period of difficulty and rising labour costs. Labour costs in this country have outrun those of our competitors time and again. It a miracle that we have been able to hold the position that we have in many markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) wanted the Welsh Development Agency to operate as an interventionist agency concerned with low pay and social conditions. That was the nature of the animal when it was created by a Labour Government. The right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot) will recall that, before his party lost its majority, the Lib-Lab pact came into being and Labour became semi-paralysed and unable to do anything, that was the interventionist nature planned for the WDA. So, off we go again: that is the sort of animal that we would have if Labour formed a future Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) told us how wonderful training had been in the past. He said that when people lost their jobs, they did not have any skills. Apparently, they missed out on the tremendous amount of training that we had in the old industries. At least, that is what I understood the hon. Gentleman to be saying. I agree that training is extremely important. The hon. Member for Ynys Món (Mr. Jones) got round that by saying that training was not needed for low grade jobs, but that modern office work, for instance, needed a high degree of training. We have to get it through to parents and to the children themselves that children must stay on at school, must get their exams, and must go on to further education. It is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have promised two years training to all unemployed people leaving school. That is rare in Europe. Fewer people now leave Welsh schools without some public exam success. It was disgraceful that in the past, more than 30 per cent of pupils in mid-Glamorgan left school with no public exam success. That is why modern industry finds it difficult to recruit staff and why Bosch is having to train its recruits almost from scratch to the requiurements of a modern industrial firm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very rarely do I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I have some sympathy with the last few sentences of his speech. Why limit training so that people have to stay in dole queues for months or even years before they are offered a training opportunity? Surely the system should be sufficiently flexible to anticipate the training needs of people immediately they become unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with that point, but a high proportion of those who become unemployed find another job by themselves within the following two months. Re-entry into the job market is rapid for many; it would be rather foolish and wasteful immediately to put all the unemployed on training schemes when they can find work themselves and even got training on the job, which can be most valuable. I do not deny that I should like to see more training, but training starts back in the classroom, from where must start numeracy and literacy. Without that, training at a higher level for adults will be much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party again offers the old panacea of constitutional reform and upheaval. A change in local government is quite different from the establishment of assemblies and parliaments. The role of Members and of officers of state, and the question of where taxes are to be raised and who is to be responsible and answerable for them, are the big issues that would result from a proposal to establish a Welsh assembly. The Labour party always balks on that. It cannot accept the fact that an assembly would either have to raise taxes in its own right—which would go down like a lead balloon for the people of Wales; they would have to pay for the Welsh parliament themselves—or it would have to be raised by Parliament, which would have the right and duty to continue to control expenditure in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has damaging proposals for a minimum wage. Opposition Members have heard the beguiling arguments long before now. A minimum wage is a long runner. It it deeply and damagingly unpopular in many of the countries where it has been applied, and whose employers have said that we would be foolish to follow them. Most of our leading trade unions that represent skilled workers take the same line, as does the Fabian Society, which has given more thought to the matter than some Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is familiar with party political history.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might like to know that one of the reasons why Barbara Castle did not introduce the minimum wage at the time was that she introduced the Equal Pay Act 1970. That brought a fundamental improvement to the pay and conditions of women. It was opposed for all the same arguments that we have heard over the past couple of months. Would the hon. Gentleman oppose the Equal Pay Act now? One fifth of women in Wales earned less than £120 a week last year. Would the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not remember opposing such a measure; I doubt that I did. That is not on a square with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
minimum wage, which would apply to all employees. A minimum wage would adversely affect female employment, part-time employment and employment of young people. A minimum wage would damage their opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is helping us with his assessment, does he think that a minimum wage would drag us down to the level of the German economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The German economy is having to put up with many problems, including rising inflation. If Britain and other countries continued with their present economic policies over the next two years, Germany Would end up with the highest inflation rate in the EEC. That strange turn of events is due to Germany's crazy exchange rate for the ostmark of one for one. That has had a catastrophic effect on the economy, which demonstrates the danger of going in for exchange mechanisms without thinking them through clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party was mad keen on Britain joining the exchange rate mechanism, but it gets it wrong everytime. It does not understand the efforts that go into forming profitble, efficient, competitive companies that can offer long-term jobs. Those cmpanies offer long-term benefits to the economy. Labour Members will never nderstand that, because they are flat earthers, flat society people. They are dim people who want a dull society where no one is successful. No one will fall through; no one will rise up. The Conservative party still offers Wales an opportunity to sparkle. We allow the Welsh to believe in the future and in themselves. They have established companies in unprecedented numbers. They have made a go of things for themselves and escaped from the idea that one always has to remain an employee. They know that they can be self-employed and make a go of life. They can acquire skills and go out into the world and succeed. The Conservative party has striven for that; the Labour party never has and never will understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Rising unemployment and the recession have been the price that we have had to pay to get inflation down. That price is well worth paying."—	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1991; Vol. 191, c. 413.]</p></blockquote>

The Secretary of State's opening remarks this morning went over the history of the Government's 11 years in office. I wish to talk about the experience in my constituency. In Ogmore in 1979 unemployment was 3.7 per cent. Within two years, in parts of the constituency, it had shot up to 37 per cent. That was because of the Government's decision to deman the steel works at Margam which put 12,000 people out of work, about 75 per cent of whom lived in my constituency. Further to that, the government decided to close coal mines in the constituency. There were seven collieries employing 6,500 miners in Ogmore. Within three years, every mine was closed, and today there is not a miner employed in the constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A total of 14,500 people—the 8,000 plus workers from the Margan steelworks and the 6,500 miners—were put on the dole overnight by the Government. Since then, a number of interested and devoted people in the constituency have made every effort to train people for different skills and different jobs. Lo and behold, after 10 years of this trial, the Government introduced TECs and ET. The Secretary of State spoke about them earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before this afternoon's sitting, I sat in the Chamber and listened to the statement by the Secretary of State for Employment. While I listened, I wondered why there had been no hint from the Secretary of State for Wales about what effect that statement would have on the people of Wales. In the statement, made at 3.30 pm, the Secretary of State for Employment said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon. Friends and I will be inviting the training and enterprise councils in England and Wales and the local enterprise companies in Scotland to take the lead in setting up this new programme."</p></blockquote>
I have mentioned the high unemployment in my constituency of Ogmore. Even the adjusted figures recently announced by the Department of Employment puts the unemployment rate in Ogmore at 15.9 per cent. The number of people on ET and CATO schemes in Ogmore last year was 400. There were 45 full-time employees and trainers, who had devoted 10 years to training people for jobs. Over 10 years, 4,000 people have been afforded the opportunity, under CATO, to be trained and accepted for employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement today promised an extra £110 million in 1991–92 and £230 million in 1992–93, but that is only tickling the problem. It does not solve it. The Opposition spokesman on employment, my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), highlighted in graphic detail what the Government have done in the past 12 months to cut funding for employment training schemes such as CATO. Even to get us back to the position before last year's cuts were made would require funding substantially greater than has been proposed this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about when we can expect a fall in unemployment in all constituencies, but especially in my own constituency of Ogmore. Since 1980–81, the Government have promise time and time again that unemployment would be brought under control. It is about time Conservative Members—and a few Labour Members as well—began to understand what happens
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
to people who have been made unemployed. There is the degradation of trying to keep up mortgage payments, of telling one's children that, at 55, there is no chance of ever being employed again, and of being unable to take one's grandchildren out for trips on a Sunday because running a car is too expensive. Sometimes people are unable to ensure that the larder is kept as well stocked as when they were in work. When I meet such people in my surgery, they ask me for advice about getting a job, any job. But in my constituency it is impossible to find work for them. A Labour Government's first task will be to ensure that the long-term unemployed are given the opportunity of employment.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Conservative Members are interested in the Labour party's proposals for a national legal minimum wage. Fabian Society pamphlet no. 545 by Fred Bayliss on making a minium wage work has been widely quoted and is very interesting. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The commitment was in the Party's manifesto for the last general election, and will be in the manifesto for the next one. The recent policy document 	<i>Opportunity Britain</i> promises that 'side by side with our National Economic Assessment, we will introduce a national legal minimum wage, starting at a level of 50 per cent of median men's earnings. Over time, we will increase the minimum wage as a proportion of earnings to a point where no-one is paid less than two thirds of the median male hourly rate.' … Turning the proposal into a practical reality will not be easy."</p></blockquote>
We accept that the pamphlet continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Its simplicity is one of its chief attractions—an hourly rate of pay below which no one can be legally employed. But the significance of a"—</p></blockquote>
national legal minimum wage—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for pay determination generally and its impact on the conduct of employers and trade unions are complicated. Unless they are fully taken into account a NLMW could be a failure."</p></blockquote>
I shall refer to the document entitled "Supplement to Welsh Economic Trends", which was published by the Welsh Office. Pages 31 to 52 show that no area of Wales had an average weekly wage for full-time workers equal to or more than the average for the rest of the United Kingdom. That shows clearly what happens in Wales and what we are paid in comparison with the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud to be the senior Member of Parliament sponsored by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, and, if anyone is low paid in this country, the shop workers are. It is high time that they had a minimum wage for the energy and effort that they put into society, and it is high time that the Labour

	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
party reasserted its 1986 commitment to introduce a national legal minimum wage. The Conservatives may believe that that would result in job losses, but we shall make up for those job losses by ensuring that, when workers are employed, they are given a minimum wage and reasonable agreements. That has been sadly lacking since 1979 when the Conservative Government was first elected. The assessment of the past 11 years is that the standard that was enjoyed by the trade union movement has been sadly depleted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a Division in the House and presumably our proceedings will continue a little longer after 6 pm when they would normally finish.

The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central obviously supports the Prime Minister, but everyone in the country will be confused because, in a newspaper that supports us, the main headline today in the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Now they're all running the country."</p></blockquote>
We want to know and I am sure that the whole country wants to know who is running the country. The 	<i>Daily Mail</i> reported a speech by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), the former Prime Minister, under the headline, "Heath blasts 'lying' Maggie." Later the same day, the 	<i>Evening Standard,</i> which is read by most Members of Parliament because there is always a copy in the Dining Room and it can be bought from the newspaper stall outside the tube station on the way here, carried an article under the heading "Insults fly over Europe" in which the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) was described as a nasty bigot, and the right hon. Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) was labelled an alley cat; they are misleading the Government by attacking each other. They are stabbing each other in the back and driving hatchets into each other's heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country wishes to know what action is being taken by the Opposition towards the policies pursued by the Government. The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) might talk about supporting the Prime Minister, but he did not support the previous Prime Minister. Despite being a Heselteenie the Secretary of State obtained his job a short time ago because the Government could not find anyone else in Wales to fill the post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

During this Parliament, we have lost far too many fine hon. Members. I also congratulate the right hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Thomas) on being made a Privy Councillor. I attributed to him the name "Bardic steamroller" in Committee when we were discussing the legislation on steel. The phrase was coined by me and my son. It was a tribute to the Bardic intransigence with which the right hon. Gentleman rolled over each argument, fact and plea that we put to him. I hope that he will demonstrate a different side to his nature this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) on his excellent contribution to the debate. We know how well he is fighting for the Neath constituency, which many of us now hold in great affection because of the time that we spent there in the run-up to the by-election. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) on his speech. He spoke with great authority about the way in which his constituency had felt the effects of the recession. The Committee will benefit greatly from his contributions for a long time to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will listen to the reasoned arguments advanced my my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth, especially in discussions about wage levels. The Secretary of State accepts that that matter requires serious attention because of the number of people who are having to take on part-time and low-paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) a happy birthday. He has left the Room, so he is obviously on his way to celebrate it. During my time in the Whips' office, he was the only member of that establishment who had seven birthdays a year. I am not sure which one he is celebrating today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been sad. We all expected the Secretary of State for Wales, given the authority of his office, to rise above pettiness and tackle a serious issue for the people of Wales—the damaging effects of the recession on the economy and social life of many communities. Sadly, the Government ran away from that issue, and changed the subject of the debate from the recession, which the Opposition had suggested, to the blander issue of the economy in Wales. I suspect that they were trying to avoid dealing with the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) acted in a statemanlike way, giving praise where it was due and realistic criticism for the Government's failure to tackle the recession. The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) frankly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
conceded Labour's contributions, while showing his usual and commendable loyalty to his party and to the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend, the Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) provided a series of frightening facts about job losses in his constitutency. Similary, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) told the Committee about the devastating job losses at Hoover, an issue that the Secretary of State did not deal with in the debate. My hon. Friend spoke of the skills and training that are required. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) spoke of his pride in the traditional skills of the valley communities, which will be lost without the necessary training opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) was prepared to defend the Secretary of State. He would be better advised to note the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and the 55 per cent increase in unemployment in Cardiff, North. The hon. Member for Cardiff, North and the honourable sparkler, the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) should be fighting for the city of Cardiff. They should tell the Secretary of State that he should not only consider schemes to help the economy but fight in the Cabinet for realistic economic policies to address the needs of Wales. We criticise the Government not for schemes that slide over the surface but for their underlying management of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said boldly that long-term unemployment had been reduced from 78,000 to 26,000 since 1986. Why did he choose 1986? The beginnings of massive, long-term unemployment were created by the Government long before 1986. That date was selected to show a comparative improvement, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda. The Secretary of State said that the number of employers had increased. However, many of those new employment opportunities are part time. Many self-employed people accept very low wages in order to survive in employment instead of going on the dole. The growth that took place in some sectors was like that of a mushroom that appeared and then vanished. The bull points did not address the events of recent years. The Secretary of State selected years to suit his argument. He is the Secretary of State for froth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that we would be given information in the Minister's closing speech that we should have received before the beginning of the debate. I suspect that that was a means of avoiding giving us information that was later to be announced on the Floor of the House. We should have known about the fresh measures to tackle unemployment. It is a disgrace and a scandal that those facts were announced on the Floor of the House, yet we were not given an explanation in advance about how they would affect Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the new measures? In his statement, the Secretary of State for employment said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has become apparent that for some unemployed people the most effective help that we can give is work experience to keep their skills up to date."</p></blockquote>
That has come as a surprise to him. It is bloody obvious, if you will pardon my language, Mr. Hughes. we have been telling the Government that for a long time. We told them when they removed similar elements in
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
previous employment schemes—such as CATO, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore referred—that provided opportunities for people. Those opportunities have been taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government took away opportunities, they also took away other benefits—heat retention for the elderly, for example, which is so important, as we know how hypothermia can strike so many of our elderly people. That is only one example of the many excellent schemes that also enabled people to keep their skills alive; but the Government did away with them, devastating many people. All we have heard today is that the Government are to restore measures that we had already put in place but which they took away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that he was keen to emphasise the importance of agriculture. He appears to be less keen to help farmers and others who work in the agricultural sector. He stressed his success with the Japanese; but when did he praise the Labour councils and trade unionists in south Wales who made the inward investment possible? He was begrudging in his acknowledgment of the valuable work of those councils, and he did so only when he was cajoled into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valleys initiative and the railway services that we need so much are other examples. In Mid and South Glamorgan, money was invested in the railways by the two county councils because British Rail was denied money by the Government. Yet British Rail still does not have enough to spend on rolling stock, which is necessary to keep people moving and the regional economy alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Links with Germany have been developed by our local authorities, which have a proud record on inward investment. I am sure that other Opposition Members would wish to join me in paying tribute to that record. Some of my hon. Friends have already done so in our debate. We wish that councils had the resources that they need from the Government, and that they had the freedom to operate more effectively than they can now on the meagre resources that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State recently confessed that there was a problem over wage levels and low pay in Wales. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey) commented on employment in Bosch, but also on the low levels of employment in many sectors of the economy. He joined an effective cross-party plea to face up to the real problems of the Welsh economy—facing up to the bad, while recognising and praising improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to face up to poor wage levels—either through a national minimum wage or other measures, if the Government have enough imagination to devise them. Wages should be brought up to a reasonable living level for all our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State suggested that when Labour was in power Opposition Members would have given their eye teeth for the present flexible economy in Wales. We certainly would have given our eye teeth—and we shall still do so after the next election—for the Government's £100 billion in oil revenues, which could have been invested in our people but which have been squandered, as my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) said, during the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State also referred to renewed optimism among the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, accusing Opposition Members of painting a picture of doom and gloom. However, it would have been easier to paint a bright picture if the Secretary of State had not gone overboard by painting an overbright picture and ignoring the dark elements of the economy. That is why we have had to stress those aspects—not because we like emphasising doom and gloom, but because we want to face up to and overcome the problems of the Welsh economy. We look forward to the next general election when we shall have the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Neath quoted the chief executive of Cardiff chamber of commerce and industry, which is a much better harbinger of good and bad than the CBI. It is closer to the grassroots of industry and its remarks are pertinent. At the end of April, a report produced by the chamber stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"future investment plans are down yet again in both sectors"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the manufacturing and service sectors—
	<br><blockquote><p>"perhaps the most worrying sign of all, since an inability to respond rapidly to an upturn when it comes will protract the agony and reduce the British competitive position in the Single Market."</p></blockquote>
That single market is just around the corner, and we must be ready for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, we see the effects of high interest rates. More than 1,000 farms are in the hands of the banks and thousands of other farmers are plunged heavily into debt. Small businesses are devasted. Some are just holding on and some will take years to recover. A litany of closures has been cited by hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). Home owners have been hit by a combination of higher payments and cuts in family income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is concentration on inflation the right approach? I believe that I am right in saying that zero inflation was last seen when troops were sent down the mines. It appears that the Tories are determined to drag Wales back to the 1920s and 1930s. The Government caused the leap in inflation by a unique combination of dogmatism and careless opportunism. Conservatism is now identified with uncertainty and a frightening lack of direction in the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider demand in our economy, which has dropped in all sectors in the past 18 months, since the peak time of activity. That drop has been as much as 40 per cent in various sectors. It has taken Welsh industry back to a pre-1987 level of demand across the sectors of industry. That volatility is the most unhealthy aspect of all. One industrialist told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I'd rather see 1.5 per cent per annum growth year on year than a mushroom growth of 40 per cent followed by a collapse of 40 per cent in the following year or so."</p></blockquote>
Another said to me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We now have a sound customer base in Europe where there is stability in the markets. Without that, if we"—</p></blockquote>
that is, his firm—
	<br><blockquote><p>"were dependent on the UK market, we'd be really struggling."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
Our companies want stability of growth in a healthy economy. A company cannot be planned and managed properly in the atmosphere of uncertainty that this Government have created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inflation is coming down—well, thank God for that—but who put it up in the first place? The most important question is, "How does it compare with our competitors?" Germany has 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent inflation; it was nil or negative when we were last at 4 per cent. The real measure is comparison with our continental competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon. Friends have commented on education and training, not simply the schemes and the syllabus, but the environment of expectation among adults and young people that are important in Wales. We heard from the Secretary of State a bizarre claim of having increased training opportunities through ET, but we heard the truth from my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell). We have heard from the TECs and from several hon. Members about the cuts in training that the TECs have had to make in their first year of existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other week, I visited a place in my constituency that had been a training workshop for adults with learning difficulties, only to find that it was no longer part of employment training. The trainers were on the dole and the trainees were no longer in training. However, the trainers were coming back voluntarily because of their commitment and the trainees were turning up without receiving a training allowance. That reflects the need for training and shows how people in our communities have been abandoned by the Government's schemes and the mismanagement of the economy. One industrialist commented to me—and this reflects the environment in which such events are taking place—that most young people aged 14½ expect to end their education at 16. That gives them a low perspective and a low expectation. We need to raise their perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Secretary of State and the Minister that during the first Tory recession in the 1980s I was not in the House; I was working with with young unemployed people on an estate in Cardiff. They had a tremendous positive response when opportunities were given to them. When they saw doors open, they were keen to go through them. The devastation of that recession slammed doors in their faces and led to the waste of their potential for learning skills. That was not simply a loss to our economy for a short period of time; it wrecked lives. That is what is happening again. The economy may bounce back a little in another false dawn but, for those who have been rejected in their middle age or in their youth, the rejection will last a lifetime. That wast of skill, ability and productive capacity is a loss to all of us. As my learned Friend the Member for Rhondda said, if those people are not provided with opportunities to develop and sharpen their skills inward investment will not find its way to the valleys. Some firms are surviving on merit, and all credit to them, but where are the Government's successes?

Welsh Water announced an operating profit of £128 million—£45 per head of population in Wales—at a time when families are paying an extra 16.2 per cent for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
water. Contrasts are illuminating, and the attitude of Ministers has been a problem. There has been horror and amazement among ordinary people as the pay packets of leading business men have risen by tens, or even hundreds of thousands of pounds. Ministers have ignored those increses because it does not suit them to do otherwise. The chairman of Welsh Water has been praised for his restraint because he earns a little under £100,000 a year and because he limited his pay rise to 27 per cent this year. I should like to hear Ministers praise low-paid hospital workers, who would be only too glad to limit themselves to a 27 per cent increase. They, too, are part of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To understand the way in which the psychology needs to change, let us remember places where an attempt has been made to build a sense of community in a place of employment. Last year, Allied Steel and wire, which has its headquarters in my constituency, declared improved results yet again—but, seeing the onset of a recession, and being sensitive to the market and the economy, ASW's directors and top management took a cut in pay, at a time when the company was doing well, because they believed that if there is pain to be borne, it should be shared. I pay tribute to their realism. If a price is worth paying, we must pay it together and earn the results together rather than leave it to the low-paid and those who are most defenceless in our society to pay the price. Ministers have said that we must be realistic and control inflation. We must manage the economy for the benefit of everyone in Wales, but realism and good management must await a general election and the return of a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One of the most remarkable aspects of Opposition Members' speeches is that there has been no mention of the recession in other countries, with which we trade, such as the United States and Canada. Only my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) took up the point made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about the United States being in tis 10th month of recession. I am told that, in April, industrial production there was 3.4 per cent down on the previous April, that there has been a 6 per cent fall in Canada, that the recession is hitting countries as far apart as Finland and Australia, and that even Switzerland is not immune. France and Italy have also experienced falls in their gross domestic product. The recession that Wales is suffering is not unique to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our debate nears its end, it is right that we look forward. One thing is certain we are defeating inflation and thereby creating conditions for a return to sustainable growth. That will provide the basis for better living standards and will improve public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), I do not expect the
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
recession to be as deep and as prolonged as the recession of the early 1980s. There is much less inflation to be squeezed out of the system. As my hon. Friend and Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) said, our economy, and that of many other countries, is in better shape now than it was in the early 1980s. Recent trends do not show that the recession is getting deeper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the timing is inevitably uncertain, we look forward to recovery. The worst of the recession is probably behind us, and we are experiencing falls in inflation that point to recovery ahead. Recovery will come from a revival of consumer confidence in response to falling inflation, lower interest rates and an upturn in the world economy. Provided that we can achieve and maintain a low-inflation economy, the prospects are good, as is the outlook for the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is far better placed now than it has been to take advantage of recovery. Since 1979, the number of firms in the production industries has grown faster in Wales than anywhere else—it is currently two thirds more than it was in 1979. There has been an increase of more than 30 per cent in Welsh manufacturing output since 1985, which is more than double the United Kingdom's figure. What a change these figures spell out for the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transformation is due to the advent of new companies, including those from overseas. For example, in 1979 there were about 175 foreign companies in Wales; now there are 330, which employ 57,000 people. I wish

The foreign companies that are in Wales are well placed to take advantage of the European single market and the opportunities that are offered by eastern Europe. Meanwhile, we do ourselves no favours by concentrating on the fact of the recession to the exclusion of everything else. As is abundantly clear, there is a good deal of optimism among businesses in Wales. We are still securing a significant number of excellent quality inward investments. We should not forget that the recession has by no means wiped out the gains of the past few years. We have a strategy for dealing with the recent, and most regrettable, series of job losses. There is, of course, no instant cure, and those who seek on are deluded
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our recipe for dealing with those problems is to use a range of measures, most of which were set out by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State this morning. They are aimed at stimulating the economy in appropriate, different ways and focusing on different opportunities or areas where there are particular problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this afternoon, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment made an important announcement about a further substantial increase—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell us what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am doing, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further substantial increase in measures to help unemployed people back to work. In addition to the wide range of measures already provided, we are now introducing a new programme called "Employment Action". It will be targeted on those who have been unemployed for six months or more, and the training and enterprise councils will take the lead in its operation. "Employment Action" will provide work experience in local projects to help people to keep their skills up to date. Extra resources for employment will be concentrated on those with special training needs. There will be also be extra help available to long-term unemployed people through measures operated by the employment service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extra Great Britain resources to be made available for those measures will be £110 million this year and £230 million next year. That substantial new package is evidence of our commitment to help people back to work as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that the package of measures announced by my right hon. and learned Friend will provide help to 10,000 individuals in Wales this year and 12,500 next year. However, I cannot tell the Committee what the share of money for Wales will be because we are still working on the distribution, which will be based on the relative levels of unemployment and unemployment flows. Further, the training and enterprise councils will be invited to negotiate for their shares of the "Employment Action" programme on the basis of need and what they think they can provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been told about "Employment Action", and our understanding is that people will be employed for benefit plus £10—which will be worse than employment training when they received benefit plus £10, but at least they had training. This outrageous new scheme will mean that people are working for nothing. That is the privilege being given to them by the Government. People will receive so-called work experience, but the unemployed will be getting a worse deal than they do now with employment training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was in the Chamber when my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Employment made his statement. I was also in the Chamber, and what the hon. Gentleman said was not my understanding of what my right hon. and learned Friend said in reply to questions from the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman now say whether any of the measures announced this afternoon, or any changes in the pipeline will allow an unemployed person to seek immediate training or retraining under the schemes? As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) asked, an unemployed person will have to wait in the dole queue for six months or, in some cases, for two years before he qualifies for any of these training provisions? Will the right hon. Gentleman answer yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the point made by the hon. Gentleman. The latest information I have from the mid-Glamorgan TEC is that it is not applying the ET eligibility criteria in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman. In fact, next week it is mounting a two-day exhibition in Merthyr college to draw attention to the opportunities that ET provides. In other words, it has a considerable number of vacancies which it is trying to fill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it have to wait?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is well aware that there are a variety of criteria for various schemes. He is also well aware of what my right hon. and learned Friend said, namely that half of those who go on to the unemployment register remove themselves from it in three months because they find a job. Two-thirds of them move very quickly from that register—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must pursue the question. If an individual who is unemployed—at whatever age—says that he wants to be trained in a scheme of one sort or another, will he be allowed to embark on that scheme or will he be forced to wait for a period of time in the dole queue before he qualifies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already dealt with that point. The hon. Gentleman is seeking a clear answer to individual problems. We have already spoken about the variety of schemes that are available—ET, youth training and so on—and the varying criteria that exist. Additionally, there are job clubs, job counselling sessions and the like. If an individual went to the employment service, received counselling and was advised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
that he should enter a training scheme, arrangements would be made for him to do so. It is one of the available options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Expenditure on training in Wales is already substantial. Total provision for training in Wales in 1991–92 is £151 million, and TECs will receive some £110 million. In addition, TECs have significant flexibility to ensure that better value for money can be achieved. The new package just announced will further increase spending in Wales this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As TECs have requested, more of their money from Government will be related to real results—jobs, qualifications and business success—which means better value for money for the taxpayer and a better deal for trainees, with the emphasis on results, rather than placed filled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are spending two-and-a-half times more on training in real terms than was spent in 1970. Employers have the lion's share of responsibility for training. The recent CBI survey showed that many more employers are planning to increase expenditure on training, which is a sign of the strength of their commitment, built up despite the downturn in the economy. The survey shows that that commitment is at its strongest in Wales. About 36 per cent of employers expect to increase spending on training, compared with 8 per cent in the rest of the United Kingdom. We have no choice. If we are to retain our position in the international market, we must constantly upgrate the level of skills in the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have allocated an additional £8.41 million for ET in Wales, an increase on the original allocation of just
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
over 15 per cent. The additional funding is to allow ET to continue to play its important role in helping long-term unemployed people and those with special needs back to work. There will now be a further tranche of ET provision to enable the programme to be even more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additional resources demonstrate our commitment to giving practical support and advice to those who lose their jobs. The priority for the Government and for TECs is to ensure that help is available for the long-term unemployed. Establishing a network of providers of high-quality training is also very important, but it is for TECs to decide with whom they contract to ensure adequate provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying to put across to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is that ET may not always be the best way to help some people return to the work place. For many, the most effective measures are those provided by the employment service, such as jobsearch and help in securing an interview. Expenditure on those and other measures to help unemployed people has been increased. TECs are obliged to provide suitable training that meets the needs of local employers and local people, including those with special training needs. I have to say to the hon. Member that the latest information from the mid-Glamorgan TEC is that ET eligibility criteria will not be applied in the way he suggested this morning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
