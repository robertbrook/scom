	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day</i>].
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter or rural Wales.—[	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was referring to dripping from the countryside, according to the hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones). The reason for the dripping out of people from the agriculture industry is income levels, which have been mentioned. There was a fall in farm incomes of more that 23 per cent in 1990 compared with 1989, and of more than 18 per cent on the 1988 figure. In that period, total farming income in Wales fell by more that 41 per cent. It is relatively worse because of the higher dependence in Wales on the livestock sector. The farm business survey results show that all dairy and livestock incomes fell by 22 per cent last year to £12,000 a year. However, in the hill and upland livestock farm area—the area that I live in and have represented for 17 years—incomes fell by 37 per cent and are down to an average of just under £9,000 a year. Net interest charges of some £4,000 have to be deducted from that figure, leaving a little over £5,000—if that—for the management of investment. Those staggering figures do not allow for the difficult market conditions that farmers had to face during 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look to the Secretary of State who is responsible for agriculture in Wales—and to his colleagues in the other agriculture departments to ensure that we have greater stability in the returns from agricultural support policies. In that context, we look to the common agricultural policy and to the points for "modulation"—to use the jargon—which have been produced by Commissioner MacSharry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise the positive aspects of improving and augmenting farm incomes that could arise out of developing the CAP to give farmers further responsibility for preserving the environment, the landscape and the family farm model of agriculture. We must continue to emphasise the dual role of the farming enterprise, not only in maintaining employment and production in the countryside but in maintaining the environment. We need even more encouragement for extensification of the less intensive production techniques. We must ensure that any income aid measures within the CAP framework—the form is now being discussed—relate to factors such as the size, income and terrain of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
region in which the operation takes place. All those objectives, which now form part of the discussion of the MacSharry proposals, can be related to the particular needs of Welsh agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is a need to examine coherently countryside planning policies. The response from agriculture through environmental concerns to a greening of attitudes towards the countryside has been positive. Farmers are willing to enter into a voluntary partnership with conservation and that is evident from the activity on many farms. We need to extend the partnership by making it more attractive for farmers to invest in environmental conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone concerned about agriculture welcomes the shift of emphasis from production-based support to other forms of support through guidance and through payments for environmental conservation consideration. The simple way to augment that would be for environmentally sensitive area-type schemes to be extended to all agricultural land, including national parks and other designated areas. Some members of the Committee were members of the Committee that introduced ESAs. The intention then was to ensure conservation in areas that were not already designated. There is a clear argument for extending that approach to national parks and to the whole countryside to ensure that environmentally friendly policies are pursued everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be argued that payments should be tiered so that they relate better to the income needs of small enterprises. The same can be said to apply to the hill livestock compensatory allowances, where a more tapered form of payment would ensure that they related more closely to the farm's income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have emphasised the agricultural position because our countryside policy can never succeed without it. Over the years emphasis has been put on reorganising agriculture and creating viable units, but that has been at a social cost. There has been a relative gain in income levels for production in a period of growth in the industry, but now that spending on the CAP has to be further reduced, the emphasis on units of size and viability needs to be shifted to maintain the support that is also relevant to environmental needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office should be well placed to deal with those changes. It should have more input into what is happening in European agricultural policy. That is my final and critical point: I should not want to make a speech that was entirely uncritical of the Government or of the present Secretary of State or his predecessor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Feel free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I want to make is that the Welsh Office is not taking enough direct responsibility itself for negotiations within the CAP. It is argued that it is better to have one European agricultural Minister, who happens to be the English Minister—to use the nice term used by one quasi or crypto-nationalist on the Opposition Benches. It tends to be the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. For fisheries, it is Scottish Minister, but for sheepmeat, or other aspects of livestock policy, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
is a good argument for having the Welsh Office Minister in his—or her—own right to represent the United Kingdom's interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. I hesitate to interrupt when the hon. Gentleman is in a great peroration. I should like to remain to listen to the debate, but I must be elsewhere. As there are cameras present, hon. Members who are obliged to leave the Committee should make their excuses. I must attend the Committee on Selection. That is of importance to you, Mr. Hughes, because your Badgers Bill is on the Committee's agenda. Some hon. Members may want to leave the Committee, and people in Wales such as my constituents may wonder why I am not in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Explanations of that sort are not customary in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I think the case of the fisheries in Scotland—I am repeating myself because I was interrupted. The Scottish Office Minister responsible for fisheries has represented the United Kingdom. As for the livestock industry, there is a good reason for a Welsh Office Minister to represent the United Kingdom. That would be a small step in the context of European unity and a big step for the status of the Welsh Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations on your selection as Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Hughes, and my commiserations on the manner in which you were called to the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Secretary of State's aid for the rural economy, but there was a slight dichotomy in his argument. He talked of a market-based rural economy but went on to say that we must spend much more on intervention in that economy. I agree with that for social resasons, but it has not been the stated philosophy of the Government for the past 12 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that he would give £20 million extra, up to £1 million a day. That is good, but I calculate it to be a 6 per cent increase. If it is an annual amount, it is not keeping up with inflation. Is it in addition to inflation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approve of the rural initiative of the Welsh Development Agency, which as my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), the shadow Secretary of State for Wales said, was set up by a Labour Government, as were other bodies that had more money given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rural initiative is overdue, and its efforts must be targeted on the areas most in need. In my area, Colwyn and Denbigh are most in need of such help. The help outlined by the Minister will do little for the rural economy in those areas because farming is the major employer, and the knock-on effects of farming problems are wider than is suggested by the level of farm employment. Seedsmen, agricultural merchants, repair men, providers of machinery and,
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
as my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) says, lorry drivers would be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment in rural areas is hidden. There is a major recession in the United Kingdom, including Wales. In a recent reply, the Secretary of State was kind enough to tell mne that in January there were 11,383 people claiming unemployment benefit in Clwyd and 101,452 in Wales as a whole. Those figures do not represent the numbers of people who are out of work, which are what I sought. Instead, they are the product of the Government's method of calculating unemployment, which, as all hon. Members know, has been changed 26 times. On only one occasion did a change in the method of calculation increase the figures. Every other change reduced the figures. However, even according to the Government's measure, there are now more than 100,000 people unemployed in Wales. The 1978 total, calculated according to the old rules, was 100,000, so there has been no great success in fighting unemployment in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rural unemployment is a different problem. The Government give the figure for the number of people claiming unemployment benefit, but many people who work in agriculture do so on a part-time, seasonal or family basis. They do not receive a full living wage, but retain the hope that they will become farmers in their own right in future. That hope is growing increasingly fainter among the farming community. Conditions in constituencies such as mine are worse than at any time in more than 10 years. Similar areas throughout the United Kingdom are beginning to suffer a decline of catastrophic proportions as a result of the continuing pressures of falling prices, crippling interest rates and high inflation. Admittedly, the weather has played a part, as always in farming, but I do not blame the Government for last year's drought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not? I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other hon. Members are happy to blame the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Foot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is responsible for the weather.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that the Minister of State is responsible for the weather. I had not realised that that was part of his curriculum vitae.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could have helped by handling the various food scares with more skill, especially those aroused by bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In addition, they could have shown more strength in the face of French protectionism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the problem of food protection. Does he not agree that the Government took a large step backward by introducing new legislation to raise hygiene standards while at the same time ensuring that local authorities must pay for all the samples that they send to the public health laboratory service? It is a scandal that the Government should make it more difficult to maintain hygiene standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend completely. He has made a very valid point. When I had a proper job, I used to work in a laboratory, and it is very important that the public health laboratory service remains properly funded. It was set up because private laboratories operating in the free market could not deal with such work. It is possible now that the person who may be responsible for an outbreak of food poisoning will have to pay to have samples of produce tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A firmer Government response to French protectionism over lambs would have helped our sheep farmers considerably. Farmers, especially those with small family farms, are in an invidious position. To maintain their income they have to intensify their farming and grow more crops because price support is linked to crop production. It is as simple as that. Farmers with only a small acreage do not find that solution helpful. Intensive farming damages their farms. It can harm the natural environment, grub up hedgerows and make larger fields and increase soil erosion. The farm literally slips away. On the other hand, current methods of farm support, which are discredited by consumers and taxpayers, do not even have the effect of supporting their sort of farming. I do not wish to use the phrase "on the other hand" too often—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will run out of hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall run out of hands as my hon. Friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers have to work with the pressures on them that I have described in a social structure which is disintergrating rapidly. In rural Wales, schools and shops are being closed, bus services are disappearing and even pubs are being shut down. When I had a proper job, I worked in the brewing industry. I consider that if pubs are closing there must be a genuine, unmitigated recession. If prices continue to decline, farmers will be unable to continue in agriculture and will, therefore, be unable to protect the amenity value and visual beauty of the countryside. Things have become worse since October 1990, when draft ewes were selling for £15; in 1989 they made £27 and in 1988 they were £35. In the document "Agriculture in the United Kingdom 1990" the Government's national figures for the United Kingdom show a significant decline over the past three years. Members of the Committee have made that point, but we must continue to reiterate it. In the past farmers have tended to cry wolf, but they now face grave difficulties. The present system of support tends to make the situation worse for the small farmer because it is tied to price support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, farming incomes in Wales were cut by more than £12 million. In 1989 there was a drop of £20 million. If prices continue to decline and price support is also cut, farming has little future on the hills of Wales. People who are not swelling the unemployment lists and who are hard-working sons and daughters of farmers are keeping family farms going for a pittance, but they may not be able to continue farming in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The drop in farming prices is bad enough for farmers, but they have had to pay higher prices for machinery and face huge interest rate increases, the poll tax and the uniform business rate which has made it easier to run a business in the south-east of England than a farm in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thanks to deregulation some areas of my constituency no longer have bus services and deregulation was supposed to have the opposite effect. The Government were warned time and again about that. All those factors make the rural situation even more dire. They do not stop there. Water connection charges have quintupled in my area thanks to the privatisation of water companies. Telephone connection charges have also risen. Post offices have been forced to close. The rural environment in Wales and elsewhere is under serious threat. If farmers are driven off the land, as is already happening, whole parishes will become wastelands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers of family farms in my constituency have told me that they feel powerless and that they have no control over the situation. They see lambs being sold in Tesco for £70 for the equivalent value of the meat, when they received perhaps £20 for the lamb. They see their bills rising remorselessly. They see cattle tied up, as it were, and equipment that they cannot use or employ people to use because they cannot afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government doing? I welcome the rural economy initiative. It is probably churlish of me to say this—unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) on the Front Bench, I can afford to be churlish—but it is not enough. Nor will it affect farming or help the agricultural structure of rural areas. There has been a small increase of 14 per cent. in hill livestock compensatory allowance payments. Conservative Members might say that that is not small, but when one compares it with the 22 per cent. by which farm incomes have fallen in the past 12 months, it does not look big. It is welcome, but not big enough. The standard 1991 price figure for HLCA payments of £142 million throughout the United Kingdom is in real terms the same as that paid in 1988 and less than that in 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CAP and how we reform it has been discussed by several hon. Members. Everyone agrees that it does not work and does not help our farmers or the consumer. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for England has rightly rubbished MacSharry's proposals. It is fair to say that when the proposals were first leaked and we did not realise what the definition of a family farm or small farm was going to be, he was not wrong to start with the broad view—which many hon. Members accept—that the European Community must seek to stop giving large sums of public money to efficient producers who need no support to make a good living, and find a means of targeting subsidies on selected groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a sedentary comment about the selected groups being the Germans and French, which is fair comment at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for England has not come up with any concrete proposals to reform the CAP. He hides behind the fact that such reforms must be agreed with all the other members of the European Community. That may be so, but it seems to me that the farmers of Portugal, Spain, France and Germany do pretty well out of MacSharry's proposals. I suspect that they will continue to do so if the United Kingdom goes into Europe without firm policies and proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have a problem because the Government's philosophy for the past 10 or 11 years has been deregulation and the removal of public intervention. The report of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for England on the Government's expenditure plans for 1991–92 to 1993–94—it is the only concrete evidence that the Government intend to reform the CAP—says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believes in increasing the role of market forces, reducing support and protection".</p></blockquote>
Saying that the Government also believe in improving budgetary discipline and management is like believing in motherhood and apple pie—impossible to argue against. However, the Government are talking about market forces and the world market. Even the Minister attending the Select Committee yesterday said that the world market price was a dump price. It is only fair to say to the Secretary of State, who can pass it on to his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agricuture, Fisheries and Food, that the world market price for coal was used to close coal mines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could be considered a dump price by South African standards in that the South African Government were dumping coal on the world market. That did not stop the right hon. Gentlemen's Government from closing coal mines and steelworks, and I suspect that it will not stop them from closing farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to say that he needs to reform the CAP in combination with his partners. That will effectively mean accepting the MacSharry proposals. I do not disagree with the starting point of those proposals, but we shall be supporting second farmers—in the sense that people have second homes—in tiny farms in Portugal and Spain to the detriment of our own farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had proposals that defined a small farm as being less than 150 acres, we might be able to use them. But the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would not say that. He wants to be like Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of the whole thing. I suspect that when the Government's reforms are proposed—unfortunately for our farmers, they will probably be very similar to the MacSharry proposals—the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will wash his hands and say, "It's not my fault; it is the fault of all the farmers in Portugal and Spain." The right hon. Gentleman does not give a damn. He and his colleagues did not give a damn when coal mines and steelworks were being closed because of the world market price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative approach should be adopted, but people who believe in the free market would find it
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
distasteful. Opposition Members believe in support for agriculture, and a way of achieving that without giving most of the CAP money to those who run intervention stores or have huge farms would be to pay direct income aids to farmers who need support the most. We would pay them to keep the countryside pleasant and tidy. That would fulfil the objectives of the CAP and broaden them to include qualitative aspects of food production, including the provision of safe, wholesome food at a reasonable cost, the sensitive management of agricultural land and the maintenance of rural communities.

A green premium could be introduced so that farmers received payments for managing their farms according to agreed criteria and were encouraged to use less intensive farming methods. I am sure that my farming constituents, especially those who wish their families to have a future in farming, would welcome the opportunity to farm in such a sustainable way. They would be able to plan for the future. Young people, who keep down the Secretary of State's unemployment figures by working for next to nothing in farming and making rural areas seem as if they do not have an unemployment problem, will have something to look forward to. Farmers will be able to perform their role as producers of better quality food and as custodians of the countryside. That is the future for rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that we have had this debate. People in rural Wales will be glad to hear that Members of Parliament are worried about their future and they can judge for themselves how best that future can be supported. I wish them well, but I expect that matters will get worse before they get better, unless there is a complete change of policy regarding the common agricultural policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The loss of Donald Coleman is shared by every member of the Welsh Grand Committee and throughout the House. I echo the remarks that have been made and I, also, am pleased to have you as Chairman, Mr. Hughes. I was particularly glad that you demonstrated your mettle by putting firmly in his place the hon.

After listening to the hon. Members for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) and for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams), who presented different views on the MacSharry proposals, I am breathless in anticipation of what the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) will put forward as the received wisdom on this matter. I am dying to know whether the hon. Member for Carmarthen will be proved right in saying that he is two years in advance of official Labour party policy—perhaps we shall know that only in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the extra spending that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
morning, which will be welcomed also in Wales as desirable and necessary. My right hon. Friend has obviously fought hard to obtain that extra spending and he deserves our congratulations. He made special reference to forest and woodlands and I hope that that will assist the exciting project for a forest of Cardiff, which envisages a woodland area from Wenvoe, round the top of Cardiff and through my constituency. I look forward to that development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the significance of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) about the transformation of what were once village areas. I always listen with interest to my hon. Friend. This may be one of his last appearances in the Welsh Grand Committee and I do not hesitate to repeat my regret that he will not continue to be in this place, making his individual contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have information that the rest of us do not about an impending general election? I should love it if he could confirm that right now so that we might all go about our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refuse to disclose any information that I might have about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West never ceases to surprise me. It perhaps came as a surprise to many people that after Enoch Powell sought to stand down in February 1974, he was elected as an Ulster Unionist in October 1974. I ought not to be surprised if something similar were to happen with my hon. Friend. When he talked about what had happened in villages, I recognised a similarity to Cardiff North. We refer still to the villages of Llandaff North, Whitchurch, Tongwynlais, Lisvane, Llanishen, St. Mellons and Rhiwbina. There is a Rhiwbina garden village, sometimes called the BBC garden village. We are very much into villages; we in Cardiff, North are natural conservatives in the way in which we maintain those traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it remarkable how the political agenda has changed in the past decade? Conservatives used to be regarded as the natural animals of conservation, with Opposition parties wanting to rip things down and build afresh. Now the radical impetus comes from our side, but it is good to know that some Labour Members share our interest in conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been criticism of the planning appeals system. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) expressed strong reservations about it. I am tempted to digress and say something nice about him. I look forward to my party gaining his seat now that he is standing down, but personally I shall regret not hearing his individual voice in Welsh Grand Committees. After all that he has done in the interest of Welsh nationalism, it would be fitting for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to send him to the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to follow up a question that I raised in Question Time on Monday. What I said was echoed by the hon. Members for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) and for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). There seem to be common sympathies over
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
planning and development across the political divide in the Glamorgan area. I wonder how many hon. Members feel that planning is not an exact science, but a weird and wonderful arrangement. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth reminded us of criticisms that we all make when the Welsh Office allows an appeal on a plan that we passionately believe should not be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, only appeals that are allowed tend to make the news. We hear little or nothing about appeals that the Welsh Office turns down. I continue to be struck that planning is not an exact science. I recall attending lectures by Eurfyl Davies, former planning officer, when I was a councillor in Cardiff. He emphasised the importance of ensuring that all decisions were well founded. He also stressed how costly and injurious it can be when a council fights a case that simply cannot be won. It would be useful to have clearer statistics on how many appeals are allowed and how many turned down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Approaches to planning have changed. We are now more disposed to allow the concept of planning gain to slide through. I recall Councillor David Seligman in Cardiff giving me my first and best lecture on that subject. He argued against the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, then chairman of the planning committee. If I remember correctly, we were talking about the offices of the Department of Social Security in Newport road. Developers applied for a room in a building to be allowed for the specific purpose of community use. Councillor Seligman argued that such planning applications should not be decided on the basis of spurious claims about planning gain but should be looked at solely from the planning perspective. The fact that a developer claims that plans will benefit the community should be regarded as separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the worries expressed by the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan when he spoke about settlements proposed for the Vale. There is a threat of a 600 acre development north of the motorway in my constituency. It seems to have been encouraged by South Glamorgan council. As ever, the proposals are dressed up with pretty features, huge championship golf courses and other delightful aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my office I have a south Wales phone book that is about two years old, with a marvellous photograph on the front. It was taken across Cardiff looking up to Caerphilly mountain. If that development were allowed, with golf courses and stands backed up against the mountain, it would dominate subsequent photographs and change the outlook of that beautiful area. We should resist such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that pressures for more housing continue and that statistics are endlessly advanced. The hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) made a point about circular 30/86. He frequently reminds us about the significance of that circular. Therefore, I was glad when my right hon. Friend recently convened a conference in Cardiff to deal with green belts. That resulted in the Welsh county councils being asked to study closely how that policy might be brought forward. I was glad to receive reassurance from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on Monday that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
district councils and other appropriate bodies would be consulted as well as the county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Council for the Protection of Rural Wales, which has made a significant contributon in encouraging our thinking—it has probably been the loudest and most effective single voice—especially in its report entitled, "How Green was my Valley". However, I am not blind. Green belts will not solve everything. I could easily define where a green ought to be in Cardiff, North. It should be north of the motorway from Tom Gwynlais to St. Mellons. My constituency is almost half rural in nature, with significant rural areas to the south of the M4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already the Land Authority for Wales, in company with the councils, is working hard to develop that area, including a motorway standard link road to join Eastern avenue and the M4. I went to a presentation last week given by the Land Authority for Wales to show how far its plans had progressed. The authority was at pains to say to me that it would confine development there. That is nonsense. Except for a small amount of housing around the BUPA hospital, all the housing in that area from Lisvane to St. Mellons is old and well established. Any major new development will represent an open sesame within a generation, or much sooner, and the whole area between Lisvane and St. Mellons will be concreted over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I remember rightly, I supported that application 10 years ago. That hospital was built adjacent to the large housing developments, called Llanederyn and Pentwyn, and that was not inappropriate. There is a small amount of housing beyond the BUPA hospital, but I want that to be the limit of the development. I do not want the total desecration that the Land Authority for Wales and others are proposing. I shall be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his support in that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crafts industry is significant in Wales. It makes an important contribution to our rural economy and to our economy generally. I do not mean the candyfloss side of the mass-produced gifts and items often found at seaside shops. They are not always of the best quality and, often, they are manufactured outside Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a fine, indigenous crafts industry that needs and deserves to be encouraged. My right hon. Friend will know that his predecessor launched an initiative that will end on 31 March 1991. It is therefore too early to know the result of the evaluation of that initiative or what will follow in its place. I hope that the initiative will be fully evaluated. I perceive difficulties for the crafts industry in its involvement—this is not a criticism—with bodies such as the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. However, I am pleased to see that their chairmen have spent most of the day listening to our proceedings. For the WDA,
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
the crafts industry is much smaller than the other industries that it deals with. The DBRW will know that such craftsmen are not confined solely within rural Wales, which falls within its remit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that I met Mr. Malcolm McIntyre Reed, who is the official of the Welsh Crafts Council in Welshpool. The Welsh Crafts Industry could not have a finer advocate. It has struck me before now that, to help the crafts industry in Wales, we could allow Welshpool to privatise. That is the simple answer because we shall achieve as much as we do now at a much lower cost. Inevitably, we need more than a simple approach to our crafts industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of some of my right hon. Friend's announcements this morning, or otherwise, I look forward to seeing more help being directed towards the crafts industry. It needs it, deserves it and does us proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly. I too, congratulate you, Mr. Hughes, on assuming your post. I should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Coleman. The last conversation of any length that I had with him was when we left the Committee Room, when I dared to criticise Paul Thorburn. If Don were here, he might agree with me that those criticism were well placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that this morning I missed the wellies initiative as, I am told, it is cruelly called. I had other business to attend to, in the Select Committee on Environment. I shall discuss the environment in relation to the future of rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Floor of the House I reminded the Minister of the importance of what remains of the rural area, which the whole of the coalfield once was to people who live in the valleys of south Wales. For a long time it has been our main leisure amenity. Many of us were brought up to value the fingers of land that remain between the valleys, which are beautiful and wild areas. However, they have been terribly desecrated over the years, by quarrying and coal mining, and tips have been dumped on them. In the past decade the people who live in the valleys have treated those areas with greater vigilance. They are now more jealous of what remains than they were previously. We should listen to what those people say and encourage them to play a constructive and active part in preserving and enhancing the land that remains. I am glad that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) mentioned the woodland that stretches along the first line of hills north of Cardiff That woodland is important to his and my constituents, and to many others, including my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies). I, and others, have fought hard to preserve it from quarrying for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is paradoxical that many developments of which we approve for example, widening roads, such as the A470, which is the main link through Wales, or dualling roads—bite into what remains of our rural land. Other examples were mentioned earlier, mainly by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith). We obviously need housing, but the cheapest way to build houses is to do so on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
infill sites rather than to demolish and redevelop derelict urban areas or inner town areas in the valleys. We all too often go for the cheapest option. I do not blame local authorities for doing that, because they are often so strapped for cash that they do not have a choice. However, we have been taking the cheapest option for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In every county in Wales there are new factory sites, business centres and initiative parks—call them what one will. Gwyn Jones from the WDA and I used to call them trading estates in the days when he in north Wales and I in south Wales gambolled freely across the glades and hills of our native land. Since that distant time we have been witnessing the expansion of quarries, and the incursion of housing estates and factory sites into what remains of our countryside. The paradox is difficult to come to terms with and I do not envy anyone who tries to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, North spoke of the difficulties and complexities of planning legislation. He is right. In a previous job, I was involved in opencast coal mining. That is still a difficult issue. I do not often pay him compliments, but the Secretary of State's immediate predecessor was the first Secretary of State to seriously tackle the problem of opencast sites. Although he allowed some to go through, he turned down four large and important projects. That caused much dismay in British Coal and may or may not have contributed to the closure of some deep mines,—I am not sure about that. However, it was a signal that the environment in Wales was being treated seriously; that industry was no longer viewed as the sole God whom we should worship; that there was something else, something dear to the heart of those who live in industrial areas: that their remaining rural land should not be eaten into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can provide confirmation. The new Countryside Council for Wales, which will be established from 1 April this year, will have a remit that extends to the whole of Wales. I know that the chairman is especially anxious to take into account not simply our vast rural areas and landscapes but the valuable rural parts of cities and townships in Wales. I am sure that he will take the matter seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister, I take him seriously and I welcome those initiatives. Perhaps he will treat another matter in the same spirit. There are still many temptations for local authorities to take short cuts in solving some of the most intractable problems that all communities face. One which troubles many people in my constituency is the problem of landfill sites and waste disposal. However well managed a site may be, often the easiest option, and it is almost always the cheapest, is to find adjacent rural land on which to dispose of waste—for example, an old railway cutting. A site at Penrhos near Nantgarw is causing my constituency much trouble. There is a tendency to look for the cheapest option and to prioritise spending on, say, a landfill site rather than on housing, day centres for the elderly, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
If we are serious about protecting what is left of our rural areas, Wales in its entirety must examine carefully each of those small incursions into what is left. If that is done, perhaps we shall not repeat the mistakes that we have made so often in the past—for the sake of jobs, for example, as if that were somehow a holy cause that could not be challenged. In the past, in my and other parties, the notion of challenging jobs was regarded as blasphemy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now face difficult choices, which are not far removed from those earlier decisions. On what do we spend money? How do we balance the needs of our immediate urban areas with those of protecting the neighbouring environment? They are difficult choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this final plea. We must consider rural Wales not simply in the context of farming, the protection of fields, and so on but in the context of the finances that are available for local authorities to enable them to find another method of waste disposal or of gathering stone for the construction of roads. We must carefully examine all the options. The Welsh Office should take a more positive role in that respect and urge local authorities to examine all the options. Often, it is assumed that they will take initiatives of which they are not capable because information is not available on the different ways to dispose of waste—by deepening quarries rather than widening them, for example. It would be good for Wales if there were a system for making available such information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there are two vital matters? First, the Welsh Office should ask local authorities to update the waste disposal plans that were deposited with the Welsh Office as far back as 1985. Secondly, will the Government introduce the section in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 under which licences for landfill are given only to fit and proper persons? That provision—it was an amendment to the Bill—should come into force long before April 1992. A great problem is that between now and the full implementation of that section, large numbers of licensees may apply for licences when the means of stopping such development are far weaker than they will be when the section is implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The Minister would do well to listen to him because he has unrivalled experience of gathering such information and has great insight into the matter of landfill sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last plea is that we consider carefully the possibility of making extra funds available. There is a new EC directive on landfill sites. The EC should spend more money on such activity rather than pour money into protecting what are essentially political voting reservoirs inside the EC. That is what has happened in the past and it is what the MacSharry plan will allow in the future. More money should be available for the sort of project that we are discussing, which is designed to protect and save rural Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what has been said about your elevation to the Chair, Mr. Hughes. That pleasure is tinged with regret at the passing of our friend and colleague, the late Donald Coleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a matter that has already been alluded to by several hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams)—the apparent oversight by the Secretary of State on the matter of rural Wales. He did not make a detailed reference to the likely outcome of the MacSharry proposals and the need at least to reform the CAP in the light of the GATT round of negotiations that remains unresolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that there will be significant changes in the way in which the agricultural policy is run. The principle enunciated by MacSharry, that small farmers should be helped and supported in a way that should be denied to larger farmers, can be agreed. The difficulty, as was shown in the exchanges during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, is the definition of a small farm, as we heard when the hon. Member for Carmarthen was speaking. Perhaps the Minister of State will speak at length on what he sees as the way forward and say how he thinks Wales and its farmers will be helped or supported in any new regime introduced under the CAP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was especially disturbed by a reply at Question Time by the Prime Minister about a fortnight ago. He appeared to give an undertaking that he would ensure that the efficient farmers of Britain were protected under any changes in agriculture policy. Many efficient farmers in the United Kingdom and other European community countries are also involved in polluting our countryside. East Anglia, for example, is experiencing all the problems of the nitrate run-off polluting its water supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not an overall plan to protect efficient British agriculture but a change in the way that we support farmers to ensure a sustainable system of agriculture where land is used to produce crops and market livestock. It should not be undertaken in a way that may be efficient in market terms but which pollutes the countryside and damages it permanently to the detriment of future generations. I hope that the Minister of State will spend a little time considering both the future of the common agricultural policy, which is fundamental to future agriculture in Wales, and the need to ensure that the agriculture that will be developed in Wales and other parts of the Community is sustainable and non-polluting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, even before privatisation of the Welsh Water Authority, great anxiety was expressed about the run-off from silage pits into local streams and the resulting pollution that worked its way into drinking water systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many matters were not covered in the earlier speeches this morning. I know that the Secretary of State was anxious to give the Committee some of the good news which farmers and local authorities in rural areas will welcome. I hope that attention will be paid to these aspects of the rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems with the MacSharry
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
proposals is that they were not worked out; they are more ideas and suggestions than proposals. What we know is that they do not achieve the objectives which we all agree should be part of reforming the CAP. Therefore our first task must be to point out their deficiencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the Minister of State say that. Given that the serious problem of coping with the expense of the common agricultural policy has been with us for most of the past decade, perhaps the Minister of State can say what solutions the British Government will unveil when MacSharry is discussed. Perhaps he will relate them directly to the concept of a sustainable rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the Secretary of State's announcement about the development of a new forestry policy, and especially to the re-afforesting of some of the old industrial valleys of south Wales. I studied the industrialisation of south Wales for O-level history in the dim and distant past, and I seem to recall that George Borrow's works explain that a squirrel could move from one end of the Rhondda valley to the other without having to put its feet on the ground. We may not return to that level of afforestation, but I hope that the schemes that the Secretary of State approves will be mainly—if not completely—for deciduous native trees. We do not want more Christmas tree forestries. They not only disfigure the landscape but add to the problems of acidification in the soil, which works back into our water supplies. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us more about what he expects from the development of the forestry initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend touches on an important point about the community. The Darren valley in my consitituency has a good scheme. However, I grew up in the Rhondda, and the natural playgrounds of our community—the hillsides—have now been destroyed by large-scale uniform forestry development. The destruction of such natural playgrounds is an important issue, as is the problem of acidificiation, which was raised by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say in absolute conclusion that I concur with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith). Countryside and woodland areas are the playgrounds of young people—they certainly were in my short-trouser days. Brecon is a rural town, and I remember the time that we spent during the holidays at the Crwcws, in the bluebell wood and in the Held wood. Let us have more trees, but let us ensure that they are native deciduous varieties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer later to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). Before I do so I shall comment briefly on matters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
affecting my constituency, which were mentioned by two of my neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) referred to the Penrhos tip. A large-scale housing development has been proposed for the north-west face of Caerphilly mountain, which overlooks and extends down to the Penrhos tip. It is filling me, residents, and many local representatives with nightmarish fears about what could happen if the planning application is accepted. I ask the Secretary of State to watch that development closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) about the northward growth of Cardiff. My constituency is directly affected, and the people of Caerphilly regard themselves as the protectors of that ridge and the southern slope. Unless we can resist development spreading north from Cardiff, Caerphilly and Cardiff will become one connurbation, to the detriment of both communities. I hope that if the green belt proposal comes to maturity, it will help secure that buffer between our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) made a thoughtful and comprehensive speech. I draw attention to his comment that agriculture is the bedrock of our rural economy. I am sure that the Secretary of State understands that unless we have a strong, viable and economic agricultural base, no amount of rural initiatives will help. I am glad to see the Secretary of State nodding in acknowledgement. If a multi-party consensus on agriculture policy can be developed, he will find us willing to give what support we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a critical problem at the moment. I was looking a moment ago at figures for farm incomes. Aggregate farm incomes for Wales showed a fall of 23 per cent in 1990, on top of a fall of 18 per cent in 1988. In that two-year period, total farm incomes dropped by 41 per cent. That is a massive cut. On top of that, the forecast by Professor Midmore suggests that 11,000 jobs may be lost in the next two years. Although a consensus may be built, on that point, we have our differences with the Government. I have no doubt that the Government are at least in part responsible for the severe crisis that now faces Welsh agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the central principle of the Government's economic policy has been high interest rates. That, above all else, has sucked away income from all farmers. Secondly, the Government have undermined agriculture—not intentionally, but by cutting support services, such as the research and development services. Over the past two years, the Agricultural Development Advisory Service has lost 200 of its 1,000 staff. The state veterinary service now has 25 per cent fewer people than 10 years ago. I have a copy of 	<i>Farmers' Weekly</i> dated 30 November 1990, which records that
	<br><blockquote><p>"More than 300 scientists and support staff are to be axed by the Agricultural and Food Research council this year."</p></blockquote>
The laboratories at Trawscoed in the constituency of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) are under threat. They will be reduced in size and alternative uses are being sought for the analytical chemistry laboratory. The Bangor
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
veterinary inspection centre is still under threat. They will be reduced in size and alternative uses are being sought for the analytical chemistry laboratory. The Bangor veterinary inspection centre is still under threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that combines to undermine agriculture. Although I do not hold either of the present Ministers culpable, the Government have, to say the least, been sloppy in their handling of a range of food safety matters. Their handling of the salmonella and BSE crises has done much to undermine public confidence in the products of our agriculture industry. It also caused some of the difficulties showed by the livestock sector in the autumn of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, although we have known for the past five or six years of the crisis building up in the common agricultural policy, and despite the criticism that we now get from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about the MacSharry proposals, we have heard nothing about the Government's alternative proposals. It seems a bit rich for the Government to criticise MacSharry, who has put proposals on the table, when they have known about the impending crisis but offered no positive or constructive proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) said that he would be interested to hear the Opposition's policies, and to learn how I reconcile the apparent discrepancies that have emerged between Opposition Members during the debate. There are no discrepancies; our principles are clear, and I shall put them on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, our agriculture has to provide sufficient good quality food from our resources to meet not only our needs but those of any export market that we can develop on the basis of free and open competition. That principle is central to our policy for developing agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must maintain existing production capacity and safeguard it for the future. We do not know what might happen with global warming as a result of the Gulf, or whether there might be another Chernobyl, or what natural environmental disasters might befall us. In the future, we might have to call in that land, that natural resource, for more intensive production. So, however we deal with the present over-production crisis, we must ensure that that can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must ensure that our agricultural system allows us to protect our environment, and that we do not permit the environmental pollution and degradation, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we must maintain the structure of family farms. I am sure that we all agree on that, though there will be different definitions of what is a family farm. The Government do not have a definition—we have, but that is not a matter of party political
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
debate. The farming community is the bedrock of the Welsh language—I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) agrees and, if for no other reason, we must state our commitment to that structure. It is also a valuable and important part of the infrastructure. We cannot lose farmers from the land now and expect them to return in five or 10 years, when we might have to call on their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CAP is the immediate problem. My hon. Friends for Clwyd, South-West, for Carmarthen and for Bridgend have made the Opposition's criticism of it clear. It is worth reasserting that no one benefits from the CAP, because £4 out of every £5 of support does not reach farmers' pockets. For every £1 that does, 80p goes not to Welsh farmers, who need it most, but to the rich agribusinesses of the midlands and east of England. The CAP does not benefit farmers. It certainly does not benefit consumers, because it is a protectionist policy and so we pay more than the world price. It does not benefit the environment or rural communities. It benefits only those who are involved in the CAP's bureaucracy and who store, destroy or export surpluses, which wreck the world market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CAP's central flaw is that it encourages production, but does nothing to guarantee farm incomes. Any reform of the CAP should address that problem. There are already 750,000 tonnes of beef, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of skimmed milk powder and hundreds of thousands of pounds of butter in store, all of which were produced solely because public money is pumped into the CAP. We must devise a structure that allows us to maintain farm incomes without encouraging further production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MacSharry has been much criticised today, but at least he included such principles in his proposals. He has said that the CAP needs to take account of the income problem of family farms in a more systematic and effective manner, and that sufficient numbers of farmers must be kept on the land so as to preserve the natural environment, traditional landscapes and a model agriculture based on the family farm. He also said that there must be recognition of the dual role that the farmer plays in producing and protecting the environment, and that there should be support for those farmers who wish to use less intensive production techniques—for example, to pursue extensification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Direct aid measures should be modulated according to factors such as size, income and regional position. There is no problem—we can all endorse such principles. They are endorsed by the Farmers Union of Wales and the National Farmers Union. We differ from MacSharry on definition, which is why I intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither the Labour party nor the Government will ever endorse proposals that disadvantage British farmers because of the size of our family farms, because of the average size of holdings and because of previous amalgamations and a drive for efficiency that has not yet reached much of Mediterranean Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
On those grounds, we reject the MacSharry proposals, but we endorse the principles on which they are based. What is our way forward? That question was asked by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile). First, we have to ensure that British agriculture is based on good practice and the highest standards. To do that we must reverse the drain of public money into the infrastructure of Welsh farming
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one obvious criticism to be made of the Welsh Office, which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) will want to speak about, is that the Government have done nothing to prepare British agriculture for the challenges of 1992. The livestock areas of Wales must have a slaughter industry that allows us to compete with the rest of Europe, but only three out of 29 abattoirs in Wales meet EC standards. The Welsh Office has done nothing to stimulate the private sector, to put in public money or to encourage co-operative ventures. I compared that with what has happened in Northern Ireland, where the agricultural economy is geared to take advantage of the opportunities of 1992. Twenty seven out of 33 of their abattoirs are up to the EC standard, compared with our three out of 29, and £4.5 million of public money has been pumped in to bring their industry up to scratch during the past five years. It is a source of shame that the Welsh Office has done nothing to equip Welsh farmers to meet those challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that we reach those higher standards. We must reverse the programme that sucks out public funds. We must ensure that our marketing is right. There is another major criticism of the Welsh Office. I see the Minister of State nodding. I know that this is a matter of concern to him. Why did the Government let Welsh Lamb Enterprise go through? They supported the Welsh quality lamb programme, but if they had put a little money into Welsh Lamb Enterprise at the appropriate time, that would have done much to maintain confidence and to develop marketing opportunities for Welsh farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must square the circle of controlling surpluses and maintaining farming on hills. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy sat with me during the Committee stage of what became the Agriculture Act 1986, which introduced the concept of environmentally sensitive areas. That programme must now be expanded. I congratulate the Government on what they have done. They have learnt their lesson, but they must now expand the programme to ensure that every farmer in Wales—for that matter, every farmer in Britain—can enter into a voluntary agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Scotland to protect and care for the environment by undertaking hedgerow maintenance, voluntarily forgoing the use of pesticides and fertilisers, reverting from silage cutting to traditional haymaking, destocking, reducing stocking levels on the uplands and much else that will benefit the environment. We advocate the payment of green premiums to farmers who do such things. It has the magic attraction of squaring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
the circle. It would allow us to maintain farm incomes and encourage a reduction in production while keeping the land in good heart. It would protect the environment yet allow us to reform the common agricultural policy. Finally, it would allow us to resolve the dilemma of GATT. Our proposal for green premiums will be acceptable to the Americans and to the Cairns group, who argue not that farm incomes should be reduced but that production aids should be removed. Our system of green premiums would allow that. It is a reasonable, rational, comprehensive and radical programme of reform, and I know that my colleagues in Wales look forward avidly to the day when my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), the shadow Secretary of State for Wales, is in the Welsh Office and is implementing that programme on behalf of the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be the first person in winding up to welcome you, Mr. Hughes, to the Chair of the Welsh Grand Committee. I share the deep sorrow of everyone here that the loss of our good friend and comrade, Donald Coleman, leads to your presence here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also share the feeling of my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) that we hear the ringing of election bells around the Room today. It seems that Conservative Members consider this to be the last meeting of this Committee before the general election. They should know. We welcome the spirit of greater generosity and co-operation demonstrated by the Secretary of State in his announcement today, although we would have preferred those characteristics to have been demonstrated for the past 12 years by his two predecessors, rather than just for the present moment or even for the next 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate today has demonstrated the depth of knowledge of Labour members of the Committee about rural issues, not least on the part of my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), whose speech was a tour de force and an excellent statement of the agriculture policies of the Labour party. We are fortunate to have him with us today to provide such a well-informed and authoritative contribution to the debate. For that reason, I do not intend to repeat the issues with which he dealt. I shall deal instead with matters raised by other members of the Committee during our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir Anthony Meyer), I welcome the review and the initiative taken by the Secretary of State, even if it takes an impending election to bring about a recognition of the need for a review and for fresh policies to replace those that have failed over the past decade. However, as I am sure the Secretary of State has learnt already, it is always as well to listen to the whole of the welcome from the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West. In the small print of his speech he advised us to look at the small print of the announcement by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question must be answered, and perhaps the Secretary of State will help us. Is it new money that
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
we see before us today, or is it the recycling and double counting of money, as has been mentioned? I note that in his announcement and in his press release today, the Secretary of State referred to a £20 million increase in resources. Is that new, or is it yesterday's dinner heated up and served a second time? In the document on the Government's expenditure plans—the report from the Welsh Office published earlier this month—there is a comment not mentioned by the Secretary of State that 53 per cent of programme expenditure on agriculture is met by receipts from the European Community. How will that percentage change as a result of today's announcement? Is the entire £20 million in addition to the expenditure projected in that report, or is today's announcement in effect a second announcement of figures that are already public knowledge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are so many questions being thrown out. I can tell the hon. Gentleman immediately that it is new money for the rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the question I asked was whether it was new money in addition to the figures published in the Welsh Office projections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Government appear to be rushing to revise figures that were published only this month. That is, perhaps, even more telling than the ringing of bells that we heard earlier in the debate. The Government's projection goes forward to 1993–94. If the Secretary of State is referring to new figures, the figures published earlier this month by the Government have been revised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify this once and for all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must come out of the Minister's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps throwing the question back time and time again.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right, there we are. It is the money that was mentioned at that time, and not fresh money.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is petty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. It is extremely important. Time and again, the Secretary of State, like his two predecessors, refers to the same sum of money being

	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
offered four or five different times, and the people of Wales must be told that the Government are attempting to con us yet again. It is not good enough. I appreciate the Secretary of State's desperation, unease and lack of confidence in his Ministers to reply to the debate, but we will not accept his telling us that a sum of money was announed a few days ago and then his suggestion that it is fresh money being announced today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right; it is not fresh money—it has just been allocated differently. The Secretary of State is confirming what we said at the beginning of the debate. My hon. Friend's generosity was greater than was justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the announcement simply means that some of the money that has been taken from Wales over many years is being put back. The Secretary of State announced in his press release that there would be an increase of £6 million in expenditure for Tai Cymru. That represents 150 houses only, so it is not a massive amount when we consider the whole of Wales. Let us think of the millions of pounds that have been taken away from those in the greatest need in Wales by reductions in housing expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, Dr. Gwyn Jones, and the Secretary of State refer to the schemes and projects being the result of action plans by the communities that will benefit from the partnership between the WDA and local authorities. The Secretary of State said that he will publish his objectives in the summer following consultation with local authorities. I am sure that the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) that local authorities will respond imaginatively will happen. Local authorities have responded positively at every opportunity, even though they might have been suspicious about the way in which new schemes have been introduced. I hope that the Secretary of State recognises such positive responses. Ofter we hear about schemes that have come from the work of local authorities being described as if those were solely Welsh Office initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities in Wales have the burden of the poll tax to bear, and all communities face the mysteries of the relief levels that were announced the other week. That mystery has deepened following the announcement of the levels for different communities. However, poll tax levels and support are unrealistic in terms of finance that is made available to local authorities in Wales. Welsh local authorities manage to be within 5.7 per cent of their standard spending assessments. In 1981–82, the Government met more than 73 per cent of local authority expenditure, but for 1991–92, that will have fallen to about 58 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that local authorities are being asked to respond positively to the Secretary of State's initiatives, and I am sure that they will. I am told that the claim that the community charge at standard spending of £228 is a reduction of £4 from
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
this year's actual figure is like subtracting apples from oranges in the hope of getting pomegranates. A degree of realism is needed when considering local authority finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West referred to the Government's confusion in their agriculture policy. My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly offered much more clarity on the subject. His tongue-in-cheek expression of admiration for the Secretary of State for speeding—not the Secretary of State for Wales, I hasten to add—was both stylish and damning. It is right to say that high interest rates are not the only problems for farming communities, but the burden of interest rates is heavy for younger farmers trying to establish themselves and develop their business. Such rates eat into the narrow profit margins to an unacceptable, sometimes impossible, extent. My hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) made a stinging condemnation of the failures of agricultural policy in its Welsh, United Kingdom, European and worldwide aspects. The loss of small farms and the effect of that on communities and the language is terrible in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's pressure on local authorities has undermined authorities' policy on smallholdings. I have heard that message in Cowbridge, South Glamorgan, with my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith), in Llangefni and in other parts of Wales. Local authorities need help to create policies to aid younger farmers start and develop in their chosen profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) gave me a note saying that he could not be here this evening. The Liberal Democrats assumed that the Committee would meet only in the morning. The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery referred to low farm incomes and the growing impatience of banks. That reflects the pressures of the recession and high interest rates on farmers as on other businesses in the rural economy and in towns. The Labour party's critique of the Government's economic policy has been proved right. My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), the Leader of the Opposition, was right to press for a cut in interest rates. They were cut by only 0.5 per cent—too little and too late for many rural businesses. Greater cuts are needed soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carmarthen referred to the problem of small farms, which are difficult to define. European farms are much smaller—microfarms in comparison with those of the United Kingdom and even those of Wales. We must defend our small farms—that is the prime responsibility of agriculture Ministers in the Welsh Office. British farms are in danger of drifting yet further in character from those in Europe. Massive agribusiness leaves no room for small farms and family businesses. As my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen rightly underlined, Wales is disadvantaged by those factors. The Secretary of State must intervene to improve matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) referred in the House last week to the problem of the EC spending £24 billion on the CAP, the bulk of which goes on the storage and disposal of surpluses. He argued that if that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
money was to be spent on the CAP, it should be spent, as should our taxes, on supporting small communities and environmental protection, not on the disposal of food mountains. My hon. Friend noted that many farmers in the less favoured areas and uplands do not fit the criteria of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the future of farming. My hon. Friend argued that there was room for traditional small farms. I hope that the Secretary of State for Wales will concur with my hon. Friend rather than with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly and the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery were right to emphasise the importance of abattoirs in the food chain. The problem is not only slaughter, but food hygiene and public safety and their place in the farming industry. My hon. Friends the Members for South Shields (Dr. Clark) and for Caerphilly published in the autumn the Labour party's detailed proposals on such issues in a document entitled, "Slaughterhouse Secrets". My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly was right to criticise the Welsh Office for its failure to tackle the scandal of having only three abattoirs up to EC standards. We have had time enough to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974, as a new member of one of the new local authorities, I was involved in a working party that dealt with the problems of abattoirs. At virtually all of our meetings we discussed the ways in which Welsh abattoirs would have to respond to the requirements of Europe. That was 16 years ago, so my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly is right to castigate the Welsh Office for not doing enough to resolve the problem. The Secretary of State should bring together industry representatives in Wales as soon as possible to tackle the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, North referred to appeals on planning. I am glad to have his support. I wish that the Welsh Office would show more respect for local views on appeal. The problem is not to do with the number of appeals that have been granted but with the fact that many big appeals have been granted in the past 12 years. That laxity is based on an obsession with unrestrained free market forces and has created worrying pressures on the rural areas around our towns and cities. Those pressures have not been exerted overnight, but are the product of planning consents that have led to a drought in land for development in some places. Greater respect for local authorities in the past would have ameliorated the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, North also referred to Rhiwbina Garden Village, which was built in what was then a rural area as part of a good socialist initiative on behalf of local railwaymen. It is an excellent example of collective co-operation, and the exact opposite of the Thatcherite mode of Conservatism of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I must mention the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and the hon. Member in short trousers—my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). They spoke about the need for strong policies on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
green belt and rural areas immediately around our towns. That concept must be developed positively and not simply as a defensive tactic against development. The former Countryside Commission's work was devoted to the idea of a positive, living, community-based countryside. That is what we want around our towns and in our valleys. The countryside should not be a museum but a living environment supporting living communities. I also pay tribute to the Council for the Protection of Rural Wales for its work in trying to unite protection for our rural heritage with the need to preserve its vitality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State was asked for his assessment of the impact of the current recession on business and employment in Wales. He said that the Government's policy of fighting inflation was working throughout the Welsh economy. We should remember the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside, who said that farm incomes have fallen by 23 per cent. That fall has been felt most deeply in rural Wales, which depends on the livestock sector. There must be realism as well as headlines in the attempt to secure the future of all parts of rural Wales. The next Labour Government will work to that end with both realism and idealism. Such a Government will be good news for the people of Wales. To judge from what has been said by Conservative Members today, that Labour Government may well come sooner than had been thought and may even be in power before this Welsh Grand Committee meets again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hughes, and in passing wish to pay tribute to your predecessor. I was very fond of the late hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Coleman), who always reminded me of the marvellous schoolmaster in Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village":
	<br><blockquote><p>"A man severe he was, and stern to view;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I knew him well, and every truant knew;"—</p></blockquote>
I very often felt like one of those pupils—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The day's disasters in his morning face;".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the late Donald Coleman would take offence at that small tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my right hon. Friend's initiative has been so warmly welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I have been present at the launch of several initiatives in my time, but I do not recollect any of them being as universally welcome as this one, and I am sure that that will be the response in all parts of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been clear for some time that the rural economy of Wales was going through a difficult time, in spite of the considerable progress that has been made during the last decade. It is because we appreciated these difficulties that we chose rural Wales as the subject of today's debate. We have been working on this initiative for several months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We not only wanted to show what has and is being done, to help the rural areas overcome their problems; we also wanted to show our willingness to do more. Indeed, I believe that we have. My right hon. Friend's announcement this morning of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
additional £20 million to be spent by the agencies and the local authorities will put new heart into the rural communities and assure them that the Government are doing their utmost to safeguard their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many references in this debate to the plight of agriculture. The facts about the decline in farm incomes have been rehearsed time and again. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that the Government have increased the hill livestock compensatory allowance to assist farming. All in all, about £100 million a year is provided in subsidies to Welsh farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is a very telling fact that, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said in the debate last Thursday,
	<br><blockquote><p>"more than 80 per cent. of spending on agriculture comes from decisions made in Brussels".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 February 1991; Vol. 185, c.1018.]</p></blockquote>
Reform of the CAP is therefore central to the future of agriculture. Some of Mr. MacSharry's ideas discriminate against the United Kingdom and must be resisted. Neither the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) nor anyone else contradicted that. We are not taking the defeatist line apparently advocated by the Liberal Democrats. There must be a realistic prospect of a successful future for Welsh farming, under whatever proposals are eventually agreed upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Caerphilly that it is becoming increasingly clear that Welsh agriculture must become more market-oriented, and the importance of Welsh Food Promotions cannot be over-stressed. We all wish Alun Evans success in his chairmanship of that body. The development of an effective strategy to promote and market Welsh food products is vital to the future success of farming in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) spoke about extending environmentally sensitive areas and the greening of HLCAs, which already have a green tint about them. Several hon. Members commented on the abattoir provision in Wales in respect of the EC hygiene standards due to come into effect after 1992. I do not dispute the figures quoted this morning by the Opposition Members, but they did not say that these three EC approved abattoirs already account for about 45 per cent. of the throughput in Wales. A further four abattoirs are currently taking positive steps to upgrade and we expect six more to do so before 1993. Those 13 EC abattoirs would, between them, account for about 85 per cent of the throughput and would undoubtedly have the capacity to increase throughputs above that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) spoke about housing. In recent years we have made available additional allocations and credit approvals totalling some £2.8 million to rural district councils with severe second homes problems, to enable them to buy dwellings for rent or re-sale or to purchase land for housing development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £3 million additional funding announced today replaces the second homes allocation of earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
years. Authorities will be able to make a case for second homes purchase, but the emphasis will be on more innovative and cost-effective approaches to rural needs. Detailed terms will be available to authorities later this week. We shall soon issue planning advice on land for low-cost housing in rural areas, following our consultation last year. Last year Housing for Wales launched a rural housing initiative to assist local people, especially young people, to find suitable homes which they can afford in their own communities. That initiative is being run on a pilot basis in 31 villages across rural Wales, the majority of homes being provided on share ownership terms with a pre-emption right to return the home eventually to the relevant housing association. The capital used in each project can be recycled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities can establish low-cost home ownership schemes which allow the home and the subsidy to be recycled for second and subsequent purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) referred to rail and road traffic in rural Wales. The Government's general view is that public transport services should be provided on a commercial basis, but we realise that in rural and other areas that is not always possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The infrastructure costs of rural railway lines in Wales are supported by the public sector obligation grant. Using that support, British Rail has plans to bring more modern rolling stock on to rural lines in Wales. That will include the new 158 units on services between Aberystwyth and Shrewsbury and on west Wales lines; and single car 153 units on the central Wales line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I too regret the withdrawal of the London-Aberystwyth Cambrian coast express, but the use of 158 units and good cross platform connections into the London services at Shrewsbury should provide a high quality of service with an improved journey time overall. British Rail is reviewing inter-city and regional rail services for North Wales and will announce its plans shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next three years, expenditure on trunk roads of about £550 million is planned, around 60 per cent. of which will directly benefit rural areas. Recent scheme completions include the A48 Nanty-Caws to Coed Hirion and A487 Cardigan Bypass. The bypass for Llanidloes will open shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Updated information on schemes in the forward programme will be included in a supplement to "Roads in Wales", which we plan to publish next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On north-south routes, the upgrading of the whole of the A483 or A470 routes to dual-carriageway standard cannot be justified in economic or environmental terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979, more than £50 million has been spent on improvements to the A483, with six schemes under construction or planned, at a cost of over £40 million; more than £100 million has been spent on improvements to the A470 and expenditure on 26 schemes in progress or planned totals a further £100 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport grant assistance is being given in the 1991–92 settlement for the A497 Abererch to

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
Llanystumdwy scheme in Gwynedd. Powys county council is working on route improvement proposals for the A44 which will be considered for transport grant in due course. Similarly, Dyfed has been invited to consider the scope for using new route improvement criteria to develop proposals for improving road communication north of Carmarthen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we all acknowledge the importance of tourism to the Welsh economy. I know that the Wales Tourist Board is working closely with the British Travel Authority and the travel trade on its overseas
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
marketing and exhibition campaign and is even more determined this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WTB has stationed an officer in the United States to encourage holidays in Wales. I know that that officer has a busy programme of meetings and presentations with the travel trade in north America. I wish him success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
