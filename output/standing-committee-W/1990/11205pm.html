	<time>Wednesday 5 December 1990</time>

	<p>[MR. DONALD COLEMAN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN WALES</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made and Question proposed (this day),</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of education and training in Wales.—[	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.07 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning I was informing Welsh Office Ministers why so many good, experienced teachers are applying for early retirement. That is worrying, because many are conscientious and experienced teachers. Many who teach children under seven question the need for compulsory testing at seven and publishing the results. That will create problems and confusion in primary schools. I hope that Ministers will review that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is crisis in many classrooms. We desperately need a new approach that enhances the value of education and of teachers, provides adequate resources for books and buildings, and gives all those involved in education a decent environment in which to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools should be encouraged to develop vocational skills at an earlier age. Too often children are not given proper advice on the choice of subjects to guide them through their careers. It is the height of folly to ask a child of 13 or 14 to make subject choices without giving that child proper advice and guidance on career prospects. That is one reason why we have a mismatch of skills. Too often children leave school with high educational attainment but with little or no idea of career prospects. We should restructure our career service and enhance the value of careers teachers by giving them proper training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service in Wales is grossly underfunded and barely exists in some areas. Co-ordination between the career service, local authorities, the training agency, the training and enterprise councils, industry and trade unions must be improved. Careers officers and teachers in our schools are immensely important and should be brought into contact with younger children. That would not hinder the broad-based education that children need, but would allow them to make more effective choices. The Government say that they are about creating choice, but more advice at an earlier age would give children real choice in career prospects. It would also widen their opportunities when they move on to further education, job training or apprenticeships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to echo some of what was said this morning about the need to provide Welsh language education throughout Wales. I am sure both the Secretary of State and the Minister of State will know about the efforts being made in West Glamorgan, South Glamorgan and Gwent,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
and about the cross-border relationships between Powys and Dyfed. Parents' aspirations for their children should be met by all the local education authorities in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a recent sitting of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, I invited the Secretary of State to consider whether it would be appropriate to transfer responsibility for training to the Welsh Office. The problem is that the Welsh Office has complete responsibility for education in Wales, but only partial responsibility for training. If a coordinated approach involving education, the careers service and training is to be a success, it makes sense that the responsibility for planning should be made at an all-Wales level. I was surprised that the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) was not prepared to commit the Labour party to that concept. It is not—or should not be—a party matter. The development of a Welsh identity in education and training crosses party lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will consider the need to adopt an integrated strategy for Wales. All hon. Members will wish only the best for the TECs that are up and running in many parts of Wales, but they face a tremendous task and we should not shrink from acknowledging the difficulties that will arise when they are fully operational. One problem, especially in rural areas, will be to ensure that the industrial input into the TECs remains, in accordance with the Government's intention, at the highest possible level. The Government have striven to ensure that that is achieved, but the problem is less acute now, when TECs are in their early stages, than it will be when they have been in operation for two or three years. Will that commitment continue into the future? I doubt whether it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is too exacting to ask leading industrialists in rural areas to devote time to the programme for years. I fear that the Government may be absolving themselves of responsibility for training and transferring it to industry. The problem in rural areas is that industrialists do not have the breadth of experience in training that many of their counterparts in urban areas have. Perhaps we should reconsider the matter in 18 months or two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister of State deal with my intervention this morning during the Secretary of State's speech on funding for education in industry initiatives in rural areas? I have often raised the matter with the Minister of State, not only in Committee but elsewhere. He is also aware of my pleading in favour of funding for a compact scheme in Gwynedd, and he will recall my plea in the January sitting of the Committee. On that occasion the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Ynys Môn said about compacts. We are working on them, and I am sure that we shall be making an announcement in the not-too-distant future."—[	<i>Official Report, Welsh Grand Committee,</i> 10 January 1990; c. 64.]</p></blockquote>
He made an announcement, which we welcome, but it was disappointing because it did not include Gwynedd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be another announcement shortly. As the Minister of State knows, the local education authority in Gwynedd has worked hard to build links between industry and education. Industry has been encouraged to participate in the initiatives and there are now plans for a new education-business partnership, which may attract funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am about to give the hon. Gentleman the kind of assurance that he seeks. It will be for the training and enterprise councils to take forward the proposals for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
compacts in future, funded out of the budget for youth training. I understand that in the north-west there is an intention to work closely with the local education authority to develop arrangements for business compacts and partnerships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention. That information will be welcomed in Gwynedd, where there is great interest in developing such links, getting a seal of approval for existing links, and obtaining funding through the TEC. We shall have to discuss the future development of the scheme with the officials of the north-west Wales training and enterprise council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to self-employment and unemployment in Gwynedd. As the Minister knows, there is an excellent record of business start-ups in Gwynedd. A high percentage of people there are setting up in business on their own. However, the cut in funding for employment training that was announced by the Department of Employment in April this year has led employment training managers to question the Government's commmitment to the service that they provide. The reason given for the cut was the drop in the number of long-term unemployed, and the fact that there were other initiatives in which the Government were interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow on from the point made by the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), several training managers are now worried because they are not sure whether funding will be available for them to continue their initiatives over the next few years. Will the Minister clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people, especially in colleges of further education which are now involved in business enterprise programmes, have put to me the need for greater flexibility in such programmes. In rural areas a scheme with 10 people on it may be viable. In urban areas one can easily find 20 people to participate, but in rural areas it is difficult to get classes of more than 10 people in higher education colleges. The programme should be made more flexible so that people in rural areas will not miss the training that is necessary for them to become self-employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In rural areas, the enterprise allowance scheme has caused problems that affect women who want to return to employment, especially women who want to set up in business on their own. The Minister of State knows that for a person to qualify for enterprise allowance he or she has to be in receipt of benefit. The problem for many women is that they are not in receipt of benefit, and although many women have the skills necessary to start up in business on their own, they therefore do not qualify for enterprise allowance. Many women would welcome financial assistance when setting up in business. I hope that the Government can therefore amend the scheme to ensure that benefit is available for women to develop their business skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the co-ordinated approach to training and education in Wales. For many years Welsh education authorities have been in the vanguard of education. My own county, Anglesey, began comprehensive education, and its education authority has been involved in many initiatives. We have much to contribute to education and training, and I should like to see the Welsh Office taking responsibility for that in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.22 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist). As a Minister, he was a listener, amenable to argument, pragmatic in his approach and not superglued to an archaic ideology. Above all, he cared. I should not like to be accused of using the royal "we", but perhaps I may say on behalf of the Committee that we shall sorely miss him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister was absolutely right to say that there should be no recriminations after the leadership election. However, I do not see how he expects his wise injunction to be observed when he has sacked a widely-respected Minister and a political moderate who happened to be a prominent supporter of my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine). The Prime Minister has replaced my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central with somebody from the far right who just happened to support him. But then it is a funny old world isn't it? As regards education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>HMS</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman not to submit himself to the blandishments of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you for your protection, Mr. Coleman. I had no intention of yielding to their temptation. They have always envied me for my succinctness, brevity and moderation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past year I have visited 12 schools in my constituency, and many other Committee members have frequently visited schools. I have the highest respect for the teaching profession. The teachers whom I have met—I visit every class and try to speak to every pupil in the schools that I visit, which is not always easy in our open plan primary schools—are, by and large, committed, dedicated and worthy of our respect. I also believe that they are underpaid. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) in calling for a further examination of incentive allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trend of Government education policy has been towards decentralisation, by bringing decisions closer to schools, classrooms and the teaching profession, and away from bureaucrats—I should never dare say away from Ministers, or some of them, anyway. I wholeheartedly support that commendable trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will reassure us that, whatever is being said in the Chamber at the moment, the Government will not remove the cost of education from local government to the centre and place it on the taxpayer for the purpose of reforming the poll tax. That is not the right approach. I hope that today's newspaper reports are correct and that the poll tax will be abolished. I do not believe that it can be reformed. It is time to admit that we made a mistake. We shall earn the electorate's respect if we admit that and try to correct it. Politicians do not earn the electorate's respect by pretending that they did not make a mistake and by undertaking eternal reviews. Tinkering and refining is not enough and it should be abolished. But the poll tax cannot be reformed by transferring the cost of education to the centre.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that surplus places is an intractable problem which gives rise to tremendous administrative difficulties. I agree a little with the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), who highlighted some of the difficulties. We must confront the problem. It is absurd if there are thousands of surplus places in the Principality. Although Clwyd county council has attempted to reduce them, it has not yet gone far enough. But Gwynedd, for example, is wasting money. One might just as well take £5 notes to the tune of £2 million or £3 million and burn them in front of shire hall. It is money down the drain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour-controlled Clwyd county council is only too well aware that the problem is difficult to tackle, especially after its unfortunate experience over the proposed closure of a Argoed school in my constituency. I hope that what happened in Clwyd is not an example of the Labour party's approach to democracy; the chairman of the education committee, Labour councillor Clive Wilkinson, announced his decision about surplus school places to the press before he told his own committee. That is the vey negation of democracy and is no way to run a council. It is precisely what eastern Europe—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It would never happen in the Welsh Office—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am speechless that this outrage has been perpetrated in Committee. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister of State would never do that. It is important that such matters are discussed in committee at the county council. Indeed, it might have saved Labour from getting so much scrambled egg on its face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of a school such as Argoed, which has 32 surplus places—although Clwyd's figures were so inaccurate, but that was the number according to the report on which it based its decision—cannot be proposed when a neighbouring school had 585 surplus places and Mold Alun in my constituency had 330 surplus places. It makes no sense whatever, especially for a school with such a good academic record. Perhaps the Labour county council made that extraordinary decision simply because it did not want to propose the closure of two schools in the constituency of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). It may have felt that one was enough and that two might finish him off—which might have been to our advantage, but never mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South-west)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that was not a sensible move. I sympathise with the county council, and with whoever is in charge of it, in the difficulty of dealing with surplus places. Virtually any county councillor who is threatened with the closure of a school in his ward will no doubt see the electoral guillotine descending upon his neck and will do his utmost to save that school, however irrational his arguments. Does the hon. Gentleman wish me to give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, the hon. Gentleman is waiting for me to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was jumping up and down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may repeat what I said about surplus places. We are really talking about under-financing, not surplus places. Clwyd has a pupil-teacher ratio of about 17:1 in the secondary sector, which is more than double that in schools such as Eton and Harrow
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
which, I assume, the hon Gentleman thinks are good schools. If we had a pupil-teacher ration the same as that in independent schools on the whole, there would be no surplus places in Clwyd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the state school which I attended—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) would have been wonderful here 30 years ago, but the Conservative party has now moved on. I do not know anything about Eton and Harrow, but the hon. Gentleman obviously does and I hope that he drags himself away from them occasionally to visit his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was at primary school the classes that I was in had between 35 and 39 pupils, which was a real problem. The rural urban conflict in my constituency is similar to that in the constituency of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West. I am not against the closure of all rural schools, but it is not in the educational interests of children to be subjected to vertical streaming and not to have in their classes contemporaries with whom they can mix socially. We have a real problem with surplus places but they are not just a financial problem any more than are rural schools. They are also an educational and social problem. We must face that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for kids, wherever possible, to be educated with children of their own age and to know sufficient children of their own age to develop socially. That is just as important for their education as teaching in the classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not solve the problems of rural schools we shall be faced with the problem of very large classes in urban primaries. I have made that point in Committee many times. I never quote the pupil-teacher ratio because it is the most misleading figure on earth. All teachers who administrate, or whatever, are included in that figure, which is 18.8 per pupil. I never know which bit 0.8 is of a pupil in a class. Does one teacher get 0.8 and another 0.2 of a pupil?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a problem in big classes in our urban primaries because the pupils at the top of the class will get the teacher's attention as will the pupils at the bottom, but the majority of pupils in the broad band in the middle do not. I am certainly in favour of reducing class sizes wherever possible and we must do so, but the question of reducing class sizes, particularly in urban primaries, is tied up with surplus places and rural schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point on which I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) is that, even if we save a lot from surplus places, we shall still have a problem with the backlog of school building maintenance. I am getting to the stage—perhaps I am ceasing to be partisan in my old age—at which I do not care who is responsible for the problem. We must deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a tremendously bad inheritance from the 1960s and I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West because I do not think that only a few of our schools are shabby. Many are, and that is mainly due to architecture. Flat roofs should never have been allowed because they are the curse of school buildings. I go to relatively new schools and also to Victorian and Edwardian ones. Often, Victorian and Edwardian schools are standing up better to climatic conditions than those build in the 1960s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the point to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the Select Committee that education authorities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
that indulged in a big school-building spree—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] May I have the attention of hon. Members because I am making a point about which we may all agree? Education authorities that indulged in a school-building spree in the 1960s and 1970s now have a tremendous problem—Clwyd is an example. They now have debt loan repayment problems for those school buildings, which forms a large proportion of their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission compares like authorities with like authorities, but Clwyd spends a far bigger proportion of its education budget on debt loan repayments than other education authorities in its group, and that is a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capitation is also a problem because inflation has raised the cost of books, paper, school materials and equipment much higher than the retail price index. For example, Ysgol Maes Garmon, a Welsh school in my constituency which I visited recently, has 746 pupils and £21,000 per capitation. There is a slight disagreement because the Welsh Office says that the figure is £33,000 for 1990–91, and I have not yet resolved the difference, although it is quite large. Even if the figure is £33,000, that is too low. The history department has a total capitation for new books for the financial year of only £450.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careers advice is an important aspect of education, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State emphasised earlier when he was speaking of school-industry links. Yet the careers officer in Ysgol Maes Garmon has a total capitation of £84.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also resent strongly the amount that has to be paid in examination fees. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has given me the figure of £24,000, in addition to the £33,000 capitation fee. Something must be wrong somewhere; examination fees are too high, and capitation too low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From visiting schools, I have learnt that morale in the profession is low. It is better than it was, for reasons that I shall give the Committee shortly. Many of our reforms are welcome, but objections are made to the pace of their introduction. The burden of the reforms falling on teachers and the pace at which they are being introduced are causing the problem. Many teachers feel that the national curriculum is too detailed, even though it represents what is basically good practice. They find it difficult to absorb all that churned out. I have with me the national curriculum on history. It is double its actual size because half of it is in Welsh, but in any event it is an enormous document. It is ridiculous to expect history teachers to absorb all this information. I have also the national curriculum on Welsh and the file is as thick as the history national curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read sections of them. I am a layman, not a teacher, but teachers have complained to me that the documents are far too detailed, although much of the national curriculum is basically good practice.

Ironically, education in primary schools is becoming more structured, with a great deal more teaching to test and to the curriculum just at the time when secondary education, as a result of the introduction of the GCSE, is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
becoming less rigid and more informal. That, I think, is a backward step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter from some 20 teachers—a quarter from my own constituency—in primary schools in Clwyd, as other hon. Members from the county may have done. They make the same point. I can assure the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) that they have read the documents, and that is their view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths (Brigend)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is pursuing an interesting point. As a graduate in history, I have paid some attention to the history publication, and have asked teachers in primary schools what they feel about it. Their general view, with which I agree, is that unless the teacher is already an expert, he or she cannot easily fit the advice and guidance in the history curriculum into its context. What is really needed is a range of textbooks aimed at children at that level, to make sense of what is in the history curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also am a graduate in history, and I took particular interest in the document. I take the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be distracted by points raised by the hon. Member for Meironnydd Nant Conwy, although I would not call them irrelevant. What I am describing is the pace of reform and the amount of material that we are churning out and laying on teachers—in addition to everything else. We are introducing at the same time the national curriculum, the standard assessment tasks, local financial management and local management of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer), when he commended my right hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor)—the former Secretary of State for Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He did not last long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Raffan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he did not, but he was moving in the right direction while he was there, and I hope that will be continued by his successor, who is on the right—with a small "r"—wing of the party. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, he used to be a moderate, but who knows these days? I am still one—I think that we all are on the Government Benches today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessments are too rigid and we are in danger of teaching to the tests, which are too structured. We are going in the wrong direction. Teachers say that it would be far fairer and more accurate to have teacher assessment than SATs. They believe that HMI inspections chivvy up schools and have more effect in motivating and stimulating teachers. I visited a school in my constituency shortly after it had had an HMI inspection, which it had found to be an extremely valuable exercise. The teachers had been on edge for a week, but the inspection had a dramatic effect on teaching methods, the curriculum and so on. They thought that an inspection was a better way to raise teaching standards than SATs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am basically in favour of LMS and local finance management because I believe that they will bring decision-making far closer—to the schools and classrooms. A distinguished primary head in my constituency, Mr. Closs Parry in a school in Bagillt now describes himself as the director of education for Bagillt as, by so doing, he can apportion a budget for his school. He welcomes the measure. Most of the headmasters with whom I have discussed the matter strongly welcome LMS and LFM. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
more innovative and experienced ones are seeking expert financial advice to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said to my hon. Friend the Minister, there is a problem with LMS and LFM and the difficulties with pupil-led funding, when such funding is according to the age and number of pupils. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was right to say that there is not such a big turnover in teachers. However, when there is a stable, experienced staff at higher salary levels, there is a potential problem with LMS and LFM. I know that the Government do not want to change their financing methods from pupil-led funding to teacher-led funding, but there is a problem. I am not satisfied with my hon. Friend's answers so far. He has tried to be helpful and has offered to examine individual cases, but there will be many of those. The Government must consider the problem or headmasters will be in a terrible predicament. They will be unable to wait for the natural wastage of teachers retiring, but will have to consider dispensing with senior experienced staff or face problems with their budgets. The Welsh Office is aware of that problem and is sympathetic to it, but we need more than a promise to deal with individual cases. The problem must be solved across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Government's reforms are going in the right direction. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West was right when he used the phrase "practical improvements". We need a more pragmatic approach. I hope that that will not mean that I shall suffer the same fate as my right hon. Friend the Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen) when I say that we need a period of consolidation. Radicalism can be exhausting after a while. Primary and secondary schools must be allowed to absorb the reforms and implement them fully. I always say what I believe, and I have decided that that is worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms need time to be implemented fully and effectively. I know that we can look to my right hon. Friend to ensure that Forsythism—if that is the phrase—will not be introduced in Wales. My right hon. Friend will have the complete support of Back Bench Members, who will be ably and effectively led by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, the chairman of the Welsh Conservative Back Benchers. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was in the early hours of St. David's day 1974 that the Welsh people realised that they had elected four new Members to the House of Commons. Three of those new hon. Members were the hon. Members for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) and myself. We are very good Members of Parliament, but unfortunately we have been on the Back Benches ever since. But our day may come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other new hon. Member, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), was, about three and a half years ago, duly promoted to high office in the Welsh Office. During those years, and in the years before that, I always found him a sincere and true parliamentary colleague. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
thank him on behalf of the three of us who entered the House with him in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the new Minister to his new post. He represents part of Pembrokeshire, so he is my neighbour. M I am a little older than he, I give him a piece of advice. I do not think that his record on Welsh language issues is worth recording. My advice to him is, "Please mend your ways, and remember that you now have a great deal of responsibility to the people of Wales. Please look after our language, culture, health and other interests. Accept the challenge of office with grace."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is a high priority in my constituency. We have a proud record of achievement throughout the full range of educational institutions, from schools to colleges and university colleges. It could be said that the movement for bilingual education began in Cardiganshire, for in Aberystwyth the first Welsh primary school was established at Ysgol yr Urdd back in the 1940s. It set an example that was followed by other education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we have several bilingual secondary schools, and the demand for them is growing throughout Wales. Liberal Democrats want an expansion of bilingual education, extended support for the teaching of Welsh, and the establishment of bilingual schools wherever the demand is currently not being met. I hope that the Minister will ensure that adequate resources are made available in the near future for those parts of Wales that are keen to set up Welsh medium education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also proud that we have the first university college in Wales, at Aberystwyth, built by the pennies of our forefathers. That was followed by others, including, eventually, St. David's college, Lampeter, in my constituency. Aberystwyth is rightly regarded as the foremost centre of Welsh education and culture, and we could justly describe the national library of Wales as a jewel in the crown—a wonderful repository of Welsh culture and scholarship. In my view, there is no point in having strong education at lower level unless there are excellent standards at the top. The national library plays an important part in providing those standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the Minister of State on Monday announce an increase in grant aid for the library, but I should be grateful for further assurances that sufficient support will be provided for the library's adventurous and exciting policies for exploiting its current resources, and for the acquisition of new material. Will the Minister of State confirm that the library will be able to retain the same high standards of scholarship and professional expertise that it currently enjoys?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—I said that I would be brief—will the Minister give an assurance that he will make adequate provision to ensure that children in Wales will be truly bilingual by the turn of the century? I ask the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), the shadow spokesman, to give a similar assurance that, if his party is elected to office, it will bring forward proposals to establish a Welsh Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened with interest to right hon. and hon. Members on both sides. Who knows, if we all got together, those of us who are fluent Welsh speakers will have the opportunity in the near future to express our views in Welsh. It would be wonderful if that could be achieved during the next four or five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John P. Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate. I congratulate those responsible for choosing the subject of our discussions; education and training are important. Of those two topics, I intend to concentrate on training. Education has been dealt with thoroughly and accurately by my right hon. and hon. Friends. My hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) made excellent speeches, as did the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before I speak about training, I wish to add to the long list of tributes paid to the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), who unfortunately was sacked this week. The hon. Gentleman comes from the same tradition of Welsh Tory politics as did my predecessor, the late Sir Raymond Gower. He holds moderate views, he is a pragmatic politician and he continues to put people before philosophical or ideological convictions. That tradition runs throughout Welsh politics. It is sad for us all that he is no longer on the Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for speaking about training in the context of the needs of my constituents. In recent months it has become an important issue, although I suspect that there are lessons to be learned by all of us because of the problems that we have recently faced. A few short weeks ago, I had the chance to hold a training seminar in Barry, but I had only six days in which to organise it. I decided to take the opportunity, and, in those six days, about 50 delegates arranged to attend. The respresented mainly employers, but traders, local authorities and other representatives from across the community came to the seminar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seminar was arranged because I had received representations from several employers about their worries at not being able to give existing employees the skills training that they required to carry out their jobs properly. Local training courses were being closed—I know of one such course in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member of Caerphilly (Mr. Davies)—and people had to travel far and wide to get their basic training. Employers told me that they could not continue if training were not provided to meet the required skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the position in the present climate. Since I have been the Member of Parliament for the Vale of Glamorgan, there has been massive investment in the area—investment in the Ford plants, the announcement of investment by British Airways in Cardiff airport, the Bosch investment in Miskin, and the Cabot chemicals investment in Barry. All, bar the Ford investment, bring in to the area in excess of 2,500 jobs. The success of attracting the Ford investment may pave the way for future investment in the next generation of engines and bring more jobs to the area. Therefore, before the effects of such investments were felt, there was already some consideration of providing the necessary skills training required by local employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A successful seminar drew attention to many problems attached to training. The hon. Member for Ynys Mon (Mr. Jones) referred to the necessity of providing proper careers education in schools. The issue goes further than that. In the seminar, local employers made the point that we do not give sufficient careers advice to school children
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
and do not tell them enough about the industries in which they could work. It is difficult for the chemical industry or the shipping industry in my constituency to recruit youngsters when they are not interested in manufacturing jobs, no matter how skilled or well-paid they are, because they do not know anything about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what is happening, despite 10 or 11 years of an Administration which boasted that it created an enterprise culture. However, there is no enterprise culture in schools to encourage recruitment into wealth-creating occupations. A senior manager in the chemical industry suggested that we should provide videos to show youngsters in schools the opportunities that they could have in such occupations. I had the privilege of sharing in the launch of an excellent video produced recently by the British Shippers Council, which aimed to display the need for expanding that industry and to encourage people to come into it. The video is particularly apposite because the industry is currently experiencing a recruitment problem—it cannot get skilled officers into skilled engineering grades. It would be a good idea to extend the example of the video to the chemical, manufacturing and other wealth-creating industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not the first time that the problem of the shortage in the engineering sector has been referred to. We are aware of it and the places that we are providing for students of engineering are not being filled. The engineering sector agrees that that is partly because of the lack of first-class presentation to young people on the part of the engineering industry itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept part of the Minister of State's observation. More could be done. Some places are not filled because they are not attractive to youngsters coming through the school system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil anf Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Their values are different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. Values have changed in the past 10 years. Such people want to work in the City and make lots of money without producing or creating anything. There has been a shift in values—not necessarily a negative one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local college, which was recently given an excellent report by HMI, has experienced substantial expansion in subjects such as leisure industry, hairdressing and catering. We held a training seminar at that college because of its excellent facilities. However, there has also been a rundown of the engineering workshops and in the teaching of traditional skills, which far from no longer being needed, are most desperately required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investment on our area has created a huge demand in our labour market for semi and highly-skilled precision engineering workers. Employers in my constituency fear several dangers if we do not meet the training challenge presdented by that welcome investment. There may be overheating in the local labour market that could push up the price of labour beyond the reach of local employers. There could be poaching as employers try to avoid losing their skilled labour to Bosch or British Airways. There are 900 civilian engineers working at the nearby RAF camp at St. Athan. British Airways could offer an extra £1,000 a year and poach labour. That is the danger if we do not face the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
The third possible scenario is of the importation of labour to fill skilled occupations while there are local people who are unemployed or misplaced in their jobs because we have not trained those people. That causes much anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The training and enterprise council that is being created to cover my area may have difficulty meeting the challenge posed by the investment. I shall meet the council on Friday to discuss that matter but I am not sure that it will be able to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past 10 years, the Government have made a terrible mistake by failing to invest in proper training, which does not include the community programme, the one-year and two-year youth training schemes, the job training scheme or employment or job training, or whatever it is called. The Government have confused work experience, which was what most of those so-called initiatives provided, with skill training. The success of the YTS have come where it has been merged with traditional apprenticeship schemes. The classic example of that is the construction industry training board's YTS. That is the biggest training agency in the country and it has been very successful. Its success has been due to managing to intergrate the new training initiative with traditional apprenticeships. I am a former apprentice and I benefit substantially from the traditional skilled training that I received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solely local emphasis of the TEC means that it will pick up feedback about the short-term training needs of local employers and the labour market. However, if that is not balanced with longer-term, basic skills training, similar to the traditional apprenticeship scheme, we shall not have the skilled people that we need to compete with the Germans and Japanese. Multi-skilling and re-skilling are genuine needs of local industry, but they must be in addition to basic three or four-year skills training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who have not benefitted from apprenticeships ignore what is contained in three and four-year training programmes. One does not learn just how to be a joiner—as I did, although I am not sure how good I was—but how to work safely and tidily and how to solve problems. That provision with a substantial educational input, especially in first and second years, is a far better base for re-skilling or re-training. There must be national co-ordination between the TECs and the industry training board. I like the suggestion of the hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr Jones) about co-ordination on a Welsh basis—because we need to provide a uiniform, basic skills training. The CITB and training agencies will be contractors to the TEC, but I am worried that the relationship is a bit blurred. There is a danger, especially as there is not a balance on the membership of the TECs, that employers will be able accurately to reflect their short-term needs and those of the labour markets, but that they will not underastand the need for longer-term training programmes for future jobs, and for investment in future training. I should like that to be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the TEC initiative to the attention of anybody who doubts that the Government have made mistakes. Each TEC is a private trust—I sense that the motives for that are more ideological than practical—but the principle behind the TEC is intervention. It is to draw up a plan for training in the area, to intervene in the labour market and identify its needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
Many Opposition Members have argued for many years that we need such an interventionist initiative so that the labour market responds effectively and quickly to the demands of employers on training and investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hunt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the important thing about the initiative for training and enterprise councils is that it is private-sector led?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Private-sector funded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that. I am not sure that that aspect of it is essential. I believe in the success of partnership. I should like to see greater representation from our public educational institutions and local authorities. One of the remits of the TEC is to serve the community generally, and I should like to see the community better represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get bogged down in such details because I accept the principle. It is a de facto recognition by the Government that they should be doing something. That is ironic when we consider—and this is astounding to someone who has any interest on labour economics—that since October 1982, there has been no occupational analysis of the unemployed register. There has been no collection or collation of statistics referring to the occupational skills that unemployed people have or the occupation that they have come from. When does the Minister of State expect that absurd situation to change? It will make the job of the TECs much more difficult. How can they liaise with the local departments of employment to find out about training needs and the places and jobs that are to be filled when they do not even know the skills of the people concerned?

With the prospect of rising unemployment as a result of the recession—although I hope that the investment that has been announced for my constituency will mean that we may be able to ride the recession—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will welcome my right hon.

That investment amounts to £5·4 million in 1991–92 and £2·1 million in 1992–93. I am sure that the hon.

That money will go some way to meeting the training requirement and labour market problems in my area. However, I am talking about the ability of the TECs to discover the pool of skills that exists in the labour market. For the past eight years, as a result of their bizarre reliance on the free market—whatever that means exactly—and by not requiring that information to be registered in job centres, the Government have refused to keep a record of what occupations unemployed people have previously had and, therefore, their occupational skills. With the prospect of rising unemployment before us, that needs to be dealt with straight away, especially if the TECs are to act effectively and efficiently and to liaise with the Department of

When does the Minister expect a decision to be taken to enable the Department of Employment to instruct the unemployment benefit offices or other agency to find out what skills exist among unemployed people?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have only a little time left, I shall try to make my points speedily. However, I should like to range over the whole education sector, from nursery to higher education provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has a very good record in the provision of nursery education, largely thanks to Labour authorities. Although the driving force of providing such education has been a priority, difficulties with education expenditure over the past decade, have meant that the rate of growth has slowed down, even though it was a Conservative Secretary of State for Education and Science and former Prime Minister who wanted to double the numbers in nursery education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Welsh Office to look again at means of not just expanding the direct local authority provision but of helping the voluntary sector, the parent teacher associations and ysgol feithrin, to provide more of this necessary nursery education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred to visits they have made to schools in the past year. I was prompted first to make a study of this by parent governors who complained to me that they were completely disillusioned about their role because they were no longer looking primarily at the provision of educational excellence in the school their children attended but at finding the money to carry on with what was being done in the school. I set about talking to head teachers and teachers, and I visited schools. Since September, I have visited 15 schools providing education for children—in the three to 11 age range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that teachers are dedicated to providing a high standard of teaching and making sure that their pupils do their best, but are under extreme pressure. As a result of a lack of resources, time and ancillary help, they are being asked to do too much, too quickly in the classrooms. They have lately been showered with praise but financially, looking at the teaching profession over the past couple of decades, they are no better off and in many cases are worse off. Even the last settlement, because it was staged, does not truly reflect the increases they need because of the huge inflation rate that we are experiencing under the Government. Ultimately, the stress on teachers to provide a good service is too great. They need not only better pay but more ancillary help, as that will give them more time to look at what is happening in their classes and to assess their children properly with a tested scheme of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcomed the previous Secretary of State's announcement that the pilot schemes had proved disastrous and that far too much had been expected of pupils and teachers, but the scheme that he announced has not yet been tested and will be used in schools in the next couple of years. There is great concern in schools about making sure that the basic skills such as reading and mathematics are given sufficient time within a broad
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
timetable. A little more flexibility is needed on the fringes of the national curriculum. Some heads admitted frankly that they were taking a Nelson's eye view of the whole of the curriculum to ensure that the basic skills were being taught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Minister in his opening speech and my hon. Friend the Minister for Pontypridd (Dr Howells) referred to the Polytechnic of Wales. I hope that the Welsh Office will take a truly Welsh view of the whole of higher education and teacher training when considering its future. That sector in Wales is just about the same size as a major urban English polytechnic. There is a strong case for considering a federal structure in polytechnic education, absorbing the institutes of higher education—such as the Welsh College of Music and Drama, and the Welsh College of Agriculture—thereby creating something with an all-Wales dimension. If there is flexibility between institutions, a great impact will be made in increasing the numbers of those in higher education in Wales. Which is the desired target of both the Government and the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard welcome announcements about the supply of money for the training of teachers in the Welsh language, but the Welsh Office must also concentrate on the provision of literature in Welsh, particularly at secondary level. I find that at junior level a fair amount of literature flows through the schools, and is available for children to read. However, in secondary schools there is still a great dearth of literature, and that must be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, children with special needs, and disabled children have a statutory right to education up to the age of 19. Many of them, however tell me that after that age, unless they have skills that can take them through to further education, or further training if they are lucky, they are left out in the cold. We must give them a statutory right to special education that is not limited by age, but provided when there is further education from which such young people can benefit. At present, it is available only by grace and favour. The Welsh Office cannot act alone there, but I hope that it will take the problems to the Department of Education and Science and that some method is found to allow those with special needs who are over 19 to continue with their education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, would like to take up the Secretary of State's invitation to discuss the structure of higher education, partly because—with the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W Roberts)—I was a member of the Committee examining the Education Reform Act 1988, in which we discussed a seperate higher education structure for Wales. That Act enabled a structure to be established, continuing the role of the Wales advisory board, although no final decision was taken about the actual form it was to take. that is where we find ourselves now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the studies that have been made by consultants—the Price Waterhouse report and so on, We should take advantage of this opportunity to make a decision that will benefit us beyond the year 2000. I am not advertising myself, but I speak as a former full-time and part-time employee of the University of Wales and of other parts of the higher education sector in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the university did nor operate as a federal university. Only recently, thanks to the initiative of Lord Cledwyn of Penrhose, the great predecessor of my hon. Friend the Mayor for Ynys Môn (Mr Jones) and the

activity of the deputy chancellor, we now have the University of Wales operating, probably for the first time, with some form of federal structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been visited upon us partly through the University Grants Committee and its successor body, the University Funding Council. We now have this strong federal structure within the university sector, operating in a coherent way. We also have the Welsh sub-committee of the UFC, established in the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This points to the need for a parallel structure in the rest of the higher education sector. I also believe that we need a cross-binary integration of both structures. That is nothing new. My first speech on education in the House, some 15 or 16 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has passed like a dream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a complaint, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, whatever he said. My argument is that this is the time for the Minister of State to crown his great career as administrator of Welsh education with this final innovation, bringing together the university, the polytechnic and higher education sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not make sense to consider integration with an effective federal system for university on the one hand and the creation of a national polytechnic, taking in the rest of higher education, on the other—that seems to be the proposal by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education—without taking that one step further. It makes as much sense to link laterally education centres and institutions in Wales as it does to create two parallel structures of higher education. Linking the universities and higher education centres would be the appropriate solution for the needs of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the mistakes of the past. When we were re-organising the structure of higher education—especially colleges of education—some of us, mistakenly, campaigned to keep the Bangor Normal college, as it then was, out of the clutches of the university. I understand that the university is about to purchase one of the ex-buildings of Bangor Normal. Had we had lateral intergration within the whole of north Wales, centred around Bangor, but also taking in the important institute in Clwyd, which is now reoragnising itself because of the tertiary re-organisation in Clwyd, that would have served the cause of post-graduate and undergraduate teacher training. There is always a danger of duplication of courses and lack of effective use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now is the time to consider what is happening in the north and in Swansea, Cardiff, Lampeter, Aberystwyth and so on. Why not take a leap of faith across the binary line to have a system that will run effectively? That requires certain changes. The Secretary of State must take full responsibility for higher education, including universities, from the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom the responsiblity for university and higher education is not planned coherently. In Northern Ireland, the responsibility for university education lies with the Secretary of State, but in Scotland and Wales it does not. A cross-binary mechanism was nearly established in Scotland, but that did not come off. We now have the opportunity to do that in Wales and I hope that the Secretary of State will consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
If it is not possible to take the great step of making the honourable Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) the Minster for the University of Wales, along with his other duties, let us at least have a planning mechanism between the UFC sub-committee for Wales and the federal structure of the university, so that trans-binery or cross-binary higher education in Wales will be planned together, covering courses, funding and validation. We shall then have a model that will be the envy of other higher education institutions in the UK and the rest of Europe, It will be more like the North American model of higher education with similar access at all levels in to the structure. I should want Coleg Harlech to be included in that structure, I worked there for three years—my only proper job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like a guarantee for the future of the institution of Coleg Harlech. It is historically an important institution in the growth of access into higher education in Wales. I know the Minister agrees with me about that. It should have a place within an amended and improved structure of further and higher education for those over the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a role for the college. The Welsh Office is examining it to assess its future contribution. The college should be included within an integrated structure of higher education in Wales, and should be funded as an access institution into higher education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This wide-ranging debate has dealt with one of the most significant subjects that we can discuss in this Committee. No other region or nation in Great Britain puts greater emphasis upon the education of young people; we believe that they are our future. The debate has revealed that we spend less than our major competitors upon education. Because of that, and for other reasons we are failing the children of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere can that be seen more clearly than in the fabric of our buildings. My hon. Friends the Members for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) referred to the fact that the buildings of our schools in Wales are in a terrible state. In 1987, for example, her Majesty's inspectors said that many schools in Wales had dismal and depressing surroundings. Two years later they went further. The 1989 report referred to many poor laboratories and workshops with inadequate provision in technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the greatest problems faced by Wales is that there are 1,800 secondary and primary schools that were built before the first world war. In mid-Glamorgan alone 200 primary schools were built before 1917. The £25 million that mid-Glamorgan county council is calling for as the basis from which those schools can be put right, is simply a fraction of the amount of capital about which the Secretary of State boasted this morning to the Committee and to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more is needed to right the schools, especially those in our valley communities. The Welsh Office
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
Ministers talk about the importance of the valleys initiative, but a significant or meaningful reference to education or to improving the fabric of our schools in the south Wales valleys is lacking in that valleys programme. Matters are made worse by the fact that the new governing bodies of our schools in Wales have to cope with LMS, and deal with the fabric of the schools from both the outside and inside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, some weeks ago, I asked the Minister of State for Wales for the views of teachers elsewhere in Wales about the local management of schools, he told me that many people have welcomed delegated budgeting. Some may have done so, but all the school governing bodies and headteachers that I talked to have said that the LMS system as it now stands is woefully inadequate and is causing many problems for our schools up and down the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it means anything, LMS means less money for schools. Every school, whether it be a primary or a secondary school, has had to cope with a smaller budget as a direct result of LMS. When that is combined with surplus places in schools, schools like Cwmcarn, say that they want to opt out, not because they agree with opting out, but because they want to ensure the school's survival. The greatest danger to the survival of our schools. certainly to primary schools in urban and rural areas, is not the problem of surplus places but that of LMS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the so-called reforms brought in under the Education Reform Act 1988 are deeply unwelcome in the Principality. My hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said that we are not against the national curriculum, but that the curriculum as it now stands is far too rigid and is underresourced. In 1989, Her Majesty's inspectorate talked of "much uncertainty" in our schools because of the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teaching morale in the Principality is at its lowest for decades. Much of that can be blamed on the introduction of the national curriculum, where there is too much bureaucracy and too little money. We need more resources to put that curriculum into effect. For instance, Welsh has never been taught as a major subject in Gwent. Plainly, if it is to be taught properly, a great deal of extra money will have to be given by the Welsh Office to the Gwent county council. As the council has received nothing like the amount needed, inevitably the teaching of other subjects will decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem is one of funding. The HMI report stated that primary schools look directly to parents for finance. The Secretary of State said this morning that education in Wales has had more money, but he failed to tell the Committee that local authorities in Wales have been robbed of at least £1 billion in rate support grant during the past decade, which should have gone into the coffers of our county councils and local authorities. For instance, the report stated that in North Powys the governors ended up decreasing the quality of education because they are not given enough money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is as simple as that in all counties. My hon. Friends the Members for Pontypridd and for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) referred to one small but significant example—the decline in the teaching of instrumental music in school by peripatetic teachers. The Welsh College of Music and Drama, the school governors and the Welsh Musical
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
Advisors Association all say that the Government's so-called reforms have meant that in the land of music we have had to cut the teaching of instruments. Yet at the same time, the Government plan to spend no less than £2,300 each on 700 assisted places in the Principality. That is contradictory. What are the Government trying to escape from? Why should they want people to go on assisted schemes? If our schools were properly funded, there would be no necessity for assisted places. The only new idea on funding for education that the Government can dream up is to take the financing of education away form our local authorities to get out of the poll tax mess. That is hardly an original idea—it started in 1958—but the Government are panicking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Members have referred to the lack of funding for training. The training agency budget has been cut from £10 million to £5 million. There has been a 40 per cent. cut in the youth training scheme and a 15 per cent. cut in employment training. In the county of Gwent only last week the new training and enterprise council announced a cut in its plans even before it starts next year. The Government have taken away the necessary money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an admirable speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to the waste of talent during the past decade caused by the inadequate and unsatisfactory training schemes that have been forced upon the young people of Wales. Where have all the apprentices gone? My hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) referred to apprentices and in an intervention, the Minister talked of the money that the Government were spending on engineering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The apprenticeship schools throughout the manufacturing areas of south and north Wales have disappeared overnight. That is a tragedy for Wales. Great Britain trains fewer people than do Taiwan or South Korea. One quarter of those in employment training never find a full-time job. That is the measure of success of the schemes that have been brought into Wales over the past decade. We have had schemes, more schemes and nothing but schemes. The purpose of such schemes is to massage the unemployment figures to ensure that they do not reflect the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have plans for training. We intend to provide skills training for Wales, to make the TECs more broadly based and to ensure that there are high-quality traineeships for up to four years for all those leaving school at the age of 16. At the other end of the scale, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brigend said, we intend to ensure that there is proper provision for nursery education for all who require it. We shall do other things as well. I have noticed that the Minister has had in front of him all day the Labour party's new document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am finding out. We shall raise standards through an independent education standards council, overhaul teacher training, set up a general teachers' council and have a fresh look at local management of schools and the national curriculum. What is wrong with that? That is a good place to start. We shall also jettison the cranky idea of saying that our schools are businesses. That is absolute nonesense. The notion of linking education with the free market has disappeared in Japan, the United States and Germany. Only in this

country do we have such dotty ideas, which have come not from education bodies, but from institutes such as the Institute of Economic Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education in Wales has been made into a jungle in which schools are set against schools and communities set against communities. That is not right. We do not want Wales to be used, as it has been in the past decade, as a guinea pig for the cranky and dotty education ideas coming from the right wing of the Conservative party. With the new Under-Secretary of State in place, we know that there will be no change in the current ideology. However, that does not matter as it is too late anyway. It is too late for the Conservatives to change. Time has run out. Education and training in Britain and in Wales will certainly be a major issue at the general election. It is equally certain that the Conservative party is doomed in the Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.24 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate and have covered much ground. I am grateful, as I am sure is my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, for the expression of views on a variety of themes, such as higher education, with which I may not be able to deal adequately in my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office is uniquely placed in that my right hon. Friend has responsibility for education provided by local authorities and a shared responsibility for training. No one doubts that education and training are vital to the future prosperity of Wales. We are united on that. There were some early references in the debate to other European countries, notably Germany and France. Although it is only a small consolation, those countries are not without their problems. France, for example, is suffering from serious teacher shortages in maths, the physical sciences, English and even French. I can tell the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) that the latest figures show that the United Kingdom spends more in current expenditure per pupil than does France and that the purchasing power of teachers' salaries is higher here than over there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Monday of this week, the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), the Leader of the Opposition, launched a new document about raising standards in Britain's schools entitled "Aiming High". That was the document whose title the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) could not recall. That is far more than the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) achieved—I was surprised that he did not refer to it during his speech this morning. He did not mention it once—perhaps because there was nothing in the document that was not contained in another document, called "Looking to the Future", except for the pretty pictures. "Looking to the Future" was severely criticised by some of the teachers' unions and by all and sundry involved in education. We may return to "Aiming High" before the end of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to underline again the range and breadth of the improvements that we have made in both education and training. As my right hon. Friend has already made clear, we have pursued the philosophy of choice for parents and students. That is important in itself, but it also provides an incentive to improve standards of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also pursued the theme of quality. The introduction of the national curriculum has been a milestone. I served on the Committee that considered the Education Reform Act 1988 and as I recall no Opposition Members voted against the introduction of the national
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
curriculum. They were all for it. Now they are somewhat critical. The national curriculum will be acknowledged as a major step forward by future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must all be concerned when children achieve less than they could. The national curriculum will undoubtedly raise standards across the board and ensure that pupils receive the broad and balanced education that they need. We have struck a proper balance between a common England and Wales curriculum and one that reflects the needs and heritage of Wales. Through our support for Welsh in the national curriculum, we have taken the biggest single step that could be taken to safeguard the future of the language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Opposition did not vote against the principle of the national curriculum. He should recall that we had much to say about the rigidities of the scheme that was introduced. We disagreed with the Government about flexibility for teachers within the broad base of the national curriculum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agrees that there were no votes against the national curriculum. We are as anxious as the hon. Gentleman to secure as much flexibility as possible. Certain guidelines had to be laid down. Some of the things that are being done in connection with the national curriculum are being done for the first time ever. Some facts have hardly been mentioned in this debate and it is high time that they were. The number of young people enjoying further education has increased by 25 per cent. over the last decade—from 25,000 to 31,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the number of young people in higher education is even more spectacular—a 74 per cent. increase since 1980—from 9,500 to 16,500. It is that theme that the Opposition are taking up; they are following our spectacularly successful policy of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the welcome increase in the number of students to initial teacher training courses in England and Wales this autumn. That is 9·4 per cent. up on last year. In Wales, the numbers recruited in the public sector colleges was up by 12·1 per cent. Recruitment in the university sector was sadly down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) raised the question of foreign language teachers. I am pleased to say that the introduction of a bursary for trainee language teachers this year has resulted in an increase in recruitment of 30 per cent. in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also proud of the progress that we have made with schemes for the local management of schools. In the past, many schools have been severely penalised because historic budgeting has tended to reflect numbers and seniority of teachers rather than the needs of pupils. Local management of schools will rectify that by ensuring a fairer distribution of the available resources. All schools are now funded according to a formula and a school's budget is determined largely by the number and ages of its pupils. Many schools can now decide for themselves how best to use the money in their budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the worries that have been expressed about the LMS arrangements and I shall comment on two of them. The change of emphasis in the way that schools are to be funded has raised understandable anxieties in the teaching profession, and there has been lengthy debate about whether schools' salaries should be treated in a different way from other schools' costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
I remain convinced that, as teaching costs are by far the largest component of educational spending, it follows that the formula for a school's budget must reflect the average cost of employing teachers, with individual schools being charged the actual cost of the teachers whom they employ. We are prepared to look sympathetically at the problems of schools facing difficulties in the trasition from actual to average salaries, and the schemes that we have approved in Wales reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee, and especially my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Raffan), that the schemes have been in operation for only eight months. If serious problems emerge they can be taken into account in our review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to small rural schools. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey) has been most vociferous in his anxiety and I understand his position. As I have already said, we are committed to pupil-led funding, because it ensures schools will be funded objectively on the basis of their task—educating children. Within the overall objectives prescribed by LMS, we must keep the position of a large number of small schools in Wales, especially those which are sutuated in our rural areas, in the forefront of our minds, Those schools need not face any greater threat from LMS than they did from previous funding methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is ample scope for authorities to protect small schools through their formula. They can take account of the higher unit costs of delivering the curriculum in small schools and the disproportionately high salary costs in primary schools with fewer than 300 pupils. As before, it is for the LEAs to determine the extent to which they should continue to augment the resources of their smaller schools, so that they may continue to provide the excellent service to the local communities that they have provided in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor also raised the issue of surplus places in rural schools. I assure him that our main concern is with the position in the urban areas where real savings are to be made and educational gain achieved by tackling the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All schools are now funded according to a formula arrived at by the local education authority. We stipulated that at least 75 per cent. of the resources allocated to schools must be related to the numbers and ages of pupils. However, each authority—I think that the hon. Member for Pontyridd (Dr. Howells) will be interested in this—was required to draw up its own formula. If that has given rise to the difficulties over funding which were referred to by the hon. Member for Pontyridd, my right hon. Friend is ready to consider proposals for authorities to amend their schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are continuing to review the implementation of local management and we are prepared to give sympathetic consideration to amendments to schemes. We also need to consider the next steps to maintain the momentum of delegation. To that end, we will be issuing later this month a draft circular to local education authorities and other interested bodies. The circular will, among other things, consult on proposals for increasing the proportion of resources available for schools to mange themselves. It will contain our proposals on extending local management schools to special schools. We will also put forward proposals for the treatment of those budget heads that result in distortion and diversity between local educatin
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
authorities. Our recommendations will, no doubt, stimulate much discussion, and I look forward to receiving and considering authorities' views on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to today's announcement on projects or regional or national importance. I am also happy to announce that as part of today's captial allocations, the Polytechnic of Wales has been allocated nearly £600,000 under the PRNI arrangements. That sum is to fund technology improvements at the polytechnic, some of them in the computer department, which has already been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) and the hon. Member for Pontypridd referred to the training of young people with special needs. Each training and enterprise council is required to set out, as part of its business plan, how it intends to provide for people with disabilities. Those plans will form the basis of its contract. In addition, performance-related funding criteria will provide a positive incentive to TECs to meet certain specified objectives, which will indlude targets for participation by people with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are continuing to encourage close links between TECs and local voluntary organisations which, working in partnership, will be able to identify and provide for the needs of those members of the community with special needs. We are also taking steps to ensure that people with a mental handicap can lead as normal a life as possible within the community. Under the mental health strategy, the Welsh Office is providing funds to enable local authorities to improve the quality of training given to adults through innovative training schemes, and specialist employment agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gave that item priority before talking about training in more general terms. There have been major reforms in the training sector: the training and enterprise network is already in place, well in advance of the original schedule. As part of a fundamental review of the careers service, we are considering how that will relate to the training and enterprise councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is it the Welsh Office or the Department of Employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department of Employment is effectively responsible in consultation with us. We were responsible for setting up the TECs in Wales and my right hon. Friend and I are in constant touch with the chairmen of those TECs that are in the development stage and those that are coming on stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spurred on by the TEC movement, employers are investing more in training than ever before. They are investing some £20 billion in Great Britain as a whole. It is not just the Department of Employment that lies behind the TECs—the idea is very much to involve the private sector and get employers to contribute. That, I am glad to say, they happily do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity has been given to employers to demonstrate further their commitment to training through the new standard "Investors in People"; a rising proportion of young people are undertaking further education and training beyond the age of 16 as I mentioned earlier. There is a greater understanding between the education system and industry through TVEI, work-related further education and the wealth of education-business links that now exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1990-1991V006P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
There is also commitment to establish a comprehensive system of vocational qualifications and to introduce records of achievement that young people can take from school through initial training and on to work. Expenditure on training in Wales will continue to be substantial. It will be enhanced considerable by the TECs which, I am sure, will not only be successful in raising the amount of money which businesses themselves put into training but in securing better value for money for the programmes that they run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Funding for training and enterprise is over £91·5 million this year. The comabined budget for youth training and employment training is over £76 million. These are substantial sums of money, particularly when set against the fact that unemployment in Wales has tumbled by some 84,000 over the last four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the start of employment training in September 1988, over 51,000 people in Wales have benefited from its provisions. At ony one time around 13,000 people are being trained. A particular feature of employment training is the help that it offers the disadvantaged, to whom I gave priority in my earlier remarks. Twenty nine per cent. of those who start on the programme in Great Britain have been unemployed for more than two years; 12 per cent. have a long term health problem or disability; three per cent. are from ethnic minorities and 16 per cent. have literacy or numeracy difficulties. There is therefore no question but that the scheme is dealing with these problem areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about some fairly small percentages. We shall certainly look into the matter that the hon. Gentleman has drawn to our attention. I deny his

implication. I gave high priority to those with special needs before I embarked on my comments on training in general. I have given due emphasis to it.

A measure of the success of the programme is the fact that two out of five leavers find jobs or enter further education or training within three months. These results surpass any previous programme for the long-term unemployed.

The trainees clearly found the scheme interesting and it has improved their work skills. In addition, recent figures show that 67 per cent. of trainees in Wales obtained a vocational qualification while on employment training.

I began by talking about "Aiming High". One aims high only when the target is far away and in danger of being missed. Of the five targets referred to in the document, only two are thought to be achievable within five years; the rest stretch over a period of 20 years.

In that document—evidently, I have to tell the Opposition what is in it—the Labour party is said to have been
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the forefront of education improvements for fifty years".</p></blockquote>
If the Opposition make that claim, they should accept their share of responsibility. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Torfaen to complain about the state of the buildings of our schools. I, too, am well aware of the state of our buildings. When I visit a school, the first question I ask is when it was built. As often as not, it was built during the period of a Labour Government. It was they who build flat roofed schools which are leaking and where the plaster is falling off the walls, and now they are attacking us. The people who built those schools had no respect for our citizens or our culture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
