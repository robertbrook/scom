	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of rural Wales.—[	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>The Welsh Econony</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. The title of the debate that was originally requested was the recession in Wales. It has been changed to the economy of Wales. Will any member of the Committee who catches your eye be able to go into graphic detail about the current recession in Wales? Only you, Mr. Hughes, can tell us and I hope that your guidance will be that, in view of the fact that the agreed title for the debate was the recession in Wales, you will allow us to emphasise that matter, as distinct from the economy in a broader sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject is a broad one, but the matter referred to the Committee by the House is that of the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i></p>
	<p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee has considered the matter of the Welsh economy.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hunt)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity that the subject provides because the Welsh economy now has a resilience and a strength that Opposition Members would have given their eye teeth to have when they were in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After recent difficulties, business in the Principality is beginning to show signs of renewed optimism. I noted in a press report only last week that the Institute of Directors in Wales had published a business survey showing that 10 per cent more company's directors had expressed optimism about future prospects than was the case six months ago. There has been a decline of 25 per cent in those who say that they are now less optimistic about their prospects. Of the companies that responded to the survey, 40 per cent said that they expect their total employment to increase over the next year. The average expectation of employment was for an increase of 2.1 per cent over that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That renewed optimism, as reported by the Institute of Directors, builds on the survey that the Confederation of British Industry conducted in April, which carried the same message. However, Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
Members should not believe that those facts give rise to Government complacency about the present difficulties. Equally, it is not an occasion to publicise remarks that Opposition Members may make that seek to stress, for political reasons, that the picture is one of doom and gloom. Clearly that is not the position in Wales—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I know that Opposition Members do not like listening to a series of bull points about the Welsh economy, but having excited the Committee's expectation, I shall outline them anyway. Long-term unemployment, for example, has fallen from 78,000 to under 26,000 since January 1986, a reduction of 67 per cent. That is much greater than the fall for the UK. There are now almost 100,000 more people in employment that there were before the 1983 general election. There are almost 200,000 more civilians in employment. Encouragingly, a large part of that growth was in self-employment, which has increased by about 50 per cent since December 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent paper on employment trends in the British engineering industry, produced by the Engineering Industry Training Board, shows that employment in the Welsh engineering sector has increased by almost 14.5 per cent since 1984. It is the only region in the United Kingdom to have experienced growth in that sector over that period. Employment in the Welsh electronics industry has increased by almost 90 per cent since 1978, compared with a fall in Great Britain of around 11 per cent. Employment of professional engineers, scientists and technologists has trebled over that period. The employment of professional engineers, scientists and technologists in the Welsh motor vehicles sector increased 548 per cent; in 1978, there were 44 such senior personnel and there are now 285. In the remainder of the country, there has been a decline of 1 per cent in employment in that sector. The people of Wales know that they have high quality work force and they are prepared to get on with the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman knows, I always welcome improvements in commerce and industry in Wales, and I especially applaud the work done by the Development Board of Rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the right hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that he will consider the whole of the Welsh economy in his speech, including what is still the major Welsh industry—agriculture? Does he recognise that my constituency has had a record unemployment rise in the past 12 months because of the disastrous decline in agriculture during that period? What steps he will take to replace what appears to be an inevitable loss of jobs in the Welsh agricultural industry? What percentage of the jobs that will be lost in agriculture over the next five years or so does he expect to be replaced by jobs in manufacturing industry and commerce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, at the previous meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee—I cannot recall whether the hon. and learned Gentleman caught the eye of the Chairman during the debate—we had the opportunity of debating rural Wales and we spent some time considering the key industry of agriculture. I welcome the opportunity to make the comments about agriculture that I had planned to make later in my speech. I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
that a healthy agricultural industry is vital to the future economic, social and environmental health of Wales. In my visits to farms and in my meetings with farmers—the National Farmers Union, the Farming Union of Wales and other representative groups—I have always stressed the importance of that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the advent of 1992, the Government are determined to take every opportunity to continue the efficient ingress of agriculture into other markets. First, we want to ensure not only that we continue to be efficient farmers, but that any reform of the common agricultural policy is not seen as militating against efficiency in the agricultural industry in Europe. We want to ensure that we market our produce as efficently as possible. As the hon. and learned Gentleman will know, I have launched a marketing initiative and a new company to co-ordinate all the bodies that were previously marketing our produce. I hope that the marketing of Welsh agriculture will take and important move forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise two, points. The right hon. Gentleman made general comments about high-quality jobs in engineering, electronics, motor vehicles and so on. Will he be more precise? The valley communities have not benefited. There has been a rise in unemployment, and the industrial base is rapidly being eroded. I wish that the right hon. Gentleman would be more precise, instead of making vague generalisations—which is his wont. I am greatly worried about farms in the Rhondda, as there has been a 50 per cent cut in agricultural land since the Penrhys golf course was extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the hon. Gentleman an appropriate response. In response to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile), I emphasise that I am concerned about any increase in unemployment. However, the rate for the whole of Powys is 7.1 per cent. I acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers). Unemployment in mid-Glamorgan in 13 per cent. In Montgomery, 1,264 people are unemployed, whereas in Rhondda there are 4,070. I recognise the serious challenge posed by unemployment, and I shall deal with the issue of the valleys in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State realise that last year Britian's food trade deficit was £6 billion? That is probably the highest ever such deficit in peacetime. In addition, there was a deficit of about £12 billion in manufacturing. What on earth are the Government doing? They are doing as badly on agriculture as they are on manufacturing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like Wales to market its produce effectively and, in particular, to persuade the housewife to buy Welsh products. That is why, in an age of consumer choice, I lay stress on the importance of ensuring that our marketing strategy is right. However, as I said during the Committee's previous sitting, there is more to agricultural policy than that. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Opposition Members and my right hon. and hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key factor in the success of Wales is our magnificent record in attracting inward investment from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
rest of the United Kingdom, Europe, north America and Japan. The Japanese experience is the most spectacular, and, is much more dramatic than that of the remainder of the United Kingdom. However, while fostering our key relationship with Japan we must not forget that 140 American and Canadian companies and more than 150 companies from Europe are located in Wales. In the calendar year 1990 and the financial year 1990–91, a record number of projects were secured and a record number of jobs were created and safeguarded. In the last financial year, there were 147 projects promising 15,000 new or safeguarded jobs and a capital investment of over £500 million pounds. In recent years 745 inward investment projects have been secured, promising more than 85,000 jobs. The inward investment effort has attracted a vast range of sectors to strengthen the Welsh the Welsh industrial base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. I intend to refer to Llanberis later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to highlight the dramatic increase in employment in the automotive industry. Bosch and Toyota are now establishing major plant at Miskin and Deeside, which will bring 1,500 jobs. The British Airways operation at Cardiff airport promises 1,200 jobs in aerospace. In electronics—a growth sector to which I have already referred—there is the Gooding—Sanken project. In chemical industries, there are Cabot and Dow Corning. We are making considerable headway in securing projects for all parts of Wales, rather than for only the obvious sites along the M4 corridor and in the industrial north-east. I was delighted to announce earlier this year that Euro DPC is to establish a facility at Llanberis that will employ 200 people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene on that point, although I am delighted that progress is being made and that the factory now has a roof on it. It is making excellent speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Secretary of State ensure, through the staff of the Welsh Office and the Welsh Development Agency, that the attention of Japanese inward investors and industrialists is drawn to areas such as Gwynedd? Japanese pharmaceutical companies are examining Wales and there is an excellent opportunity in Gwynedd. To maximise that opportunity, we must maintain our transport infrastructure. I must again press the right hon. Gentleman about the cuts in the through rail service from Bangor to London. The service will be cut from six trains a day to three at the end of September. Two of those trains are at 4 am and 6 am, and are not convenient, and the other is in the middle of the afternoon. That is a devastating blow to those who are trying to attract industry to Gwynedd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite easy to refer to the number of trains while failing to recognise that, for the first time, we have through InterCity 125 services to Holyhead. That is a considerable advance. It is important to be able to tell inward investors that instead of a four-and-a-half hour journey—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it is four-and-a-half hours with the change of engine at Crewe. Instead of that, we now promise a significantly shorter journey on a through train. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of infrastructure. That is why, when I meet the chairman of British Rail, I constantly impress on him the importance of improving services to north Wales, especially those connecting it to London. I shall continue to press for that, as I press for other vital services to mid and south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question, at every opportunity we draw the attention of a range of companies, including Japanese companies, to the possibilities and attractions of investing in key areas of Wales such as Gwynedd. Industrialists will find in Gwynedd all the attractions that are found elsewhere in Wales, as well as the most beautiful environment in which to work and live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that, perhaps, the greatest landmark for Wales has been Sony's announcement that it will base its major new development at Bridgend. It is the largest individual investment by a Japanese company in Wales. Some hon. Members may not know that that investment was won in the teeth of intense competition, especially from Barcelona.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), the Secretary of State said how much he was pressing for the extension of railway services, and he took the credit for the new through service. How can he take credit for any improvement in rail services and show his great influence with British Rail, while at the same time, when we approach him about cuts in vital services into the south Wales valleys, he does his usual Pontius Pilate act and washes his hands and says that the matter has nothing to do with the Government? Does the right hon. Gentleman really have any influence with British Rail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not do a Pontius Pilate act—that is more usual among Opposition Members. I merely said to the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), who was pressing for more trams, that he should accept that there has been a vital improvement, which I welcome. I should like there to be more services and I hope that the traffic will justify them, especially on the vital new through route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial phase of the Sony technology park will create 1,400 new jobs, with a potential to generate many more. That is tremendous news for mid Glamorgan and for the whole of Wales. It is just one of the 42 projects that I have been able to announce this year, supported by my Department and involving £254 million of investment and creating more than 3,700 new jobs, while safeguarding well over 600 others. A total of more than £31.5 million in regional selective assistance has been offered towards those projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do so many companies want to invest in Wales? The answer is that we have the skills and infrastructure available, but above all we have the committed work
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
force. The productivity of the Welsh work force has increased by leaps and bounds in recent years. Net output per employee in manufacturing in 1988 in the United Kingdom was £25,114. In Wales it was £29,294. That means that the figure for Wales was 16.6 per cent higher than the average, and the highest in the United Kingdom. Output in production and construction in Wales has also risen much faster than in the United Kingdom as a whole. In fact, it has risen twice as fast since 1985. Manufacturing output has done even better—between 1985 and 1990, it grew by more than 30 per cent, compared with just under 15 per cent in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key factors in that performance has been the work of the Welsh Development Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned inward investment, which all hon. Members welcome. However, he also spoke about the chemical industry. I wonder whether he is aware that ICI employs more than 800 people in Wales? Six hundred of those employees are in my constituency. They are naturally very anxious about Lord Hanson's possible bid for ICI and the effects that it will have on the industry. What does the Secretary of State intend to do about that bid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has not been a bid so far. No doubt the points raised by the hon. Gentleman will be familiar to people outside the Committee. When a formal approach is made, it will be for the Director General of Fair Trading to advise my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of the investment about which the Secretary of State has spoken—and which is very welcome in Wales—comes from the European Community. Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that links with the European Community, and especially with parts of the Community such as Baden-Wűrttemberg, are vital for Wales' development, and that the divisions within the Government are jeopardising those links? Will the Secretary of State say whether he belongs to the Heathite tendency or to the Thatcherite tendency—the Parliamentary Under-Secretary belong to the latter group—or will he fall at the Major fence ahead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to assure the hon. Gentleman that there are no divisions in the Government on that matter. I agree that the links between Wales and the key regions of Europe are of paramount importance. I welcome the opportunity that the hon. Gentleman has given me to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker). With my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, I have done my best to establish even stronger links with Baden-Wűrttemberg, Rhône-Alpes, Lombardy and Catalonia. We intend to do everything possible to build on those links, which are growing stronger all the time.

I was speaking about the WDA, for which I was delighted to secure for this financial year resources of £160 million, the highest ever. I have had occasion previously to pay tribute to the work of the WDA, and I know that here, at least, I am on common ground with Opposition Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Foot 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman voted against the establishment of the WDA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman gives me a longevity that I do not yet have in the House of Commons. I was not present at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £160 million, which the Government spent on the WDA in one year, is more in cash terms than the entire spending allocated to the WDA under Labour. It is the highest budget in both cash and real terms that the WDA has ever received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to three aspects of the work of the WDA. One is the financial services initiative that my precedessor launched, together with the WDA, and which has now produced 20 projects for Wales covering a wide range of financial activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment in the sector has grown by 20 per cent in recent years, and we are now well on the way to having 100,000 people employed in financial services in Wales by the end of the decade. The second is the new information technology initiative—IT Wales—which I was proud to launch with the WDA last week. Wales already has 350 companies in that fast-growing sector, and IT Wales will be building on that by providing expert and targeted assistance. It will also have a marvellous selling point in the new science park that it is developing at Newport, in conjunction with the university of London's Imperial college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was Imperial college's decision to come to Wales to set up that prestige project. The research and development facilities that it will provide will, in turn, attract new science-based companies to Wales and will be a new resource for companies already in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third aspect of the Welsh Development Agency's work that I want to talk about is its property programme. That plays a vital role in ensuring that quality sites and premises are available in Wales to meet the requirements of inward investment and indigenous businesses. The agency's ability to assist in providing suitable sites and premises has played a key part in attracting major inward investment projects. For the current financial year, I am pleased to confirm that its property programme will represent a total investment by the agency of more than £71 million. I am delighted to announce that the details of the programme will be published today by the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme will provide the capacity to create more than 2 million sq. ft. of factories and commercial work space. That, in turn, could accommodate up to 5,000 new jobs throughout Wales. Some £50 million will be devoted to direct property activities, while more than £20 million will be spent on joint venture schemes with the private sector, levering £75 million of investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman, with his customary generosity, paid trib-

ute to his precedecessor. Can I bring him back from his hallucinatary vision of unreality to the truth of what has happened in Wales? Seeking the truth, as one always does, I asked recently what effect the valleys initiative had had, and I was told that the unemployment ratio in the valley initiative area is now higher than it was two years ago. Has not Lord Crickhowell's forcast come true—that the so-called achievements would disappear like the morning mist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's assertion. The programme for the valleys initiative was announced on 14 June 1988, so we are debating it just after its third anniversary. I shall be reporting on its progress in due course, and in the usual way, by presenting a report to Parliament. In its first three years, the programme has had a significant impact on the economy of the valleys. More than 20,000 jobs have been created or safeguarded. About 1 million sq. ft. of factory space is in the process of being created, and about £450 million of private sector investment has been secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of the programme lies in its integrated approach. About £800 million is available for the valleys over the five years of the programme. The unemployment figures are substantially less than they were four or five years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. The Minister is deliberately misleading the Committee. He has given statistics from when the valleys programme was introduced, but he is distorting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee by making such a statement. He is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I recognise that unemployment in the valleys has increased, that still represents a substantial reduction in the unemployment figures of five years ago that I quoted earlier. I stick by what I said. Naturally, I want employment in the valleys, and I should like to return to that subject in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am leaving tomorrow on an inward investment mission to north America, and I shall be meeting various representatives of top companies to discuss their investment plans. I hope that we, in Wales, do not feel isolated from that economy. The United States of America and Canada have recently been experiencing serious difficulties. Indeed, the economy in the United States is now in its 10th month of recession, and the Canadian economy—the world's eight largest—is going through its second worst recession since the war. However, in both countries, as in Wales, the indicators suggest that the worst of recession may be over and that there is now the beginning of a recovery. Therefore, now is an excellent time to impress again on the north Americans the advantages of investment in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardif, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman made generous remarks about his predecessor. Will he take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of local authorities? So far, he has mentioned inward investment and railway services, which were saved by the investment of the local authorities in mid and south Glamorgan. He also referred to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
the valleys initiative and the links with Germany. All those are matters on which our Labour local authorities have taken a strong and positive lead for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to pay tribute to local authorities. The hon. Gentleman should not make party points by singling out only Labour local authorities. Whatever the political leadership of the local authorities, we are working closely with them and have a positive relationship. They contribute substantially to the Welsh economy. I have published a consultation paper setting out clear proposals for the future. I await with great interest that consultation period, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will contribute to the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not leave the subject of the Welsh economy without saying more about the future prosperity of rural Wales. At the previous sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee. I announced the rural initiative. Since then, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have consulted extensively with local authorities and agencies. I have received also many valuable contributions to our discussions from voluntary organisations, local communities and individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and I were very impressed and heartened by the unanimity of support that we received for the rural initiative from all quarters. We also appreciated the thought that clearly has been devoted to such issues by the contributors, and the objective way in which they commented on the partnerships that must be maintained in rural Wales among local and central Government—including the Welsh Office—the voluntary sector and local communities. The consultation process is now complete, and I am considering all the representations that have been made. I propose to publish our conclusions and objectives before the summer recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also announced at our previous sitting that I would find an additional £5 million for the support of projects proposed by local authorities that were likely to be of most benefit to the development of rural communities. The response to that programme has indeed been over-whelming, with 265 applications being received for projects valued at more than £36 million. In appraising those many proposals—a difficult task—I have worked closely with the relevant agencies, notably the Development Board for Rural Wales, the Welsh Development Agency and the Wales tourist board. I am most grateful for their assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a consequence, I am today announcing the 35 successful projects. They represent a diverse and exciting mix of developments that will help to improve the environment and the social and economic well-being of communities in many rural parts of the Principality. They include information technology networks for small businesses in Dyfed and Gwynedd, a new terminal at the mid-Wales airport, a local community radio station at Newtown, Powys, and a major development of the Lyric theatre in Carmarthen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the right hon. Gentleman's initiative; the response from local communities shows its value. Will he now take the opportunity to announce
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
an extension of the programme to deal with the over-subscription of applications? That will ensure not only a further £5 million, but that the initiative becomes a rolling programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now considering ways in which I can respond to some of the exciting and innovative ideas put to my right hon. Friend and myself during the rural initiative. I hope to make an announcement about that in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Wardell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome what the Secretary of State said about the initiatives in Wales. I am sure that he knows about the initiative of the Welsh Development Agency to extend its scheme into the village of Penclawdd on the north coast of the Gower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the balance between inward investment and indigenous growth, how does the right hon. Gentleman propose to ensure that the clearing banks do not continue to hammer small businesses by charging local rates as high as 17 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want hon. Members to give me specific examples. Each example brought to my attention—there have been few so far—has immediately been taken up with the chairman of the bank concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a topic that I believe is close to the heart of many Opposition Members—the economy in the Welsh valleys. I have already made some comments on the points raised. I believe that a co-ordinated strategy can revitalise an economy, although it cannot insulate an area from economic events elsewhere. The combination of inward investment, urban programme money and the other initiatives that I have described, as well as the initiatives in health and housing, leisure and voluntary activity, is helping to revive those communities affected by the decline of their traditional industries. However, it is not enough to concentrate on purely economic measures, essential though they are. I have always believed in the importance of putting local communities at the heart of the regeneration process. Without the commitment and support of our communities in Wales, our efforts would be only partially successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last December, I asked the people of the valleys to show what they could do. I announced that I would make funds available to four or five communities in the valleys to undertake their own regeneration. I asked them to submit innovative and imaginative schemes that would act as pilots not only for the valleys, but for the whole of Wales. I was delighted to receive 45 applications for that community revival initiative. I especially welcome communities that have worked out schemes with their local authorities. I hope that some of the excellent schemes that could not be accommodated in the present initiative, for which I have allocated £2.5 million, will be re-submitted for funding under a main programme. As with the rural initiatives, I have made my decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to announce that the following strategies have been approved. Penrhiwceibr in the Cynon valley will receive £593,000 over the next two years.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
The Tonmawr 2000 project in the borough of Neath will receive £500,000, and £500,000 will go to the Glyn Taff Farm Estate in Taff-Ely. The Glencorrwg ponds co-operative, also in west Glamorgan, will receive £477,500, and £429,000 will go to the Coedcae estate in Blaenau-Gwent. That is a total distribution of £2.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes cover a wide variety of innovative projects devised by local people to meet their particular needs. As well as providing buildings for community use and improving the environment, they will create exciting business opportunities and an imaginative range of leisure facilities for local people. I am delighted to give those five communities the opportunity to carry out their own proposals for revival. I know that hon. Members will join me in wishing them every success in their efforts over the next two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enthusiasm of the local authorities and the communities for taking part in strategies by which they can contribute to their own regeneration is a symbol of the spirit of the people of Wales, which contributes so much to our success as a location for investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman showers figures and initiatives on us like confetti, but for all their impact on areas such as Neath, the valleys and the whole of south Wales, they might as well be blown away in the wind. The recession is biting deep, unemployment is rising, training has been cut and businesses are at their wits' end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put to the Secretary of State a figure that was mentioned in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> on 26 April 1991. The paper reported that he had announced that almost 15,000 new or safeguarded jobs had been secured for the Principality. When pressed on that figure, the Welsh Office could account for only 28 companies providing just 4,618 of the new or safeguarded jobs. Where have the 10,000 missing jobs gone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to scrutinise the Order Paper and 	<i>Hansard</i> a little more carefully. If he had, he would noted that I have already replied to the hon. Member for Meirionydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) and that I have placed in the Library full details of almost everyone of the projects that was described. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) has not caught up with that yet. Perhaps when he has, he will revert to me. I am sorry that he did not welcome the project in the borough of Neath—he missed an opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many applications were made for the schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that there were 45 applications, and that five were granted. There are other opportunities for those programmes. The borough of Rhondda, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Rhondda, merely resubmitted—and I am not criticising it for that—the projects that had not been funded by the urban programme. I am sure that it will submit them again and I should like the borough to produce a number of projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been hoping to intervene for some time, so I shall give way to him. I hope that I shall then be allowed to conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all delighted with the good news that the Secretary of State has just given us about the initiatives in rural and south Wales. Many of the small businesses in those areas are run by Welsh speakers. Can the right hon. Gentleman assure the Committee that he will introduce a Welsh language Act as soon as possible? What are the latest developments on the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the projects. When hon. Members examine them, they will realise that they are exciting, innovative and imaginative schemes. I pay tribute to the many people who have spent a long time working out the schemes within their own communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always made it clear that I want the Welsh language to represent and underpin everything in Wales to do with our tradition, culture and heritage. I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognise that the Government have taken historic steps in support of the Welsh language. We shall continue that work. We set up the Welsh Language Board, which has now delivered draft legislation to me as Secretary of State. I have asked my officials to set up a working party to consider in detail all the board's recommendations. I shall respond in due course, after the provisions have been examined carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to a wide-ranging debate on the Welsh economy. Labour Members will seek to highlight it as a debate on the recession, but I am grateful to the House for deciding that, rather than go down that road, we should debate the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only had time to discuss some of the subjects that impact on the Welsh economy. I could also discuss education, especially the links with business, the exciting developments in higher and further education, compacts, training credits, support for small businesses, the vital investment in infrastructure, the increasingly important role of women in the labour market and the tie-up with the environment. There are also the exciting plans for the national garden festival next year and for Valleys Life, the arts festival that will take place at the same time and following the garden festival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time does not permit me to go into detail on those matters, but I wish to discuss one particular subject. Looking to the future, we must all recognise how vital our training programme will be in retaining and improving our position in the world market. We have put in place the widest range of measures ever available to help the unemployed back to work. The Government's measures and expenditure plans for helping the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
long-term unemployed back are a balanced package. Our funding of employment training and our increased provision, including that available through the employment service, represent a massive response to meeting the needs of the unemployed. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment has said, we shall put every effort into ensuring that every unemployed person receives as much help as possible to find a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh economy, like that of the remainder of the United Kingdom and many parts of the world, has been going through a difficult period. I do not deny that. I remind Labour Members that talk of a recession and doom and gloom can too easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I am determined that the real progress that we have made over the past decade in Wales should not be belittled. I am going to north America to say that Wales is a worthwhile and exciting location for investment. The economy has been transformed, the work force is adaptable and capable, and the quality of life is superb. I believe that Wales, the land of quality, is a winner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to welcome two new Members to the Committee—the hon. Members for Neath (Mr. Hain) and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards). I hope that they find our deliberations of interest and of practical value to their constituents. It is also my great pleasure to congratulate the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) on being made a Privy Councillor. He holds the unique distinction of serving in the Government since it was elected in 1979. It is a well-merited honour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many right hon. and hon. Members have requested to speak in the debate. If I am to call each of them, it will mean short speeches. By that, I mean speeches of 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour at the most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I aim to make a brief speech, and I shall comment first on the Secretary of State's remarks. His speech contained brassy assertions, hopeful slogans, dubious statistics and a crushing indifference to the real problems of the real people of Wales. I do not want to hear any more sermons from the right hon. Gentleman, who represents the salubrious English Wirrall, as to what we should or should not say in this debate. We speak for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute most generously to those valley communities and Labour local authorities in the valleys who have submitted their initiatives and proposals. In this difficult economic climate, those councils should have the thanks of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Hughes, have already congratulated the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts). I sincerely add my congratulations, and say that all my right hon. and hon. Friends congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on a much delayed honour. He is known affectionately in Whitehall and Westminster as the Bardic streamroller. Such an engine has a capacity to inch its way forward, deviating neither left nor right. I do not know on what fuel the hon. Gentleman operates. Is it gas, alcohol, water or diesel? Whatever it is, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
works, and over the years the right hon. Gentleman has proved that he gets there in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government if, indeed, they were responsible for steering towards my constituency the great Continental Can £8 million investment and the 60 new jobs that will come about in the near future. I say "thank you" to the whole of the right hon. Gentleman's Department. We are also pleased about the inward investment by Sony at Bridgend, Toyota at Deeside, Bosch at Miskin and the development by British Airways. The right hon. Gentleman forgot to say that six Welsh companies have recently been given the Queen's Award. Penny and Giles at Blackwood received the award for advancing technology. The Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales are doing a magnificent job during the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later today, with the Secretary of State for Wale's I shall meet a Korean delegation. We shall work together for the greater good for Wales. When the right hon. Gentleman goes to the United States and to Canada, and when his right hon. Friend goes to Germany, they will have the Opposition's backing in aiming to obtain investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must draw to the Committeer's attention the Secretary of State's record. We are in a recession, and unemployment in Wales has risen for 12 of the past 13 months. On Thursday's figures, seasonally adjusted, unemployment in Wales is now 112,000. The right hon. Gentleman did not tell us that. Unemployment has risen by 29,000, or 35 per cent, in the past 12 months, by 21,000, or 24 per cent, since November and by 12 per cent since February. That is a serious situation, yet the right hon. Gentleman glossed over it. He did not have the courage to tackle the problem that faces us in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Output in the second half of last year fell by 5.6 per cent, according to the recently published Welsh Office index of production and construction. Even the Welsh Office press release admitted that an overall decline of 3.7 per cent in the final quarter of 1990 reflected "widespread contraction". The latest industrial trends survey of the Confederation of British Industry shows that employment fell more markedly over the four months to April than in any period since October 1982. The right hon. Gentleman must be told that bankruptcies in Wales have risen by more than 60 per cent in the past year. There were 221 bankruptcies and 125 liquidations in Wales in the first three months of 1991. The right hon. Gentleman's speech was over-sanguine; it obliterated the facts about Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This month, another 300 redundancies were announced at Hoover in Merthyr Tydfil. In May, it was announced that 150 jobs were expected to go at Milford Haven, where the trawler companies are in great difficulty. Thorn EMI announced the loss of 500 jobs at the Thorn Lighting lightbulb factory in Merthyr Tydfil. I understand that 1,000 national health service workers in south Glamorgan are worried and uncertain about the nature and future of their jobs. The chairman of the Wales tourist board said that job losses are inevitable in Wales because of the recession. Unless there is an upturn in the economy, many jobs will be lost in that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
Redundancies are likely after the Bank of Scotland's takeover of the Commercial Bank of Wales. In April, it was made clear that 370 jobs would be lost in Northern Telecom in Treforest, and Courtaulds announced the loss of more than 200 jobs in Llanelli. The Courtaulds factory at Pyle in Bridgend will also shed jobs. There will be 300 job losses at J. R. Freeman in Cardiff and Port Talbot and 95 at Powell Duffryn in Cardiff. The right hon. Gentleman did not mention those facts and figures and the likely job losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another matter that causes anxiety is the impact of the recession on the high street and its effect on many small shops? In those circumstances, the increase in the uniform business rate and the high level of water charges are creating overheads that will drive many businesses into bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. He may emphasise the savage effect of high interest rates on the high streets of Wales if he catches your eye later, Mr. Hughes. The Unversity College of Wales fears that agriculture-related redundancies are increasing. Lucas Girling fears that there will be 200 redundancies in Cwmbran. Sixty jobs may be lost at Brother computers in Clywd. At Siliconix, the high-tech factory in Morriston, Swansea, 300 jobs are to go. Penalta colliery, near Ystrad Mynach, will lose 400 jobs—that is a severe blow. AB Electronics announced 125 redundancies in March and 250 lay-offs. The right hon. Gentleman did not mention that. In Ferodo in Caernarvon, at least 55 jobs will go. On 1 March, I learnt of 238 job losses at Shotton steel in my constituency. At the BBC and Harlech television, 500 jobs are likely to go. In February, the Building Employers Confederation warned that 4,000 jobs in the Welsh construction industry may be lost because of the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a recession, and it was created by the right hon. Gentleman's Government—but he said nothing about it in his speech. On 30 January, the deep navigation pit closed and 400 job losses were announced. Sealink closed its Holyhead railfreight terminal. On 10 January, British Coal announced its decision to axe 62 white-collar jobs at Ystrad Mynach. The right hon. Gentleman skated over those harsh realities and gave no hint of how he would tackle the recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already celebrated successes with the Secretary of State, but I shall place on record facts about my constituency. Brymbo Steel has been affected by the recession; 200 jobs have been lost at Castle Cement; some have been lost at Laura Ashley and Style Furniture. Those full-time jobs had status; they required skill and provided people with holidays and pensions. Those jobs were valued, but they have been lost. The right hon. Gentleman's policies have led to that deplorable situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

have visited Johnstown. I know that my hon. Friend fights consistently for the community. He has warned about impending job losses, which is a serious development. My hon. Friend would be entitled to insist on visiting the Secretary of State's office with his deputation to confront the Cabinet Minister who has backed policies that have led to that reprehensible state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from the Department of Employment's publication:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the past six months the seasonally adjusted series has risen by 3,600 a month on average … The stock of unfilled vacancies … fell by 2,100 in the month to May."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends who represent valley communities have made interventions. The Government have produced statistics on valley communities such as Rhondda, Pontypridd, Ogmore, Merthyr Tydfil, Cynon Valley, Caerphilly and Bridgend. The statistics contain a savage set of figures. There are 2,914 unemployed citizens in Bridgend. At the other end of the scale, Rhondda has 4,070 out of work. We are talking about one county, one series of valleys and a large number of communities. The impact of the right hon. Gentleman's policies has been to send those figures soaring. Many manufacturing jobs have been lost in those valleys. All the good news given to us by the right hon. Gentleman will come to nought in terms of employment unless the Government change the policies that have destroyed jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not take well to speeches such as the one just made by the right hon. Gentleman. Mid-Glamorgan's unemployment rate remains in the top ten of all British comparable counties, second only to Cleveland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) is in his seat. I am sorry to tell him that between May 1990 and May 1991, unemployment in his area, increased by 58 per cent. What comment has he on the policies of his right hon. Friend? He has none. During that period, there has been a 43 per cent rise in unemployment in the constituency of Delyn. In the constituency of Pembroke, according to the House of Commons Library, the increase has been 39 per cent. The former Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), may not know this, but unemployment in his constituency has increased by 35 per cent. He may wish to tell the Committee his views on his right hon. Friend's policies, which have led to this deplorable situation. In the constituency of Clwyd, North-West, unemployment has gone up by 21 per cent, while in Conwy, the Minister of State's constituency, it has risen by 16 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must also be said that in Bridgend there has been a colossal rise in unemployment of 58 per cent. In the constituency of Newport, East the figure is 49 per cent. In my constituency of Alyn and Deeside, which has made creditable efforts to reorganise, reconstitute and make more comprehensive its economic base, unemployment increased by 45 per cent. Notwithstanding that, where work in my constituency is concerned I pay tribute to the Welsh Office and to the WDA for what has been done to help to attract blue chip companies to my area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

vis investment and the prospect of jobs coming into our constituencies, if the Government fail to act after those decisions have been made we may not benefit fully from the investment that has already been announced? I shall give a classic example. We are delighted that British Airways has decided to come to Cardiff airport with the prospect of 1,300 precision engineering jobs. However, if the Ministry of Defence does not allow RAF St. Athan to enhance the pay of the existing precision engineering civilian workers on that camp, British Airways will simply poach the labour from that area and we will not benefit. Government action should not stop after investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. In 	<i>The Times</i> today—the house magazine of the Government—its business and finance section carries the headline, "No economic upturn in sight". The article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury must realise that harping on about inflation is not going to spark a recovery or even increase confidence … What industrialists, consumers, voters and even currency speculators now require is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to economic growth. The only way to send this message is to cut interest rates boldly".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend was right to make the intervention that he did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The front page of the business section of 	<i>The Times</i> today carries the headlines, 	<i>"Output and productivity fall sharply"</i> and "Grim figures hurt hopes for recovery". The article talks of a false dawn and states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the end of the recession is not yet in sight."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman should wake up: the situation is serious and the Government's policies are not helping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point and I agree with him. However, does he agree that we need our own parliament in Wales? Was he disappointed when he heard the Secretary of State announce last week that he was not in favour of home rule? As there are only 11 months before the next general election, will the hon. Gentleman asure the Committee and Wales that the Labour party will introduce legislation so that the people of Wales can have their own Welsh Parliament within the forseeable future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made my party's position clear. Wales needs a Labour Government and the present Secretary of State taken out of office. We are experiencing the second Conservative recession during 12 years of uninterrupted Conservative Administrations. Those 12 years have seen £100 billion of oil receipts and receipts for family silver in excess of £25 billion. The Government's record is a disgrace, and the Secretary of State's record is not far short of that. It was disgraceful of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say that rising unemployment was a price worth paying. That was insulting to the unemployed people of Wales. The Government are saying in Wales, "Don't blame us; we are only the Government." When they finally admitted that there is a recession, they blamed it on everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help remembering that after the Budget in March the Secretary of State said that there was a good
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
deal of optimism about the resiliance of the economy. Since then, unemployment has risen by 10,000. In February the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The North Wales economy can look forward to a brighter future".</p></blockquote>
I have referred to some of the job losses since then at British Steel, Ferodo, Austin Taylor in Gwynedd, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future success of the Welsh economy after the recession will turn on our ability to cater for the specialised needs of a new generation of sophisticated inward investors. I shall refer first to education and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing divergence between Wales and Scotland. The staying-on rate for 17-year-olds is substantially better in Scotland than in Wales and there seems to be a better mix of academic and vocational courses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, research, development and technology transfer is the key to any strategy to increase the quality of the Welsh economy. I welcome wholeheartedly the Welsh Development Agency's new IT Wales initiative. It has great potential, but it assumes that Wales has the necessary skilled technicians and graduates to support an expansion of information technology employment in Wales. What is being done to ensure that training is adequate to supply those skilled workers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that any unemployed person in west Wales and, I believe, in Great Britain over the age of 24 is denied any training for two years from the time that that person was made unemployed. If he makes an application at the end of that two years, he is put at the back of the queue. What sort of investment for the future is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no investment for the future, and the Minister of State must reply to that cogent intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point relates to Europe. Has the Minister of State made any estimate of the proportion of the European framework funds for new technology that has come to Wales? I believe that the vast proportion of European funds to stimulate new technology in Great Britain goes to the south-east of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been liberal in allowing hon. Members to intervene. I am grateful for having perhaps the last opportunity to do so. He spent some time in his speech underlining the high unemployment in Wales, and referred specifically to Bridgend and Ogmore. He will recall that in 1983 I represented the Bridgend area of the Ogmore constituency. When I was elected in 1979, unemployment was 3.7 per cent. Despite the Government's doctored figures, unemployment is now 23 per cent.—a 20 per cent. increase in my Ogmore constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also mentioned the IT programme. I was alarmed when I heard how much help the Secretary of State is giving to the programme. Many people were made redundant by the Government's decision, assisted by the Mid-Glamorgan technical college, to refuse to continue funding CATO—Community
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
Activities and Training in Ogmore. That led to 450 places being lost and the loss of about 45 trainers. Is it not time that the Government did something positive about unemployment training?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed time. There has been a colossal increase in unemployment in Ogmore. I have visited my hon. Friend's constituency and I am familiar with his attempts to cope with the massive flow of unemployment. I commend the wonderful work that he has done. The Secretary of State must come forward with urgent measures to assist the constituency in its hour of need, in the knowledge that the figures are clearly and comprehensively doctored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a short-term programme of temporary special employment measures for the Welsh unemployed. We need a strong regional policy with emphasis on high technology. We need investment in education too. It is time for the Government to consider establishing an investment bank as an arm of the WDA. We must have a technology trust that will improve and expand technology transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy failures have hit Wales terribly hard. The Government have created a recession and compounded it. Manufacturing output has fallen and so has manufacturing investment. Manufacturing is seriously under pressure in Wales. Moreover, fast-growing unemployment is hitting the professions, small businesses and many other occupations. Interest rates are also far too high for our future prosperity. We are seeing a contraction of our industrial strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Secretary of State has imposed the poll tax on Wales, that he is tampering with the national health service and that he is disseminating policies that encourage unemployment. That is his record. He must not be complacent. Instead, he must listen. He should be developing a strategy to help industries in Wales to prepare for the next century and the colossal competition that we shall face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, the right hon. Gentleman has only six Conservative Members in Wales to assist him. Soon there will be fewer. I can tell him that when the general election takes place, he and his colleagues will be thrown out of office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by expressing the sorrow that many of us feel about the death of Sir John Stradling Thomas. He was not a frequent contributor to our debates; but his wise counsel was always available to any of us who sought it. I wish also to add my congratulations to the many already expressed to my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Mr. Roberts), the Minister of State, Welsh Office. His promotion gave great pleasure to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), whose speech was long on details of gloom but short on details about specific proposals to improve matters. I support the statement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that Wales is much better place in which to weather the storm than it was in which to weather
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
previous recessions. That is because of the diversification and inward investment that was brought about by the intelligent and flexible use that my right hon. Friend and his Conservative predecessors made of bodies such as the Welsh Development Agency, the Mid Wales Board, the Wales tourist board and the Land Authority for Wales. I know that the Labour party set up most of those bodies and that we Conservatives were none too happy about them at the outset. However, everything hinges on how interventionist bodies such as the WDA will be used and what the role of the Government and quasi-governmental bodies will be in shaping industrial policy. Is that role to launch new enterprises, or to enable existing ones to get round a tricky corner? Is it to prop up for as long as possible enterprises in which many hundreds of Welsh people work, and upon which whole communities depend, but which face the necessity of structural change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not underestimate the pressure on the Government, still less those on hon. Members, from firms that face long-term structural problems. For example, the concentration of steel-making in south Wales has been a triumphant success. The economy of Deeside has been transformed for the better by the introduction of new, modern and diversified industries. Even so, it would be unreasonable to expect the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), who valiantly led the fight to retain steel-making at Shotton in the 1970s, to admit that the closure—which seemed to be a catastrophe for hs constituency at the time—in the end was the means of the area's salvation. I make no criticism of the hon. Gentleman—indeed, at the time I gave him what support I could. However, I was left rather breathless by the agility with which he contrived, when he was a Minister in the Welsh Office, to extract favourable local publicity by savagely attacking his Government for their failure to provide the necessary investment for Shotton, while he was, at the same time, getting himself photographed opening new schools and hospitals that were generously provided by the Welsh Office. However, we all tend to do such things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was more indignant at the Labour Government's refusal to provide the investment that was necessary for Shotton's survival while hypocritically claiming that they would never close it. Nevertheless, doubts remain, and Governments, especially Labour Governments, have a pretty consistent record for picking losers. Often they were pressured into doing so by hon. Members. The story of British Leyland is an awful warning. Pressure from hon. Members, many of them Conservative, led to the rejection of rescue packages that would have been as prompt, every bit as effective, and much less costly to the taxpayer, as that which was eventually and expensively provided by British Aerospace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of Governments is not just a matter of picking losers. There is also a tradition of seeking to hobble winners. I still recall the grim determination with which the previous Labour Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris), sought to prevent Rhuddlan borough council from going ahead with its sun centre, which is one of the top tourist attractions in Wales and the salvation of Rhyl's once tottering tourist industry.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman turned down every application for grant aid and leant as heavily as he could on the merchant bankers who had stepped in to see the scheme through and tried to scare them off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No, thank you, Mr. Hughes. I do not have much confidence in that kind of direct intervention. Nor do I trust Labour Governments who are under pressure—from their Back Benchers and from trade unions in firms that have failed to keep abreast of technological change and to respond to the preferences of the market—to make a hands-off, flexible use of interventionist organs such as the WDA or the Mid Wales Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever mistakes the Government may have made, they have usually made them by going too fast down a road that the Labour party was pushing them to do down faster still. I have little confidence in the Labour party's ability either to choose the right solutions or to back them. Moreover, it was, until recently, Labour party policy to withdraw from the EEC. That is still the policy of the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies). This Government's policies will pull the country out of recession. Above all, I believe that the policies which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is pursuing in Wales will put Wales at the vanguard of the process of recovery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly offer my congratulations to my hon. Friends the Members for Neath (Mr. Hain) and for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards), who are here for the first time to enjoy the joys of the Welsh Grand Committee, and also to the Minister of State. We may have to rewrite the text books. I have heard of an animal or institution called a permanent under-secretary; we have devised a new one called the permanent Minister of State. It is a completely new institution in Government, and the right hon. Member is the first to hold that office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Secretary of State that we do not need the Confederation of British Industry or the Institute of Directors to tell us what is happening to our communities, the people living there and to our jobs. We know what is happening because we live in our communities and share in their ups and downs. I have friends and family and I know parents of children in school who received the imperious redundancy notices from Hoover only a week or so ago. There are families in which the husband and father will lose his job at Hoover and the wife and mother will lose her job at Thorn EMI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite his initial comments that he was not complacent, the image portrayed by the Secretary of State does not convey the character and nature of the jobs crisis in communities such as mine. Even by the Government's own fiddled figures, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has more than 15 per cent male unemployment; inevitably, that figure will reach 20 per cent or more. That is a wicked and unnecessary waste of ability, talent, experience, interest and initiative. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
addition to the general level of unemployment, we have had the tragic news of the closure of Thorn, the Hoover redundancies and the closure on Good Friday of Deep Navigation Pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The image portrayed by the Secretary of State is not the one seen through the eyes of the people of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. It looks as through we have come full circle; we are almost back to 1980–81. That is the worrying image held by many of my constituents. The stress and pain of restructuring, the productivity gains about which the Secretary of State spoke, the jobs that were lost voluntarily to put many of our companies into shape and the hundreds of pages of legislation to implement the theories of Thatcherite economics have all ended up in a situation very similar to that in 1980–81: a recession, rising unemployment and, in some cases, the tragic closure of companies. I am sorry to say to the Secretary of State and to the Committee that it ain't much of an economic miracle for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the previous Welsh Question Time, the Secretary of State rightly observed—and he also rightly pointed out that I have never made the case—that the tragic announcement of the closure of Thorn was not the consequence of recession or of Government policy. I accept that. However, the job losses at Hoover are very much the consequence of recession. When the market for automatic washing machines collapses from 9,000 to 3,000 machines a week, that is the direct and inevitable consequence of economic policy, high interest rates and general mismanagement of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad, poignant irony is that that mismanagement and the inflation that it caused in 1986–87—now to be squeezed out by our jobs, by our unemployment—were not caused by the people of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. They did not make excessive wage claims. Indeed the Secretary of State himself claimed that productivity was rising rapidly and that sensible wage claims had been submitted. In fact, there was a nonsensical property boom in a part of Britian deliberately fostered and promoted by the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore, inflation must be wrapped around the neck of this Government. We are paying, with our jobs, to squeeze out a self-created, A Government-created, inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The announcement about Thorn is an especially bitter blow to our community. With Hoover, it was one of the two major pillars of the post-war economy. The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) said that we had to change the smoke-stack industries and close our steelworks and pits. But those companies are not steelworks and pits. They are supposed to be the replacement economy of our coal and steel communities. They, too, have been closed, moved or are under severe contraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closure of Thorn means that the units that have been built in the community—the brand-new units at the Pentrebach business park, for example, which were to create future employment opportunities for our young people—wilol have to be used immediately to fill the gap that has been created by the closure. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
business park contains units that are capable of providing 550 jobs. Now desperately needed, the units have to be filled and promoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is at least approachable, and I have spoken to him. I have also spent much time with the Welsh Development Agency. I know that the district and county councils will do all that they can. We need to spread the message to the four corners of the world, if need be, that we have the best piece of industrial real estate in south Wales in the centre of Merthyr Tydfil, and that opportunity lies there. We must promote that message with all speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What message should we carry? What should the Secretary of State say when he goes to north America? What should I, the WDA and others say to encourage companies to come and invest in Merthyr? I believe that it is the greatest place in the world, but others may take a different view. I can present my industrial tourist brochure with ease, emphasising Merthyr's great location and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from those who have travelled to Japan, Korea and other countries that managing directors of great international conglomerates do not ask about Government grants so much these days. They do not ask even about trade union relations. Instead, they ask about the skills of the people in the community. That is now the No. 1 question. Our people have skills, and that is what will attract investors into the units at Pentrebach and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the valley communities do not believe in, and are increasingly worried about, the concentration of development along the so-called M4 corridor. We wish to make it abundantly clear that valley communities do not want to be dormitory towns to Bridgend, LLantrisant or Cardiff. We have an economy that is capable of development within our own communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve that objective, skills and training are bound to be at the heart of the argument. The Secretary of State said that he was not complacent generally, but he is utterly complacent about training in the Principality, especially in south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training has been one of the most serious victims of the past 10 years. Inevitably, the myopic views of employers about the value of training have had a bad effect. Many training workshops that operated inside companies have been closed or rapidly contracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Merthyr technical college, only about a dozen young people are taking the B Tech in national engineering, which is equivalent to the old ordinary national diploma, and pursuing that course in the second and third year. In one of the major education and training institutions of my constituency, only about two dozen are involved in British national engineering technical training programmes. The figures are astonishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an enormous worry to us all. There was a time in the south Wales valleys when apprenticeships were provided by the gas board, the electricity board and the National Coal Board. The only private employer which had a substantial training
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
programme was South Wales Switchgear. Since the privatisation of public bodies, those organisations are not training. With the Government's daft proposal to switch training enterprise allowances from community-based training workshops to management-based workshops, there is now another collapse in training in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends make a valid point about the training base, upon which I shall enlarge. There is a vicious circle. With the decline of manufacturing, there is also a decline in training opportunities for manufacturing. If training is to be employer-based—that is the theme of the Government's text—can we be told who the employers are who will train? Even Thorn is training only three or four young people, and it is due to close. Where will the manufacturing training base be established for building new skills in engineering and modern manufacturing production techniques?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are inclined to be pre-occupied with youth unemployment and training, but I am desperately worried about middle-age unemployment. Perhaps that is because I am nearer to middle age myself. I do not intend to be unemployed in the near future—even in his wildest dreams, the Secretary of State does not think that I shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the problems of middle-age unemployment, for a generation of 30 and 40-year-olds. An analysis by Merthyr technical college of 634 people who were recently unemployed showed that 400 over 26 years and up to 50 had no qualifications of any sort. The reason is simple: the members of that generation found jobs easy to come by. They left school and went straight into work because it was available. Most of the jobs did not involve training, and so they obtained a job quickly. They are now the members of the most vulnerable group in terms of potential unemployment and redundancy. They have experience, but no qualifications or skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we find when we describe the need for training and match it with what the Government and the TECs are offering? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) said, the Government behave absurdly. They have decided that no one who is older than 24 may be trained unless he has been on the dole for two years. Secondly, no one under 24 may be trained unless he has been on the dole for six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training programmes do not anticipate community needs. There is not one training programme from the Mid Glamorgan TEC that reaches out to 30 and 40year-olds who are in employment but have no qualifications. There is no sign of such a programme. When we propose a scheme, the TEC says that what we propose does not fit into current programmes. In other words, the structure of training on offer does not, and will not, match the needs of our community. The Secretary of State must take a harder look at the nature, structure and funding of training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Training is central to the valleys initiative. The Secretary of State's predecessor, the right hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
for Worcester (Mr. Walker) is a smart politician with an immaculate sense of timing. He got out of Slater Walker with a minute to spare. In 1987, he went into the Secretary of State's office just at the right time—at the peak of an assumed boom with rising employment—and left it with a minute to spare, just as the boom began to burst and unemployment started to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During his time as Secretary of State he launched the valleys initiative in the context of assumed growth and declining unemployment. Two years later, the present Secretary of State picked up the valleys initiative in the completely different context of rising unemployment and no growth in the valleys' economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman cannot pretend that that initiative, as defined, can match and sustain the needs and demands of a changed national context. It needs bolstering, redefining and refinancing. That is my message to the Secretary of State from the families of Merthyr Tydfil whose fathers will lose their jobs in Hoover and whose mothers will lose their jobs in Thorn. It is a community that has had an historic role in the industrial development of Wales. It wishes to continue that role into the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I listened with sadness to what the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) said about unemployment in Wales.

The Merthyr area, which adjoins my constituency, is an unemployment disaster area. I hope sincerely that the Secretary of State will assist the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in his attempt to solve the massive problems there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is suffering from the effects of a recession that is of the Government's making. We cannot get away from that. The right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson), the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, has bene mentioned, as have his misjudgments on the economy in 1987 and 1988 which he boosted for the richest people by more than £2 billion. That fuelled the inflation that all of us now have to pay for and from which the Prime Minister is trying to pick up the pieces. Inflation went out of control and was followed by swingeing increase in interest rates which have had a disastrous effect on the British economy, and on the Welsh economy especially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manufacturing, small businesses and farming have been affected. No farm enterprise has been able to show a return on any enterprise during the past three years. This has been disastrous for the economy of mid Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
High interest rates have brought mortgage misery and taken an enormous amount from the Welsh economy. This has resulted in less spending ability for the Welsh people which, in turn, has contributed to the downturn in the economy. Sadly, the banks have misused their power with interest rates. All of us know of many instances of banks not having reduced their interest rates quickly enough after the Government reduced them. I hope that the Secretary of State has input into the Cabinet, which should put pressure on banks to toe the line and charge rates compatible with his Government's policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment has shown its effects. The hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) gave the Committee figures. Suffice to say that 112,000 Welsh people are unemployed. The unadjusted figure for March is 108,000: that shows an increase of 4,000 unemployed from March to May, which can be set against a background of job vacancies that are down by 2.5 per cent compared with last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The black spots are the valleys. I mentioned Merthyr Tydfil, but let us not forget that British Coal has closed other colleries such as Blaenant, which adjoins my constituency, where there has been a serious loss of almost 600 jobs. One hundred and twenty miners were employed in that pit in the community of Ystradgynlais in my community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deep mining is being replaced by opencast mining. On the Nant Helen site in my constituency, 65 men are about to lose their jobs because of the archaic system of contracting out by British Coal, which is behaving like a 19th century mogul and showing no respect for the integrity of its employees. British Coal promised to employ 140 local people in the Nant Helen site. The contractors at that site are about to sell out on 65 local people, which will leave 28 local people employed there. Yet one of British Coal's jewels in the crown, which is stated in applications for new opencast sites, is that it will employ local people. That seems hollow considering what happens in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thee are also cuts in the electronics industry, and firms such as A.B. Electronics have been mentioned. In agriculture, there has been a massive increase in unemployment and associated knock-on effects in the Welsh rural economy, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) said. Unemployment is back on the Welsh agenda. That cancerous virus should be attacked now, before it goes completely out of control, as it has done in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Low wages are another major problem in the Welsh economy, which we cannot ignore. The gross domestic product per head of people in the four Welsh rural counties is 87 per cent of the European average. Disposable income in Wales is 86 per cent of the United Kingdom average. In 1990, that amounted to £4,644 for every person in Wales, as against the United Kingdom average of £5,383. More than half the Welsh work force earn less than £10,000 per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent adverts for jobs in Swansea, junior hairdressers were offered £40 a week, legal audio typists £5,000 a year, catering assistant managers £5,500 a year, office managers £8,000 a year. Many of my constituents earn £60, £70 or £80 a week. That is disgraceful in the 1990s, and it must be tackled. There are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
428,000 people in Wales who earn less than £10,000 a year. People on such incomes find it difficult to live, buy food and have roofs over their heads.

Of course, we welcome the work done by the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. Inward investment must be welcomed, but it does not always create quality employment. There are promising signs, such as the investment by Bosch. That investment might create more skilled jobs. The new investment by Sony seems as though it will bring more research and development into Wales, which is sparse at the moment.

Quality employment and higher wages are needed to improve the quality of life in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the nature of the employment that is provided is important, because the strong, active young men who are forced to leave employment in agriculture do not adapt easily to jobs that involve fitting a screw in a component on a production line? Does he also agree that the sociological factors of the decline in agriculture must be taken into account when new industry is urged to come to rural Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that timely intervention. In our constituencies and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Howells), the present state of agriculture is such that even single sons leave family farm holdings to seek employment. It is necessary to retrain people in those areas and thus attract a wider diversity of jobs. It is also necessary to introduce part-time employment for members of family farms in rural areas, who experience difficulties in finding jobs. That would boost the incomes of those families and enable them to stay in the family units that have existed for centuries. The privatisation of industry, especially service industries, in Wales should serve as a cautionary tale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. There is a down side to a national minimum wage—our party has debated it. The matter could be tackled by a combined tax and benefits systems, which would take earnings into account, and could be adjusted to ensure that those who are in a low-wage bracket could be assisted. Their disposable incomes would thus be increased.

British Telecom, and the water, electricity and gas industries have been privatised in Wales. The increase in the price of those products affect not only the domestic budget but industry. The price of water has increased by 16 per cent per annum, as a result of Government formulae. As the Director General of Water Services said yesterday, the water industry should be brought under greater control. Water com-

panies should become statutory companies so that more of their profits could be used to reduce consumer bills and to invest more in environmentally-sound schemes to clean up our rivers and beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fixed costs paid by ordinary people have increased as a result of privatisations. Services have also been removed. Midlands Electricity intends to close its shop in Knighton. Consequently, 13,000 of my constituents will have to travel to Ludlow and Leominster to find an electricity shop. I have reported Midlands Electricity to the Director General of Fair Trading for such an abuse of its monopoly position. In Builth, South Wales Electricity will open its shop on only two days a week. I shall take action against South Wales Electricity. The privatised electricity industry deprives ordinary people of services while making massive profits. They use the shops as cost centres in order to close them. That is hijack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remedies for the Welsh economy are lower itnerest rates, greater control of inflation, and more investment in industry and in infrastructure. Liberal Democrats believe in a mixed economy. One cannot achieve a sound economy without priming the pump of public investment.

I am disappointed that the Secretary of State announced road schemes for south and north Wales but a cut in investment in road schemes for mid Wales. What will happen to the A470 and the north-south link? Improving roads in mid Wales should be on the Government's agenda.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct.

A matter that has dismayed me in the debate is the lack of forward looking by both major parties. Two major developments could boost the Welsh economy—a greater commitment to the European Community and the creation of a Welsh Parliament. They could move it into the next century. We must embrace a single currency and the federal concept in the European Community. The Secretary of State may believe in those proposals, but he has been restrained by his party. He made a supportive speech in Swansea, but members of his party are making reverse comments about Europe, and that is a great shame because the future of Wales depends on those factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also dismayed that the Secretary of State has rejected the concept of a Welsh Assembly, because that could release the energies of the people of Wales. It was similarly depressing to note that the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) did not commit himself to the creation of a Welsh Assembly within the first five years in office of a Labour Government. That was very revealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither party is giving full commitment to both those objectives, which would solve the problems of the Welsh economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes, for calling me to contribute to the debate. This is the first time that I have been a member of the Welsh Grand Committee, and I am present, of course, because of the sad death of my predecessor, Sir John Stradling Thomas. I know that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee found him a calm, popular man and are saddened by his death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For several years, I listened to many of the debates in the Committee from the Public Gallery, and that greatly contributed to my knowledge and understanding of Welsh affairs. It gave me the determination to become a member of the Committee, and I am happy to have suceeded as a result of the Monmouth by-election. The issues of the economy, the recession and rural affairs that we are discussing should be debated every day rather than every month or two, so I hope that we can have a Welsh Parliament in which we can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the honour to represent the Monmouth constituency because of the famous by-election about a month ago. Monmouth is one of the most anglicised areas of Wales. It was often regarded as one of the most affluent rural and, until last month, Conservative areas of Wales. It is no longer a Conservative area, and I trust that that will remain so for some time. Unfortunately, we have a Conservative local authority in Monmouth, though that may change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying theme of the by-election was the subject of our debate—the effects of the recession on rural areas. From the people I spoke to in Abergavenny, Chepstow, Monmouth and elsewhere, many of whom were not natural Labour supporters, the consistent theme that emerged was the Government's economic mismanagement and social irresponsibility. Many people said that they would vote for me because the Government had gone too far. That opinion was reflected in the outcome of the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
There were significant changes in the Welsh economy in the 1980s. There was not a transformation or an economic miracle, but there were changes, including the decline of the coal and steel industries, the growth of the service sector and new technology industries. I acknowledge the success of interventionist Government policy and the role of the Welsh Development Agency and other agencies that have acted as an antidote to the Government's free market, laissez-faire approach to economic management over the past 12 years, for there was a steady fall in unemployment in the 1980s. Local authorities built new economic development strategies. I give credit to Gwent county council for its forward-looking economic development strategy. I wish, however, that that strategy had not been sabotaged by the recession, which has hit hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must criticise some of the attitudes of organisations such as the WDA. The WDA is mostly interested in the development of private business rather than the development of Wales as a whole. The WDA has an unbalanced economic remit and an insufficient social remit. It has not been sufficiently interested in the issues of poverty and low pay. Concepts such as poverty, social deprivation and social inequality have been part of the forbidden vocabulary of the Welsh Office and the WDA over the past 12 years—the truth about social inequality and poverty must not be mentioned because it would tarnish the image of Wales for visiting delegations from Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the progress that was made has been sabotaged by the Treasury's mismanagement of the economy. The National Institute of Social and Economic Research recently stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Britain is suffering from the recession to a greater extent than other European economies because of policy mistakes in the late 1980s."</p></blockquote>
Those mistakes include rapid expansion, over-generous tax reductions for the well off, a consumer credit boom and the boom-and-bust philosophy that has governed economic management over the past four or five years and for which the whole country is now paying the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the report by the Cardiff Business School for the survey of the Institute of Directors. I have read that report and drew rather different conclusions from it. Sixty per cent of companies reported lower profits in the past six months; 58 per cent reported that the volume of their business was down. On average, Welsh firms were working at 70 per cent capacity; 20 per cent of firms were utilising 50 per cent or less of their capacity; 34 per cent of companies were less optimistic about their future business prospects. Only 27 per cent were more optimistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effects of the recession—recession it must be called—are most clearly seen in the rise in unemployment. My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn Deeside (Mr. Jones) has given the official figures; 112,400 people in Wales are unemployed, which is 8.7 per cent. of the work force. Making allowance for the 30-odd changes in the way the figures are calculated would add an extra 50 per cent. Probably a better estimate is 169,000. That is 13.8 per cent. of the work force. It is a great sadness to us all that the official figures include
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
40,300 people under the age of 25 and 5,000 under the age of 18 who have had unemployment benefit withdrawn at a stroke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment in Wales has increased by 36 per cent. since May 1990. In my constituency, the unemployment rate has increased by 44 per cent. in the past 12 months. That is 2,000 people paying a price—but a price well worth paying? Those people worked hard, were enterprising, thought that they lived in an affluent area and were part of an economic miracle. Yet, as a result of the Government's economic mismanagement, they find growing firms going bust. I have spoken to people running building firms in Abergavenny and Chepstow and heard the sad story of building firms going out of business because of the Governments high interest rate policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the recession in my constituency, as in many other constituencies, is felt in manufacturing and service industries, and especially in agriculture. There is nothing more sad than to hear people saying that there is no hope of their sons or daughters following the family tradition and going into farming. That is caused partly by the Government's agricultural policy and partly because of general economic mismanagement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not do the 2,000 people in my constituency and the 112,000 people in Wales have to suffer only the indignity of being unemployed, redundant or bankrupt, they also have to suffer the indignity of living on unemployment benefit and income support under a Government who have used the unemployed as scapegoats for the economic ills of the 1980s and penalised them accordingly.

One book that I read as a student, and which I talked about when I was a lecturer, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The state spends all its energies taking money from the energetic, successful and thrifty to give to the idle, the failures and the feckless."</p></blockquote>
That book was written by the hon. Member for Brent, South, who gave it the title "Down with the poor". I detested everything in that book, but it has been a great inspiration to me. I looked forward to the opportunity of speaking about that book when I took my seat in the House. Of course, no one will come to Abergavenny, Chepstow and Monmouth to tell the 2,000 people who are are now out of work that they are idle, feckless failures. The tragedy is that the author of that book was made a Minister at the then Department of Health and Social Security, and it was he who initiated the 1986 changes in the social security system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Social Security Act 1988 introduced the most punitive social security change since the measures
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
introduced by the National Government at the height of the depression in the 1930s, and many families in south Wales had first hand experience of it. The Act abolished unemployment benefit for those under 18, reduced it for those under 25 and introduced the social fund. It was part of a strategy to penalise people because they were unemployed, and there is evidence of that strategy throughout the social security system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done their best to reduce the value of benefits—the abolition of the long-term addition is one example. They changed eligibility rules and introduced a punitive form of administration. They introduced the actively seeking work test and extended the disqualification period for those deemed to be voluntarily out of work, disqualifying people from benefit because they refused to take intolerably low paid jobs. The people who are suffering now did not imagine that they would be victims of the present social security system. They thought that they were in an economic miracle only two or three years ago and the worst is not over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, is here to listen to my speech. He and his colleagues in the No Turning Back group say that state benefits should be converted gradually into a private insurance system. Their policy document, "Choice and Responsibility", states that most citizens would be required to insure themselves for their old age, sickness, ill health and unemployment. The document also states that if an able bodied person was unable or unwilling at any time to pay the prescribed premium, the state would pay it in return for work. That is coercion to contribute to private insurance. If that is not opting out, what is? It amounts to abandoning the national insurance system as we know it and completely dismantling the welfare state? I repeat an earlier phrase: the Under-Secretary would give his eye teeth to see the proposals implemented. The Secretary of State claims that the Government are not divided on the issue. Would he, too, give his eye teeth to see the proposals implemented? I believe that only a Labour Government will reverse policies that are fundamentally hostile to the unemployed and to economic regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the work of Gwent county council in economic development. It is committed to full employment and to raising wage levels. One in five women in Gwent earns less than £120 a week. Some people think that that is too generous and do not want it raised by even £10 to £130 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the economic regeneration that the second Severn bridge will bring to Gwent and to south Wales. However, there should be better infrastructure and improvements to the heads of the valleys roads and railway services from Pontypool to Newport. A minimum wage should be introduced that would raise the wages of 70,000 women and 35,000 men in Wales
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However hard the Prime Minister tries to rediscover his ancestry in Monmouth and to redefine his ideology in Swansea, he is central to the economic destruction of major parts of Wales and to the humiliation that is suffered by many unemployed people as a result of the social security system.

I have listened carefully to the debate this morning. Everyone expects us to have a balanced, two-sided debate on the important matter of the Welsh economy. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State started with a balanced contribution and stressed the positive features that exist and those that are needed. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) followed in the same vein, but an unbiased observer outside would not conclude that the contributions from other members of the Committee had been balanced. I can but hope that they will improve as the day goes on.

It is ironic that such criticism often comes from those who would foist on us a second-class Welsh Grand Committee, which would sit permanently in Wales, cost £1 million a week before it took any action, and dilute the power of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales in the Cabinet and in the Government. How can they square that with their criticism?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it was the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley), who is not now in his place, who said that there was less than a year to go until the next general election. Should not the hon.

Surely we have a right to expect him to argue the positive side of his case and to say what he would need to achieve and how he would do it. There was a conspicuous absence of positive contributions. The hon. Gentleman started by being unusually congratulatory and complimentary about good news and even added to my right hon. Friend's list by giving his own good news, but we then

had the usual negative ranting to which we have become accustomed from the Labour Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the vision of tomorrow can be seen in the reality of today just a little to the north-east of the principality of Wales in Liverpool where a Labour council leader is scuttling around the streets trying to avoid the council's employees, as well as the "real" Labour party. That is the reality of what the Labour party would deliver if it ever came to pass that it formed a Government. It is like the Bourbons of France—it learns nothing and forgets nothing. It would give us the worst of all worlds and all the excesses from Merseyside to Hackney. However, I espy a consolation. We know from elections in London that the London Labour factor works to the advantage of the Conservative party in London, and I fancy that that is happening in South Wales also. Whenever the Luddite Left, which is increasingly dominant in the Labour party of Wales, speaks and advances ideas to thwart the Welsh economy, there are faint stirrings that it will add 500 votes for the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do yesterday's men offer? Do they offer the white heat of technology? No. They offer yesterday's policies of higher inflation, higher unemployment and, once more, a regional assembly for Wales—all the old, failed policies.

Frankly, I wonder whether members of the Labour party and the Shadow Front Bench meet potential inward investors. If so, what do they say to them? We gather that the Shadow Chancellor and his colleague the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) have been doing the rounds on the prawn cocktail circuit in London, but they say different things to the City of London from what they say to others. That is a two-handed approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message going out to the City of London is that the Labour party has learnt its lessons and that there will be no more wild spending. I can only imagine that the Labour party in Wales is not speaking to potential inward investors because, if it is, it is not being taken seriously. In the catchphrase of Max Boyce, the reaction from potential inward investors when Labour speaks in Wales is that they are only joking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We can point to a commendable record of success in inward investment. Surely that record of success displays the faith that the rest of the world has in the Welsh economy. It totally refutes the endless doom and gloom that is being advanced from the Opposition. I suppose that they have good reason to talk doom and gloom. Les Miserables opposite or, perhaps I should

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about gloom, but is it not a matter for gloom that unemployment in his constituency has risen by 55 per cent during the last year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman leads me to an interesting point that I shall touch on strongly in a moment or two when he may be sorry that he made that intervention.

It is universally acknowledged that perhaps there was an over-reaction to the interest rate cuts of 1987 and 1988, but it was the Opposition who demanded that we should go further and faster in cutting interest rates. They continue to demand that. The Opposition have no sense of economic reality and are motivated only by a desire for popularity. The Opposition believe that they can achieve such popularity cheaply, but in reality it would be grievously expensive if they ever had the opportunity. Frankly, I believe that they know that they will never be in that position because anybody who has any responsibility towards the economy would never make such calls, regardless of the obvious consequences for inflation and for the pound.

I now turn to the point made by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). The most obvious effect of the Labour party's policies for Wales—if it ever formed a Government—would be a massive increase in unemployment. Already, several references have been made today but, surely, all Members of the Committee privately, if not publicly, are agreed that unemployment is too high. However, Opposition Members still insist on pursuing policies that will assuredly drive it far higher. They are committed to a new jobs tax and, worse still, they would implement in its entirety the European Commission's social action programme which, at the very least, would cost 5,000 more lost jobs in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party also wants to introduce social audits that would enshrine in company decisions social as well as economic reasons, at extra cost to companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain how creating better conditions for workers and giving people equal opportunities and more participation in the work process will cost them their jobs. That has not happened in Germany, where a high level of social action in employment is accompanied by enhanced productivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised, and even amazed, that the hon. Gentleman still clings to such outdated ideas, which are refuted on every count by impartial and other sources. In addition to the social audits which the Labour party would impose, it also plans a new Act on sex equality, and to increase employers' obligations to give time off for trade union activities.

	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
The single biggest contribution to increased unemployment, if ever the Labour party came to power, would be its policy of a minimum wage. I say to the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) and to all other Opposition Members that they do not have to take my word for it. The hon. Gentleman should talk to Mr. Eric Hammond of the Electrical, Electronic, Tele-communications and Plumbing Union, and he would tell him how much unemployment he thinks that a minimum wage would create. He should talk to the Amalgamated Engineering Workers Union, and it will tell him how much unemployment it would create. The hon. Gentleman might even talk to his hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who has said that Labour's policy of a minimum wage would lead to greatly increased unemployment—that view is perhaps one more reason why the hon. Member for Birkenhead is likely to be deselected in Liverpool this weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going beyond the policies that will increase unemployment there is Labour's old favourite of nationalisation—particularly of the water industry, although I imagine that, by implication, everything that is now owned by people would be nationalised. Labour Members loyally trooped through the Division Lobby to vote against each privatisation Bill. Where will the money come from to nationalise—for the sake of dogma—such important industries? The Welsh water authority is spending more than ever before, investing in improved water and sewerage services for Wales. Will the money to fund its nationalisation come from slashing its massive investment programme, from the taxpayer or from the International Monetary Fund?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of Labour's plan for spending needs to be stated to be fully understood. The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has said that the implementation of each measure must wait until there are sufficient resources to pay for it. In other words, Labour will boost growth by spending more, but the spending must wait until the growth has been boosted. It is not logical. It is little wonder that Nomura Securities, which has important Japanese connections that are relevant to Wales, has costed Labour's programme. It estimates that unemployment would rise massively under Labour, that interest rates would increase by 5 per cent to 16 per cent, and that the public sector borrowing requirement would rise to £28 billion. The only thing that it estimates would be reduced under Labour would be the value of the pound. If we had the time and the opportunity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that that forecast was completely discredited in the City and is not backed up by any other serious, credible forecasts or statistics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting claim, but it is without foundation. He will have to catch your eye, Mr. Hughes, to try to develop the argument. Nomura Securities is increasingly supported by other organisations, as they discover what Labour's policies are. The Labour party has been working hard to keep its policies concealed.

It would be interesting to learn in Committee today how many more people in Wales would have to spend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
more in taxation if the Labour party formed the next Government. The hon. Member for Derby, South said that the figure would be one in 20. The Leader of the Opposition says that it would be one in 18. The shadow Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith), says that it would be one in eight. Such is the antipathy that the Labour party has for the Welsh water authority, which is making a major contribution to the improvement of the Welsh economy, that it would probably claim in public that only John Elfed Jones would have to pay more tax. The reality is that the basic rate of taxation would increase 15p in the pound to 40 per cent.

In the past, I have expressed concern about the consequences of increasing interest rates. I am glad that interest rates are now coming down and are very
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
likely to continue doing so. I am much aware of the need to proceed prudently. I applaud the fact that the rate of inflation is plummeting. That is the single most important factor in improving the economy. Additionally, and importantly, we need the right attitude and the right spirit. The Welsh economy is not perfect but that is not unique—across the world, many other countries are also enduring the downturn that is being suffered by the Welsh economy. However, with minimum inflation and the right spirit, we can go forward. The present decade will be one of real growth for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
