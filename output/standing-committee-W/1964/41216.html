	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. James Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Lady Megan, on behalf of every Member of the Committee, how pleased we are to see you in the Chair to preside over our deliberations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of the functions of the Secretary of State for Wales and constitutional changes in Wales and Monmouthshire.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Keith Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I associate my right hon. and hon. Friends with the welcome to you, Lady Megan, as Chairman of the Welsh Grand Committee and say how much we welcome the combination of firmness and charm we are sure to receive from you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before embarking on the debate, it would be appropriate if we referred, sometimes with joy and sometimes with a certain sadness, to changes in the composition of the Committee. It strikes an odd note to see the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) in the body of the Committee. We congratulate him on his promotion. We wish him well while he sorts out the problems of Sabbatarianism and licensing and other subjects for which he has been made responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee also welcome the new Members, although in the case of the hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams), naturally my hon. Friends and I regret the loss of Hugh Rees who played such a large part in our activities before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would all like to say how much our minds are dominated these days by the floods in Wales and we congratulate the Secretary of State on the obvious trouble he has personally taken to see the extent
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
of the flooding. We welcome the assurance of the Minister of State in the House yesterday that the right hon. Gentleman will report to the House as soon as he knows the extent of the damage when the water has receded and what action needs to be and is being taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we congratulate the Secretary of State personally on his assumption of the great office he now holds. Wales has a Secretary of State who is widely respected, and we shall give him ample time this morning to explain the exact meaning of the functions for which he is now responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the post-war devolution of power to Wales starts with the work of my right hon. Friends when they took office in 1951. The post-war Labour Government took no steps whatsoever to devolve administrative powers to Wales. It was in 1951 that my right hon. Friends created the post of Minister for Welsh Affairs in fulfilment of their election pledge and it was not until 1954, two and a half years after the first Minister for Welsh Affairs had been appointed by the Conservatives, that the Labour Party proposed that there should be a Secretary of State. Now, thirteen years after the Tories first created the office of Minister for Welsh Affairs, the Labour Government have fulfilled their pledge of the mid-nineteen-fifties to create the office of Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are a number of questions arising from this appointment. What we and, I am sure, all hon. Members want to know is what powers the right hon. Gentleman has. The Prime Minister, in announcing to the House the functions of the new office, used words which seemed to indicate that the Secretary of State does not even have all the executive responsibilities of his Tory predecessor. The Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He will now take over virtually all the executive responsibilities of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in Wales."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th November, 1964; Vol. 602. c. 623.]</p></blockquote>
Those words were repeated by the Secretary of State himself in an interview with Mr. David Rosser, reported in the 	<i>Western Mail</i> on 1st December. The right hon. Gentleman is reported as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that the transfer of executive functions to the Secretary of State will cover
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
virtually the whole of the work of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government."</p></blockquote>
We would like to know from the right hon. Gentleman what is the significance of the word "virtually". For instance, we assume that he will be responsible for the housing function which has until now been within the scope of the Minister of Housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh Affairs. No doubt the right hon. Gentleman will confirm that. We assume that he is now responsible for the Ministerial work in connection with local government, and would like to know whether that includes local government reorganisation, local government finance and rating. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give us answers on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note that in response to questions the right hon. Gentleman has said that he is still considering the proposals that he should make in connection with Welsh local government reform and that he is contemplating the issue of a White Paper. The Committee will be aware that the previous Administration had committed themselves to the publication of a White Paper which would make proposals for the reorganisation of Welsh local authorities in terms not only of boundaries but of functions. We would be grateful if he would tell us that his White Paper will also cover both functions and boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like to know more about his responsibilities for housing. The Committee will be aware that the Welsh Office has in the past few years mobilised a great increase in the momentum of Welsh housing. We would like to be assured that the right hon. Gentleman will himself be responsible for maintaining this momentum and will have the power to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of water. We would like to know whether the previous responsibility of the holder of the Ministry of Welsh Affairs in co-ordination with the Ministry of Housing and Local Government is continued in the case of water. In Opposition, the Labour Party made great play with the need for a Welsh water resources board. We would like to know what the present position is. Is the right hon. Gentleman responsible for water in Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us noticed the reply of the First Secretary of State in response to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Questions by my hon. Friend the Member for the City of Chester (Mr. Temple), who asked whether the Secretary of State for Wales would take over the powers of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for water in Wales. The First Secretary of State replied that he thought it highly improbable that these things were being considered. We hope that the Secretary of State will tell us today what the position is regarding water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note that he is to be responsible for town planning functions of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in Wales, and we have no quarrel with this, but we would like to know more about the interplay of town and country planning and economic planning. As the Committee will be aware, the late Administration had set up a survey and redevelopment section of the Welsh Office to carry out, in conjunction with the then Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, a plan for Wales. We note that the link between the Welsh Office and the central economic planning mechanism is no longer with a Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, but with the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. This is not in itself, as far as we can see at first sight, disturbing, but we want to know whether the Welsh Office will maintain a survey and redevelopment section, that the work already done will not be wasted, that plans will be issued for Wales and the five divisions of Wales—although these are not sacred—as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want to know the present state of play about the famous new town. We do not want to make life awkward for the right hon. Gentleman, but we know that, whereas unanimity prevails on practically everything on the other side of the Committee, there are some differences of opinion about this. The first thing the right hon. Gentleman said on accepting office was that he would have a new town for Wales. That may or may not have been welcome to all his hon. Friends. No doubt we shall hear about it today. But is this a decision he is actively pursuing at the moment? Is it in his mind that the occupants of this new or expanded town will come from congested industrial cities of England
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
or from the already depopulated areas of mid-Wales? We should like to hear something about this and the parts which he and the First Secretary of State are playing in all this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the right hon. Gentleman has been given powers over roads, both trunk and urban, in Wales. We see nothing in this to criticise in itself, but does he think that he will be able to maintain the highly favourable ratio of spending on roads by which the expenditure on roads per head of population in Wales has, over the last few years, been so very much higher than expenditure per head in the United Kingdom as a whole and England in particular?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask him to clarify the obscure words of the Prime Minister about a Welsh Vote. What is the position there? We are not saying that a Vote for the Welsh Office is in itself the final criterion of the effectiveness of the Office, but we think we should know as soon as possible what the position is, and we ask the Secretary of State whether he thinks that, with his new and smaller hat for Wales, he will be able to keep the disproportionate share of the total road expenditure that Wales has enjoyed until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note with some surprise that, despite categorical assurances in "Signposts for the New Wales" that executive responsibility for health, agriculture and education would be transferred under a Labour Government to the new Secretary of State, the right hon. Gentleman has no such executive responsibility. We note that he has been given the honour of replying on some occasions for other Ministers whose executive responsibility in Wales remains unimpaired by the creation of his new office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like some explanation, and we think that the electorate will want some, of why, after thirteen years in Opposition, when the Labour Party made categorical promises, the Government have, so early in this case, completely broken them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We note that, whereas in Opposition, the Labour Party was always saying how vital it was that Wales should have control of her own economic sinews—that is, powers which go with the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Power, and, par-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
ticularly in connection with railways and docks, the Ministry of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, in office, the Secretary of State has no more power over trade, transport—except for roads—and power than his Tory predecessors. We do not think that this is a wrong decision. We think that in rail transport, trade and power the U.K. as a whole is the economic unit, and we always said so. We would be glad to know why the Government, having maintained for thirteen years contrary opinions while in Opposition, have so quickly swallowed their own words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It all adds up to this: the Secretary of State has a splendid new title, on which we congratulate him, but he has not as much power as his predecessor, the Minister for Welsh Affairs who was also the Minister of Housing and Local Government, because, by his own admission and that of the Prime Minister, he only has virtually all the powers of the Minister of Housing and Local Government in Wales. We note that he has none of the executive powers of the other Ministries which were promised to the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to all this the Secretary of State will, no doubt, tell us that all this is offset by the fact that now for the first time the Minister for Welsh Affairs, renamed the Secretary of State for Welsh Affairs, has a seat in the Cabinet exclusively on Welsh matters. I ask the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends to reflect whether this implies a larger effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are essentially matters of personality as well as of power. No one would deny the right hon. Gentleman his full share of personality and certainly passion for Welsh matters, and I should like to leave altogether the personal aspects. No one should underrate the importance of weight, in terms of the constant importance to other Ministers, of a Cabinet office. Until now, the Minister concerned with Wales, the Minister for Welsh Affairs as he was called, always doubled the office with that of another major State Department. On both counts, he was sure to have his views very fully considered at all stages in the formation of national policy. This is being replaced by a situation in which the Minister concerned, whatever his personality and his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
personal qualities, does not have a Ministry which is large or whose work is essential to the functioning, in almost all their spheres, of the other Ministries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Secretary of State to tell us whether he does not agree that there is some risk that Welsh affairs will not get the same effective voice in the Cabinet, and will not, to put it crudely, have the same bargaining power, which the Minister for Welsh Affairs had in previous Administrations. I ask him to reflect on the disproportionate share of total national expenditure on Welsh roads and tell us whether he thinks that he can keep up that record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want the right hon. Gentleman to have ample time to reply to some of our questions and I am sure that my hon. Friends will have many more. I will sum up my case by these last words: Wales has a widely respected Minister with a sonorous new title, but his powers have been cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) for his very kindly personal remarks. I look forward to many years of seeing him display his great gifts in Opposition. We all recognise his gifts and talents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by associating myself with the right hon. Gentleman and with all hon. Members in our sympathy to the people of Wales, particularly in mid and north-west Wales, who have suffered so grievously from the floods this week. I felt that it was my duty as well as my privilege to make as quick a visit as I could, though it involved travelling in a helicopter. It was very difficult to find anywhere to land, but we were able to visit Newtown. My hon. Friend the Minister of State made a statement yesterday and I promise the Committee, as he promised the House, that as soon as we have the information necessary to estimate the damage, we shall make a statement in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, let me pay tribute to all those who are working so well, to the emergency arrangements and to the courage of the people. The Committee may allow me to cite one instance which illustrates the spirit in which the people have approached—I will not say a disaster for all, but a terrible ordeal. I went to a house in Newtown where
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the water the day before had been 6 ft. deep. Fortunately, the Severn receded very quickly, almost as quickly as it rose. The water had been baled out of the house and there, in colliers' language, was the muck. I expressed my sympathy—and back came the answer from a good workman: "There it is; it has all happened now; there is nothing to do but tidy it up." That is their spirit and I pay my tribute to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to set out as clearly as I can the functions and responsibilities which I have taken over with this office, but first I want to say a few words about the Opposition's attitude to the Labour Party programme. It is intriguing that this morning we should be told that we are not carrying out our programme, when tomorrow we shall be begged, or whatever it may be, not to do so. The Opposition's attitude is very interesting. I hope that the country will recognise its inconsistency, whatever may be ours, and will appreciate that hon. Members opposite are anxious that we should carry out some parts of our programme in full and at once and are desperately anxious that other parts should not be introduced at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me begin what I have to say by stating how I have always approached this problem. For many years, there has been a continuing debate in Wales about the relationship between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. There has been a wide desire, not confined to one party and not satisfied by whatever arrangements previous Administrations have made, for a fuller recognition of our nationhood and of a new status for Wales within the constitution of the United Kingdom. This feeling has been very widespread. We are an old nation for whom the imponderables mean much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hops that the right hon. Gentleman will understand that this is one of the things which have convinced many people that whatever the arrangements were before, and however good or bad they might be, they did not fulfil this deeply felt desire to have Wales recognised. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has gone a long way to meet this desire by appointing a Secretary of State for Wales for the first time. In case there should be any misunderstanding, my title is not Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
for Welsh Affairs, but Secretary of State for Wales, with a seat in the Cabinet in virtue of the office. I believe that this has met with widespread approval in Wales and I am sure that, when the time comes, the electorate will express its gratitude to the Prime Minister for being the Prime Minister who went some way to meet this deeply felt desire to have Wales recognised, to have its own representative in the Cabinet to be the eyes and ears and voice of Wales. I am conscious of the honour done to me, the privilege given to me and the responsibility placed upon me for being permitted, in the twilight of my career, to be the first Secretary of State for Wales, and I can promise that I shall do my best for my country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to set out the arrangements as clearly as I can and in the course of doing so I hope that I shall deal with some of the right hon. Gentleman's questions. If he catches your eye, Lady Megan, my hon. Friend the Minister of State will later take up any questions with which I do not have time to deal. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if this morning I stick rather closer to my notes than is my custom, or habit by temperament. I shall do so in order to save time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to speak about the executive responsibilities which are transferred to me as Secretary of State for Wales. I have said, and I repeat what the Prime Minister has said, that I shall be taking over virtually all the executive responsibilities within Wales which hitherto have been the responsibility of the Minister of Housing and Local Government. This is a transfer of functions of major importance to Wales, for it touches policies and administration which have a vital relationship to the work and life of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Prime Minister announced, I shall be responsible for housing, town and country planning, organisation of local government, and new towns in Wales. This is a considerable devolution of adminstration. It is a transfer of functions from the existing Minister to the Secretary of State. When we use the term "virtual", it is because all these transferred functions will have to be embodied in a transfer of functions order. This is a matter of some complexity to which I shall refer later. In addition, I shall be taking over responsibility from
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the Minister of Transport for roads in Wales, including trunk roads in Wales. This is a function which naturally follows, because it is intimately linked with responsibility for town and country planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be necessary, as I have said, to have a transfer of functions order to give effect to these changes of responsibility, and the work of preparing the order is now under way. It involves careful examination of existing legislation to see precisely which powers are affected by the separation of responsibilities. There are many of these. Some can be geographically separated quite easily, while in other cases it is desirable to continue joint responsibility. I am sure that with his experience the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that this requires some care in drafting. All I can say at this stage is that the work of preparation of the transfer of functions order is proceeding as rapidly as possible. When it is laid before Parliament, the situation will be more clearly set out than I can state it this morning. I promise that no time will be lost in making these preparations. I cannot give a firm date yet, but the work is proceeding. I understand its complexity and the difficulty and the care needed in preparing it, but I am sure that those responsible will work with all due urgency to see that it can be announced as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman to say anything about water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As the Committee knows, a new Ministry has been set up, the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, and future responsibility for water is now being considered in the light of the setting up of the new Ministry. Consulations are taking place among my officials, those of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and those of the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources. The Prime Minister hopes to make a statement very shortly about the responsibilities for water in the light of the decisions reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the responsibilities to be transferred. I regard them as a very good beginning. I am very anxious in what time is left to me to make a success of this office. I am very anxious to lay the foundations. This is how our constitution works. We often start with small
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
beginnings and then the thing grows. It may be a matter of interest that I begin with more executive responsibilities than the Secretary of State for Scotland had when he began. This is exactly how the process works. We go from precedent to precedent. I am content to begin with the responsibilities which have been transferred to me and to make sure that we lay a sound foundation. For the rest of the devolution of administration, I am sure that, having made a good beginning and having laid a sound foundation, it will grow from year to year. That is my view and my hope. That is how things have happened in this country in years gone by, and that is how I think we shall continue in the years which lie ahead. Meantime, I regard it as my responsibility and duty to make a success of the administrative powers which have been given to me as Secretary of State for Wales, and to that end I shall devote myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to say a word about the separate Welsh Votes. In due course there will be separate Welsh Estimates to cover the expenditure on the functions which by then will have been transferred to me. I envisage that this will include three separate Votes dealing respectively with roads in Wales, with housing in Wales, and with the Welsh Office. I am not yet in a position to give the Committee an estimate of the total provision which will be necessary for this purpose in the financial year 1965–66.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have indicated, the actual responsibilities will be handed over as soon as the transfer of functions order takes effect. In the meantime it has been arranged, as a matter of accounting convenience, for the Ministries of Transport and Housing and Local Government to continue till the end of the present financial year to defray the charges under these Votes as if the functions had remained their responsibility. This is purely a temporary arrangement for accounting purposes. There will in due time be Welsh Estimates and a Welsh Vote. This means that for the first time we shall have a Welsh Vote, and I can see the Welsh Grand Committee conducting debates, as we have conducted debates in the House, on Supply, and I am sure
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
that my right hon. and hon. Friends will take the opportunity to air the grievances of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose now to say a word about the general grant and the rate deficiency grant. The right hon. Gentleman said—and if he looks up the debates on Wales he will note that I have said it, too—that we have been anxious to find a way by which Wales' desire for a Secretary of State and for the devolution of administrative responsibility should be made possible without severing the economic and social ties which for generations we have developed with the United Kingdom. My right hon. and hon. Friends know that this has been my view all along. I am Welsh enough to recognise that we must have a Secretary of State for Wales, that Wales desires this, and has a right to it. At the same time, because of my industrial experience, I have been anxious to secure this in a way which would ensure that Wales would not be taken out of the main stream of economic and social development. I believe that as a coal miner, as a M.P., and as Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a great deal of thought to the question of these two main grants, particularly in view of the fact, as announced by the Minister of Housing and Local Government yesterday, that in the course of the long Parliament which has just begun, we shall be considering the future of the financial arrangements with regard to local government. As my hon. Friends know, and as the right hon. Gentleman learned from his experience over rates—recently he had to provide first aid quite urgently—there is a problem here. The problem is the distribution of the burden for local government services between the central Government and local government. A radical study is being made of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that he instructed the Department in Wales to make a study of local government reorganisation. He rejected the report of the Commission, except with regard to towns. He allowed the normal procedure to take place there, but he instructed it to begin the task of examining local government in Wales from the standpoint not only of boundaries but of finance. When he says that a study of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
local government must include all those factors, I cordially agree with him, and I am sure that my hon. Friends, too, will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have come to the conclusion that in the meantime we should continue the general grant and the rate deficiency grant as a United Kingdom exercise, if I may put it that way. It is sometimes said that Wales gets an undue share. I do not say this by way of criticism, but I think that Wales has carried an undue share of the burdens of Government policy for many years. She has carried an undue share of the consequences of Government policy for many years. A small country of 2½ million people suffers a very severe blow when, in the course of one generation, she loses more than 250,000 of her young people. We know that this country, and indeed the whole of Europe, suffered grievously because of the 1914–18 war, and lost so much of the flower of their youth, but we in Wales suffered a double blow. We lost the flower of our youth because of that war, and we suffered a similar loss from 1921 to the beginning of the Second World War. We therefore feel this problem acutely, and we have carried an undue share of the burdens of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I went and saw the Head of the Valleys Road and was privileged to open a part of it. Who can count the contribution made by those valleys to the economic strength of this country in the years gone by? Who, too, can find words to express admiration, as I do, for the way in which all the old industries and the new ones have played their part in the economic life of this country? Our Welsh people have shown a remarkable degree of adaptability and have learned new skills and new techniques, and we can face the future without difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason I do not want to take any step without first having made a close study of its effect on Wales. I am very anxious that all the advantages which flow to Wales from association with the United Kingdom shall not be broken. I might add that I also take that view because of the advantages which flow to the United Kingdom from Wales. This is a two-way advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That completes what I have to say about the transfer of responsibilities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
an executive character, and, as I have indicated, they will be set out very fully in the transfer of functions Order, when we shall see the full picture in more detail than I am able to give this morning, and I promise that that will be done as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to my next function, what the Prime Minister described as the oversight of the administration and activities in Wales of other Government Departments. I am glad to find that something which was started by the Labour Government between 1945 and 1951 has taken root. This will be of enormous advantage to me and to my hon. Friends in carrying out these functions of overseeing Government action and Government administration in Wales. It will help us to find out how these actions, be they legislative or administrative, are affecting the people of Wales, and at the same time will enable us to learn from their experience the problems with which they have to cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we did between 1945 and 1951 was to begin the task of co-ordinating administration in Wales. We decided that there should be quarterly meetings of the heads of Departments in Wales. There are actually 16 of them. They are located in Cardiff with the exception of agriculture, which is situated in Aberystwyth. We brought them together so that they could exchange experiences and develop the habit of working together. They are collectively responsible for the whole field of Government administration and action in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has worked very well, and I pay tribute to the fine spirit of co-operation which exists amongst the officers workings in Wales. This is an advantage, because oversight depends on some imponderables. I know that I shall have the full co-operation of my colleagues who are in charge of Departments in Wales in carrying out these functions. I know that I shall have the united co-operation of all the heads of Departments. I know, too, that I shall have the co-operation of the local authorities. My desire is to ensure that we bring together all those working in Government administration in Wales to enable them to understand one another's problems, and to cooperate with one another. This will simplify administration, and I shall keep in touch with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
One or other of us will make frequent visits to Cardiff and other parts of Wales. We shall hold periodic meetings. The practice was to hold quarterly meetings, but they are now held once every four months. We shall discuss what arrangements can be made, because I can see great advantages in holding meetings between heads of Departments at which Ministers attend so that we can keep in close touch with one another. I know that there is a tendency to under-rate this function which has been transferred to me, but I think that it will give me and my colleagues an opportunity to keep in touch with what is being done in Wales. I believe that by contact between Ministers and the heads of Departments in Wales we shall be able to help them and they will be able to help us. I approach this task not as somebody merely watching, but in the spirit that at Ministerial level, and at the Welsh level, we can carry out common endeavour to do the best for Wales. I attach great importance to this proposal,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the next responsibility. The First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs made a statement in the House setting out the Government's proposals for, first, a national plan, and, secondly, regional plans. He indicated that the Secretary of State for Wales, in conjunction with him, would have responsibility for regional planning within Wales. I look forward very much to co-operating with my right hon. Friend. This is a big venture. This will be very important work. This will be the first real attempt to plan the economic and social development of our country. The fact that the Government and my right hon. Friend have emphasised that this is not only a national problem, but a regional one, indicates the spirit in which the Government are approaching this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we are all becoming convinced—as we from Wales have been for a long time—that this country must make the best use of its human resources to win its place in the modern world. We are faced with a difficult task in the economic field. This country led the world in the first Industrial Revolution, but she is grave danger of falling behind in the second one. We must plan the resources of the whole country, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
every part of the country must play a part in that. I think that we are all aware that we are in danger of allowing what happened in the first Industrial Revolution to happen again in our country, namely, to allow the population to be drawn away from certain areas by sheer economic forces, without any thought or planning. Think of what that did to Wales. Think of what the planless development of the first Industrial Revolution did to our country. Think of the physical scars which remain; and think even more of the human scars which were left behind. I therefore welcome very much the fact that the Government have said at the outset that in planning the economic development of this Kingdom due regard must and will be paid to the contribution which our country, as well as Scotland and Northern Ireland, can make to our economic progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a separate provision for Wales, as has been announced. There will be a regional economic planning board composed of officers with responsibilities in Wales for planning. One of my officers from the Welsh Office will be its chairman. I look forward to working with the Board. It will prepare plans for the development of Wales which will be given full consideration by Ministers. A start has been made upon development plans. We shall take that into account. The Board will draw up plans and submit them to the Minister. It will keep matters under review. It will keep us fully informed of the progress which is made and the problems which emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there will be an Economic council for Wales. It will not be an executive body, but it will advise on planning in the widest sense. It will assist in the formulation of plans for Wales, and have regard to the best use which can be made of Welsh resources, and it will advise on the steps necessary for implementing the plans. I am giving consideration to the setting up of the council. It is my desire that it shall be representative of Wales geographically as well as of all those in Wales who can bring their knowledge to bear on the problems. I want to bring in both sides of industry. I want local government to be closely associated with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
One thing which I have always wanted to do—I have not been able to do it yet—is to bring into this field the men and women in our universities, university colleges and technical colleges who have given a good deal of time and thought to the problems of Wales and who have a vital contribution to make. I look forward with confidence to having their co-operation. I want to associate them with the economic council for Wales. Like, I am sure, my colleagues, I have been deeply impressed by some of the most recent Welsh publications. I am reading one at the moment—"South Wales in the Sixties". I read the other day a series of essays edited by Professor Brinley Thomas. We know of the work of Professor Edward Nevin. Many young men and women have made a close study of the economic problems of Wales. Some of them have developed bold plans for its future. Some of the ideas are very new. I want these young men and women to be given the opportunity through the economic council to play their part. I want to bring the men and women with expert knowledge in the universities and technical colleges into the field to work. I do not want our colleges to become ivory towers. I want them to take a real part in our life. It will be my endeavour to ensure that that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales has a great contribution to make to the future of this country, just as it has done in the past. Most of my public life has been spent in years in which the tide has been running out for Wales. I want, if I can, to stop it running out, and to begin to turn it back. I am sure that through this instrument, and with the close co-operation of industry, local government, the universities, and all those who can contribute, we have a chance of formulating a plan for Wales which will make its future secure. It is to that end that I shall work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the right hon. Gentleman gave a date for the publication of the White Paper on local government reorganisation which cannot be fulfilled. Let me say that in fairness to those working on it. It is a bigger task than, perhaps, the right hon. Gentleman anticipated. I shall be glad to bring this body fully into play. Its members will be members of the planning board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the new town. Someone told me that I have been foolish to stick my neck out on this matter. For a quarter of a century we have talked about the great problem of mid-Wales. All the time the population of mid-Wales has been draining away. Here we have five of the loveliest counties in Wales. I am very fond of mid-Wales. I always say to tourists, with every respect to Snowdonia and even greater respect to Gower, what a lovely part it is. We all know what is happening. May I give two simple figures? The proportion of the population over 65 years of age in mid-Wales is 20 per cent. higher than it is in the rest of Wales. The proportion of people under 44 years of age is 5 per cent. less. We need no computer to find out what will happen in 25 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came to the conclusion after studying the matter that we should attempt to find a radical solution to this problem. I am still convinced of that. We have had endless reports. The right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East had a report on depopulation 18 months ago. He has not yet made any statement about it. I do not object to his playing party politics; I do it myself sometimes. We are not agreed about a new town. I have yet to find the Opposition very united in this Parliament. We have six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that what is required is a focal point of new growth which in time will permeate the whole region. I came to the conclusion that the best way to deal with the matter was to use the legislation available and to establish a new town in mid-Wales. The hon. and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) asked me a series of questions. I gave him a short reply. I do not know whether he complains about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to visit mid-Wales during the Recess. I have had consultations with the very energetic Secretary of the Industrial Association for mid-Wales. I pay tribute to the fact that these five local authorities have come together. I hope that their example will be emulated. We can do with more co-operation between local authorities in Wales. I am glad that this association of local authorities has been joined by Mr. Llefelys Davies, who at one time was Director of the Milk Marketing Board and who did so much for the farmers and agriculture. Now, in his retiring years, he has returned to. his native Cardiganshire, one of the areas affected by depopulation, as the Chairman of this Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to meet the people of mid-Wales. I shall be meeting the council. I thought that I should meet the council first. I do not want to impose a new town on it. I want it to join with me in establishing a new town. That is my desire. I want to carry the council with me. I do not know whether we shall succeed. I cannot promise success. All that I can promise is that we will try. Unless some Government—I hone that it will be this Government—make a bold attack on the problem of depopulation, these counties are on the way out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard it said that the best thing for the whole Kingdom might be if this lovely region were kept as a playground and holiday area. That may be the answer. But if the country wants to keep mid-Wales as a place to which it can go and enjoy the lovely scenery of the hills, Plynlimon, and the valleys, it has no right to ask for if at the expense of impoverishing the people living there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words about the administrative arrangements. We have established a small office in London with a staff of about 25—we hope to keep it small—large enough for the work which it has to do, with everyone doing a full day's work. I am glad that we have already established
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
a very good staff in London, and I am proud of them. We hope very shortly to welcome our colleagues, visiting for the first time. The main office will be in Cardiff. There are about 350 people in our office at Cardiff. We are giving consideration to whatever changes may be necessary, and we hope to make them them known in due time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to cover as much ground as I could, without unduly taking up the time of the Committee, in explaining my responsibilities and functions, and the spirit in which I approach them. I shall do my best so to work the Welsh Office, and to build an administration on such sound foundations, that I shall have the proud privilege of handing on a permanent legacy to my country and my people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should also like to congratulate and extend my best wishes to the Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister of State and Under-Secretary of State. Of course, we look forward to the day when, once again, we shall be occupying the benches on that side of the Committee, but, meanwhile, we wish them every possible success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it will be agreed that we have heard a fair and searching speech from my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) and, in response, in the statement of the Secretary of State, a full and frank statement on the problems which, we appreciate, are not easy to unfold in a single speech. There may not be such a great division between us on ultimate objectives, but naturally there are some differences of emphasis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that what has happened may be seen in some respects as a logical development of what has gone before. An important step was taken in the 1945–51 Parliament when there were instituted the meetings of the heads of Government Departments in Wales. However, I noticed that the right hon. Gentleman did not take credit for something else which was done by the Government of that time, namely, the setting up of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Council for Wales. The right hon. Gentleman was strangely silent on that today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the omission had any particular significance. Does it mean that there is no future for that body, or that it is to have a different function? I hope that I am not being unfair in mentioning the matter in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I did not refer to this. My hon. Friend the Minister of State will deal with it afterwards. Looking at the clock, I thought that I was taking up an undue length of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept what the right hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend was right in saying that the first significant political change was the setting up of a Minister for Welsh Affairs by a Conservative Government. I take the point made by the right hon. Gentleman that, superficially at least, the substitution of his office as Secretary of State for Wales is an advance. On the face of it, it is a more important and bigger office than a Minister for Welsh Affairs. I think, however, that that apparent position needs a little examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand—I am trying to express the general feeling as far as I can—when the party opposite appointed a Secretary of State for Wales, the first reaction in Wales was that this was a significant advance, but when the details became known—and I am trying to be fair—there was a feeling of disappointment. I do not want to overstate the position, but that was the case. I would not go as far as a Welsh Nationalist friend of mine, a member of "Plaid Cymru", who said that the party opposite had promised a mountain but brought forth a molehill; I do not think it is as bad as that. Certainly, disappointment was felt by many people in the Principality; and it was not confined to any one party. It was felt the change was more apparent than real and that the advance to the status of a Secretary of State was a bigger advance in name than it might prove to be in substance. That may be some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
thing which the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will have to disprove by what they achieve. We in Wales will only be able to judge the efficacy of these changes by what happens in the months ahead and not by the mere change in nomenclature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should, therefore, for a few moments—and I necessarily abbreviate what I had to say—examine what the right hon. Gentleman has told us about the functions which have been taken over. First, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, the new Department will take over responsibility for housing, town and country planning, the organisation of local government and new towns. I take the point that the organisation of local government is a function of particular importance in Wales. Town and country planning, as well as economic planning, is of great importance in Wales. I readily see that there is a strong case for including these among the first functions to come under the province of the new office of the Secretary of State. As to new towns, the right hon. Gentleman has made a special point, on which, no doubt, other hon. Members will comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not, however, sure that in relation to the need for transfer of functions, housing is a matter of the utmost priority in Wales, as opposed to housing in England. For example, a house built in Swansea is not really different from a house in Middlesbrough. But, surely, education in many parts of Wales is very different from education in England. I should have thought that there was a far stronger case for bringing education under the aegis of the new Department in the first place than for bringing housing under the aegis of that Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member not aware that there is an extremely serious housing problem in Wales? Has he forgotten it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I do not see how that housing problem will be solved more quickly by the mere transfer of function in this case. I do not see how a Welsh Secretary of State will produce houses more quickly in Swansea than a Minister of Housing for the whole of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do see that in some parts the Welsh language is fighting a desperate last-ditch battle for survival. I regard it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
as a serious and grave criticism of the new changes that education has not been transferred immediately to the new office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tudor Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am expressing my views. Of course, I am speaking largely for myself. I do not know whether my right hon. or hon. Friends will agree with me, but it is not improper to express one's thoughts. It will be a bad day if we become mere ciphers in expressing only what one's party thinks in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought also that the case for an early transfer of health functions was far greater than in the case of housing. Wales has peculiar industrial problems in which the demands upon our health and hospital services are, in many cases, to be distinguished from those in many parts of the rest of the United Kingdom. The history of the devolution of the administration of the Welsh Board of Health would possibly have made it easier to transfer that function than in the case of some of the functions of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. I was surprised that some parts of the Ministry of Health functions had not been transferred rather than housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if there was an obvious candidate for inclusion, agriculture is something which already, under my right hon. Friend and his predecessors in successive Governments, has enjoyed a good deal of natural devolution, which has evolved naturally from the different nature of our farming industry in many parts of the Principality than in the United Kingdom as a whole. It is surprising, to say the least, that the Welsh small farmer, the hill farmer, and the kind of farming which we have in many parts of Wales, are not to be distinguished by inclusion in the administrative setup which we are now offered but are to remain under the direction of a Minister of Agriculture for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise briefly what I have said, I accept the importance of planning. I accept also the inclusion of local government in the new functions. I am surprised that housing has been given priority over agriculture and some aspects of health administration. I am astonished that education has been omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am leaving out a good deal what I intended to say, but I want to say some-
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
thing about the latter remarks of the Secretary of State. I think and hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will not oppose the proposals which he has developed about the regional economic planning board for Wales and the economic council for Wales. Indeed, my right hon. Friend, during his term of office, laid some of the foundations in that direction. We are not opposed to planning on a broad canvas—we believe in planning in that sense—but there was in the right hon. Gentleman's tone of voice a conviction that the future can be solved by planning. That is implicit in much of the doctrine of the party opposite. The right hon. Gentleman then referred to the achievements of the country in the past and he felt that they might not be equalled in the future. I remind him that some of the great achievements by countries like Japan today have not necessarily been achieved solely by planning. Indeed, in some countries like that, planners would surely not have given priority to an industry like the export of transistor radios, which would have been short of raw materials had planners had their way in the early days of that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As long as we do not think that this is the Sesame or the easy solution to all our difficulties, it can play a valuable part. As long as we do not believe that a collection of committees, councils and advisory bodies can provide a solution to all the difficult problems that lie ahead, they can do a great service. As long as we do not believe that the mere changing of name and the setting up of a new office will solve all our difficulties, we see the office of the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues as a useful step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, reservations as to the extent of the stride forward which has been taken. We hope that the right hon. Gentleman will reconsider the nature of the functions which have been transferred. We hope that he will re-examine them and see whether there might not be a case for the inclusion of education, to which I have referred, that this is not merely a change of name but a real change, that he will take account of what my right hon. Friend has said that, representing only the Welsh Department and not continuing to have responsibility for another Department as his predecessors did he will continue to put up the same vigorous fight for Wales within the Cabinet. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
sure that the right hon. Gentleman will try to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that be the right hon. Gentleman's will and objective he will have a lot of support from this side and a lot of cooperation from all the Committee. We wish him well in that respect. We hope that this will be the beginning of greater achievement for Wales, but we need to see what the performance will be. To that extent, we can be pardoned if in some degree we reserve our judgment today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, perhaps, be pardoned, Lady Megan, for informing you of a small fact of which you will not be aware. Twenty-four years ago, your father sat in the same Chair as you are occupying today when we were discussing the evacuation of the House of Commons and the setting up of regional government in Wales to protect democratic government in this country in case of invasion. I congratulate you, Lady Megan, on occupying the Chair this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) on taking up his very distinguished post. No man in the public life of Wales more richly deserves the honour than he himself. This is the crowning achievement of a lifetime of service which has been devoted to improving the lot of the people who live in the Principality. I should also like to congratulate my other two hon. Friends on occupying the posts of Minister of State and Under-Secretary of State to which they have been appointed. I am sure that they will bring to the problems of the troubled Principality all that sympathy, and, what is more, all that knowledge, which will enable substantial progress to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate really arises out of the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 19th November. This was what he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can say that after spending a great deal of time on this, to get the right degree of devolution in Wales without breaking up existing Departments where that would have been inimical to the interests of Wales, I think that we have got about the right answer here, but we shall be prepared to change it in any direction if we find that changes are needed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th November, 1964; Vol. 702, c. 626.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
In that sense, what has been done in the setting up of the new office can be regarded as a development from previous changes and one that is not fixed or permanent but which, as my right hon. Friend said, can be adapted as experience dictates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When that statement was made in the House, it was interesting to see the reaction. First, the former Minister for Welsh Affairs, in a tone of hostility, seemed to think that the situation was not any different from what had existed before. In other words, because it was exactly the same as the previous position, it was to be condemned. It would appear, therefore, that he was condemning his own former rôle as a Minister. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) took an entirely different view. He thought that it would mean far-reaching constitutional changes. So we had two Members on the Opposition Front Bench taking diametrically opposed views about the change. We have had to wait until today for the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) to give outright support for the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Modified support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now the hon. Gentleman wants to modify his support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would certainly like to know what hon. Members opposite do feel about this. Are they in favour of it or not? We want an unequivocal answer. The former Minister says that nothing has changed. The hon. Member for Hereford says that there have been great constitutional changes, but even he has not yet said whether what he regards as great constitutional changes are welcome and entitled to the support of the party opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were two other reactions. My hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) regarded this as a great concession to nationalism. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Iorwerth Thomas) regarded this as a step in the devolution of democratic government. Apparently it means different things to different people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard it not as a concession to nationalism but as an attempt to establish better government. It will attempt to bring all the Civil Service apparatus more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
under the control of the elected representatives of the area in which they function, and it is in that sense that I welcome this experiment, to see how far we can bring power closer to the people. With the growth of central Government activities, with the concentration of power in Whitehall, decisions taken here are often the passing by a Minister of a minute from a civil servant, with no attempt made to get that degree of accountability for what is being done that we should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a rather irresponsible way, I have suggested that unless we change things it is inevitable that the Civil Service will sit above the salt while the elected representatives will sit below. That, however, has been the tendency in the past, for power has not been in our hands but in the hands of distant civil servants, "faceless men" exercising decisions. Parliament as now constituted is incapable of exercising adequate supervision of its own apparatus. I therefore welcome the change now being made as an attempt to improve democratic Government and to give to the elected representatives of the people the proper oversight of the apparatus created by the Executive. That is the approach I have always had to this problem. It was the approach I put before the Select Committee which resulted in the establishment of the Welsh Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, instead of a Minister giving, perhaps, one-twentieth of his time to Welsh Affairs, we have a Secretary of State giving all his time to them and in a position to consider them organically. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend has executive functions. I think this was a mistake. What we want is a Minister who will be above all the Departments, who will pull them in together and co-ordinate them, who will look at the job as an organic whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman, in that case, wants a Tory Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last Tory Minister was able to give only about one-eighteenth part of his time to the job. Indeed, today he spoke not as a former Minister of Welsh Affairs but as a former Minister of Housing and Local Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is absent at the moment, but I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that he devoted a good deal of energy and experience to the problems of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course he did. Unlike most of his predecessors, the right hon. Gentleman has energy. He is a restless man. No sense of modesty would restrain him. If he had been devoting the whole of his time to Wales he would have tramped around like a Roman governor knocking heads together and initiating new developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) suggested that it did not really matter whether my right hon. Friend was in the Cabinet or not. I was astonished that an experienced ex-Minister should say that it does not matter whether a Minister is in the Cabinet or not. What folly can come out of political prejudice—[HON. MEMBERS: "He did not say that."] The right hon. Gentleman criticised what, he said, was the fact, that my right hon. Friend was in the Cabinet without power, and therefore should not be there. The sense of what he said was that it did not matter whether a Minister was inside or outside the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever powers a Minister may have departmentally, the fact that he is in the Cabinet gives him extra status and a right to express his view within the Cabinet. To be a member of the Cabinet is in itself a powerful thing. I was, as a Minister, outside the Cabinet and I know what it really means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems in the Welsh Grand Committee is that, if we are to get Votes and Supply, the Grand Committee process will be quite inadequate to deal effectively with the situation. These short, 10-minute pecks at problems are utterly inadequate to deal with the important tasks we must perform and the important matters we must discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend described two functions. He described the planning board which, I understand, is to consist of the 16 regional controllers. Who will preside over it? Unless someone presides over it, who has greater authority than any of these individuals, we shall be back to the old quarterly conference which really effected nothing. The quarterly conference without a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
chairman greatly superior to any individual member will not be adequate to deal with the problem. I want to know whether this board is to have a Ministerial head. Do not let us be fobbed off with a system whereby they toss a coin and decide who is to be in the chair. One gets no co-ordination from an assortment of that kind. We want not a collection of individual voices but an attempt to look at these problems as a whole. For example, I remember discussing an important matter of physical rehabilitation. It involved a road. It had been considered in various Departments, but the regional controller of the Ministry of Transport had never been in the discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the problems of Wales, do let us look at them in an organic, co-ordinated manner. The same goes for housing. What is the use of providing housing in a certain place and then shutting down the railways and building factories miles away? So far there has been no attempt to look at these things in a co-ordinated way. Unless the planning board has a Minister to draw together the various activities and to treat the problems organically we shall not get the effective developments we should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we are to have, according to my right hon. Friend, an economic council. I was a little shocked about this. If it is to be purely an economic council will it have regard for social rehabilitation? It is no use attempting to build factories in derelict areas unless we physically rehabilitate such areas. Therefore, to call this an economic council seems to militate against its effectiveness in taking a co-ordinated look at everything associated with the problems of economic development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was purely in order to save time that I did not expand on this more fully. I referred to the statement of my right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs about the functions of the new Boards. My right hon. Friend used these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…first, provide for a full and balanced development of the country's economic and social resources; and, secondly, to ensure that
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
the regional implications of growth are clearly understood and taken into account in the planning of land use, of development—in particular of industrial development—and of services."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 10ih December, 1964; Vol. 703. c. 1829.]</p></blockquote>
I did not quote that, but I did refer to the statement. That will be precisely the task for the council in Wales as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard my right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State make that statement and I was rather surprised that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales referred to it in a more narrow context. I am pleased to hear that the council's work in Wales will be as widely spread as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the council will do away with this proliferation of professional committees in the Principality. There is no part of the U.K. with more committees. I hope that the council will pull them all together so that the council itself can take a co-ordinated and balanced view of the development needs of the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is to be the position of the planning board and the new council in relation to each other? Are the plans of the planning board to go up to the council or will the council pass ideas down to the planning board? Will the execution of plans have to have Cabinet approval, or will they be matters within the purview of the Secretary of State? Will he bring them before us? We are the elected representatives of the people. What we want is more accountability for what is being done in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in the position of the Office will be subject to three conditions: first, whether it will produce better government in Wales; secondly, whether we get better co-ordination; thirdly, whether we get better accountability to the elected representatives of the people for what is being done, allegedly on their behalf. I add a fourth. It depends very largely on the degree of initiative taken by the Welsh Office, instead of its being an office which merely gives permission to someone else to do things. I want to see the Welsh Office being really dynamic and putting forward ideas whereby we can take Wales into the twenty-first century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an appropriate moment for me to say that there are still several hon. Members who wish to speak in the debate. I therefore
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
appeal to hon. Members to impose upon themselves a self-denying ordinance so that more hon. Members can speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first add my congratulations to those already tendered to you, Lady Megan, on your elevation to your present office? You were well brought up politically, but even so I think that you will find it difficult to prevent yourself from wanting to take part in a debate on Welsh affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first task which I should like to perform—it is not a task but a pleasure—is to express on behalf of my constituents of Montgomery generally and the people of Newtown in particular their appreciation of the urgent visit by the Secretary of State last Monday. His visit has shown that he cares, which matters a great deal to warm-hearted people such as those who live in Montgomery. His words there and later excite the hope that there will be immediate Government action to help the alleviation of the distress and to meet the cost of the destruction. I am having talks with the right hon. Gentleman about that later today. On Monday, he saw the damage done only 48 hours earlier in Newtown itself. He visited many homes, as I had done earlier, and saw the great destruction. Even so, there had been a great deal of clearing up, as he will appreciate. I am sure that he feels as I do, that there ought to be an urgent inquiry into the cause of this flooding. This is the second very serious flood within four years, and nearly as important is the knowledge that there have been 30 flood warnings in the intervening period. This matter needs investigation, at a high level and very quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to be as brief as I can, but as I am the sole speaker on behalf of my party it may be that I shall be a little longer than I would otherwise intend. I congratulate the Secretary of State, the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary on their appointments. I am sure that personally they will do their utmost to make a success of their offices and to ensure that Wales benefits from this new departure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am amazed that the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) should cavil at the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
ment's decision to appoint a Secretary of State for Wales. I am sure that I am speaking on behalf of the representatives of all parties in Wales when I say that in Wales we regard this an important step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is distorting what I said. I was careful to separate the effectiveness of the office from the nature of the office. I welcomed the right hon. Gentleman in his appointment and in his title, but questioned whether he would have even as much power as his predecessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I misunderstood. The right hon. Gentleman was limiting his congratulations to the title and the bearer of the office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is an important step forward and it could become very important. Clearly, much depends on what is made of it. I do not regard it as an end in itself. It has always been my view, a view shared by some, but not all, hon. Members, that what Wales really needs is legislative devolution. This new appointment is a step on the way, and it must be judged by this test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales needs an integrated general policy to meet its needs as an identity. In Wales there is a crying need for co-ordinated Government action, not only to conserve but to strengthen a Welsh identity. I am not an economic nationalist, but I am a great believer in the value to a nation of a heritage and individuality such as we have inherited in Wales. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will do all that they can to ensure that the Welsh Office takes steps to see that we have an integrated Government policy in Wales, bearing in mind not only the needs of the United Kingdom as a whole, but the needs of Wales in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the previous Government there was no general policy for Wales which met the particular needs of Wales. Not only was there an absence of such a policy, but there was an almost complete absence of the means of executing such a policy even if it had existed. We have heard a good deal lately about the complaint of the First Secretary that the economic life of the country is controlled by the gnomes of Zurich. In Wales the complaint has been of the control of the destinies of Wales by the gnomes of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Whitehall. What we hope is that this development brings real power nearer to Wales. A Welsh Secretariat is to be welcomed as a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mean no disrespect to the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues when I say that in retrospect it may appear that the most important development for the benefit of Wales which has come out of this step is the elevation in the status and the expansion of the Civil Service for Wales. I wish the new head of the Welsh Office, the Civil Service in Wales—because that is what it has become—all success in his office, because his is the key position. It is on the calibre and power of the head of the Welsh Civil Service that much will depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great advantages of this new development is that there will now be a representative of Wales in the Cabinet who has Wales not as a second priority, and who is not mainly concerned with another Ministry, but having also a supervisory function for Wales, but whose sole function will be to look after the needs of Wales. If there is any value in preserving Welsh identity, that is the least we deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there are certain grave deficiencies in the powers already given to the Secretary of State. It is very important that the Secretary of State should have not only specific responsibility for Wales, but the executive power to do things for Wales. We have heard that he is virtually taking over powers previously exercised by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, but when we consider the other matters for which he should be responsible, we can see that his office is in a complete embryo state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take education. What powers will the Secretary of State have over education in Wales? The Secretary of State for Scotland has complete responsibility for education in Scotland. From time to time, we have heard comparisons of the Scottish and the English and Welsh systems, to the advantage of the former. I firmly believe that the education system in Wales should come completely under the Secretary of State. This should be a first priority. I urge the right hon. Gentleman to grasp as much power as he can for Wales. One of the first needs of Wales is to control
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
its own education system. I was recently happy to learn that my constituency sends more students to universities in proportion to its population than any other county in the British Isles. This picture is generally indicative of the whole of Wales. I am sure that if executive responsibility for education passed to the Welsh Office, Wales would leave the rest of the country even further behind in education matters. We have the great problem of preserving and fostering the Welsh language and its use. We have particular education problems in Wales. I know that the right hon. Gentleman takes great interest in the fortunes of the Welsh School in London, for example, and in similar movements. There is a Welsh school in Llanelly. It is obvious, not only for these cultural reasons, but also if Wales is to be developed economically and socially in an integrated way, that the Secretary of State should have full responsibility for the education system in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another subject very much in our minds is that of water. I referred earlier to the possibility of an investigation into the cause of flooding in Wales. What responsibility has the Secretary of State for water in Wales and for its development as an important resource? We know the causes of friction in Wales when local authorities from outside or inside come prospecting in our valleys in search of water. We also know that as a result of this flooding there may be a concerted demand for more regulating reservoirs in Wales. I am certain that when they were in Opposition the Government were right to insist that there should be a Welsh water board to develop Welsh water resources. Is the Secretary of State to have responsibility for the development of Welsh water resources?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a great deal of exaggeration in some quarters about the potential sale of water as a valuable natural resource. For example, I can never understand the argument that Wales could charge English authorities for water which flows naturally down a river, because there is a regulating reservoir, such as Clywedog, higher up the river. If that argument were sound which it is not, then if they had a regulating reservoir, the people of Austria could charge the people of Hungary for water drawn from the Danube and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
people of the Sudan could similarly charge the people of Egypt for water drawn from the Nile. Nevertheless, apart from this exaggeration, it is clear that water is an important natural resource which should be developed nationally and that there is a need for a national board in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Secretary of State, having taken over responsibility for Welsh roads, particularly trunk roads, from the Minister of Transport, the right hon. Gentleman did not insist in taking over responsibility for the railways in Wales as well. This is a very important matter, especially now. I was surprised to read recently—I do not know whether this is right or wrong—that the President of Plaid Cymru, who is a highly respected man in Wales, quoted certain statistics in an article which he claimed showed that the railways in Wales had been making a profit overall. I do not know whether this claim is correct. No separate figures are issued by British Railways but if it is true—and surely the Secretary of State has the means to find out—there is a very strong case for the Secretary of State taking over full responsibility for the railways, for why should railways in remote rural areas in Wales, which are very important to those areas, be closed if overall the railways in Wales are paying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if there is a loss? What then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter could surely be investigated. The railways are important to Wales and should be the responsibility of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will have a Welsh information office on the lines of the Scottish information office, which has been very valuable in Scotland, because of the importance of maintaining good public relations. I was surprise that the Secretary of State did not say anything about the future of the Council for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although it has a grandios name, except as an advisory body this Council has had very little to do. It has contributed much knowledge by its reports, but I should like to hear that there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
some intention to use it as a basis for further development. There lies in this body the seed of possible further and much greater development. It ought to be transformed into an elected body. Although the Secretary of State is responsible for Wales, no one can say at the moment that he is responsible to Wales. He is responsible to the British Parliament. I am sure that the Minister of State would privately share my view that there should be an elected Welsh body to whom responsibility for certain matters could be delegated. Could not the Council for Wales be used in this way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear from the Minister of State whether he intends to adopt the suggestion, which he made himself when in Opposition, that this Grand Committee should meet from time to time in Cardiff and thereby bring the elected representatives of Wales nearer to the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by referring to a matter which the Secretary of State dealt with last, namely, the proposed new town in Wales. I agree with him that radical action is needed to meet the problem of depopulation in mid-Wales. On that there is no disagreement. I agree with him that massive capital investment is needed in mid-Wales. On that, too, there is no difference between us. That is what distinguishes us from the previous Government. At least by saying that it was intended to build a new town the Secretary of State showed that he acknowledged that massive capital investment is needed in this area to further radical development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was surprised at was that when I asked detailed Questions to elicit such information as the likely cost, the criteria to be considered in selecting the site, and so on, he was able to give only a short reply. It showed that every little thought and consideration had been given to this matter. I hope that when the right hon. Gentleman meets the Mid-Wales Development Association he will not do so with a closed mind. A new town will clearly cost tens of millions of £s. If that sum of money were used by a development corporation for mid-Wales, and we had not one single town, with growth at one point, but many points of growth by developing the existing towns,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
this might be far more beneficial to mid-Wales as a whole, and far more acceptable socially and culturally. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that in Northern Ireland there is a so-called "plantation" which developed historically many years ago. It may have been a good thing economically for that part of Ireland, but no one can say that politically, socially, or culturally, it was a good thing. It has left in its train many problems. If we were to have a new town of 50,000 people in mid-Wales, with no building up of mid-Wales beforehand to meet this, we would be swamped. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to ponder over this question, because mid-Wales ought not to be faced with a simple choice of a new town or nothing; virtually a new town or simply following the policy of the previous government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We clearly need massive capital investment and I again ask the Secretary of State not to have a closed mind on the problem or remedy when he meets the people of mid-Wales. He may find that it would be far more acceptable to have the development corporation armed with this money which would otherwise go to providing the new town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Idwal Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lady Megan, I, too, congratulate you on being Chairman on this very important occasion in this Grand Committee, because the debate this morning shows clearly that we have reached a very important milestone in the history of our country. I use the word "milestone" advisedly, because it is a stage in the journey. It is not the end of road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the set-up sums up our national heritage, and there are two factors in this heritage which I think should be borne in mind this morning. First, Wales never involved into a kingdom. We never had a line of kings, and consequently we are different in that respect from Scotland. We never even had a principality of a native kind. We had one Prince of Wales. He was the last, and even he did not govern the whole of Wales. What we did with the Roval dynasty was to export it to England. We exported the illustrious line of the Tudors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She kept it, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Idwal Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We exported our aristocracy at the same time. I think that we were very rich in our exports, and I believe that we have benefited by losing those people from our midst. Consequently, since 1542, the Constitution of Wales has been merged with the Constitution of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factor, however, is of considerable importance. Although Wales never evolved into a kingdom, it did evolve into a nation, a nation living her own life, possessing her own native language, and expressing her nationhood in her educational, cultural, and religious institutions. During the nineteenth century nationalism in Wales never crystallised into a separatist movement, as was the case on the Continent. She concentrated on educational advance and religious reform, hence the founding of the University Colleges in Wales, the Intermediate Education Act, 1899, the setting up of a Welsh Department of the Board of Education in 1907, and the disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1919.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of Welsh nationhood has to be accepted, and every advance in our social services and in the vicissitudes of our economic life is reflected in our national life. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the experience of the inter-war period, when large areas in Wales became derelict, and we lost such a large percentage of our people, has had an impact on the Welsh nation, and I believe that that impact is showing its effect here this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Second World War we saw an appreciation of this fact. The Council of Wales was set up as an advisory body. In 1951 we had a Minister for Welsh Affairs. In 1957 we had a Minister of State for Wales. But this morning we are debating a Measure which is a breakthrough because it is a departure from the previous set-up. The Minister for Welsh Affairs was primarily a Minister of another Department, and it was by virtue of that other Department that he sat in the Cabinet. The "Welsh Affairs" was merely an appendix. When we came to the question of Tryweryn, the Minister for Welsh Affairs acted as Minister for Local Government rather than as Minister for Welsh Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, for the first time, we have an entirely separate Department for Wales,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
a Department which is not merely an adjunct to other Departments of State. This means that the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for no Departments other than those appertaining to Wales, and he is given the highest possible status in the Cabinet. He is a member of the Cabinet by virtue of his Welsh function and not, as hitherto, by virtue of being a Minister of another Government Department. At last Wales has a seat in the Cabinet by her own right and not as an adjunct to another Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, in as much as the Secretary of State has a seat in the Cabinet Wales also has a voice in the general Cabinet policy as it applies to the whole of Britain, and it is this dual rôle which constitutes the breakthrough. It is this dual role which makes this step interesting, for it is an example of a pragmatic approach to the implementation of a principle, the principle of Welsh nationhood on the one hand, and the principle of an integrated Britain on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the present stage there are three main functions of the new Ministry, There are the functions which have been transferred from other Ministries. These are housing and local government, roads and trunk roads, for which the Secretary of State becomes responsible. Then there are administrative departments which have not yet been transferred. Then there is the question of regional planning, for which the Secretary of State will be-responsible in consultation with the first Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is running out. I should have liked to have dealt with "Signposts to the New Wales" which says that the Secretary of State will take over education, health and agriculture, as well as housing and local government. It is true that that statement was made, but it is equally true that such transfers will take time. The present set up is not the last word. As the Prime Minister declared on 19th November:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…we shall be prepared to change in any direction … if we find that changes are needed".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th November, 1964, Vol. 702, c. 626.]</p></blockquote>
What we require is the machinery for change and the experience of transfer. At the present time we have the experience of transfer from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
this is not the end. We have accepted the principle of occupying a house of many manions. At the first stage we are occupying one room and one corridor only, but there is no doubt that in the course of time other rooms in the house will also be occupied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the observations of the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) with regard to education. I, too, would like to see the Educational Department taken over by the Secretary of State for Wales, because here is a rich field of educational experiment. However, I shall not dwell too much on that because time is running out. I do not think that I am far wrong when I say that Wales looks forward to the time, which I trust is not too far ahead, when the Secretary of State will have executive authority in the Department of Education and Science. After all, the history of education in Wales is different from that in England, and that history counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other factors, too, and I come now to regional planning. I have already referred to the fact that Wales is a national entity. Economically, Wales forms an integral part of Britain. Economic separation from the rest of Britain is not necessary for national self-realisation. Indeed, separation would be inimical to the welfare of the Welsh nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee have always believed in planning, and that we in Wales should have a place in our planning. We have a contribution to make to the economic planning of the future, a contribution in heavy basic industries—iron and steel, fuel and power—as well as in contributing something in rural industries. What I consider of tremendous importance in this age of technology is that Wales has a considerable potential in research both at university and industrial level. In this respect I have Bangor particularly in mind, but all this needs to be planned so that our area in Wales will have a contribution to make to the general planning in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have reached an important stage in the constitutional and economic life of Wales. For the first time in history, Wales is to be planned. It is all very well to say as the hon. Member for Barry said, that nothing can be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
achieved from plans. Wales has never been planned, and we need to plan it. It is a good thing that we are going to plan in agricultural districts, in heavy industrial districts, and also in cultural districts. By doing that we shall save the Welsh nation economically and culturally, and also do something for the welfare of Britain in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need hardly say that the opportunity to speak in the Welsh Grand Committee is for me not only a privilege but an honour. Since you, Lady Megan, are in the Chair, I feel certain that I shall be in good hands. I well remember at the age of 17 being taken to listen to your revered father. I only wish that I had his ability for oratory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of questions have been asked this morning about the constitutional changes which the Government have made. I regret that there has not been sufficient time to hear the views and opinions of many more hon. Members. Although we know more than we knew before, we look forward to hearing what the Minister of State will have to say at the end of the debate. Let me take this opportunity of saying how glad I am that the right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) has been appointed the first Secretary of State for Wales. I congratulate him on his appointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In assessing the significance of these changes, we must look not only at the short-term but at the long-term. It is clear from speeches today that opinion about what the long-term should be differs very much. Without going back into history, either to the Act of Union or to what was done by Edward I and Edward III, if I may mention those names in this Committee I can say that there has been more constitutional change since 1950 than ever before. I think that we are all agreed that our appraisal and criticism of the constitutional changes must be based, as the right hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Ness Edwards) said, on the question; will the people of Wales get the best possible service of Government? It is on the answer to that question that the changes will be judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
In 1951, the Conservative Administration appointed a Minister for Welsh Affairs with a seat in the Government. That was followed in 1957 by the appointment of a Minister of State. He was a member of another place, which was a great benefit to the person carrying out that job. Lord Brecon was a most effective Minister, and, without comparing his qualities with those of his successor, I would say to the Minister of State that I think that he will be somewhat restricted, certainly during the period of a Government with a narrow majority, by not being able to be as much in the Principality from Monday to Friday as the person in that position would like. Those are the days when the machinery of government—the Civil Service—is at work. However, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I wish him well in his job. Those good wishes are also extended to the hon. Member for Bed-wellty (Mr. Finch), whose knowledge of many Welsh subjects is so well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point is that which was put so well by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) and which was taken up incorrectly by the right hon. Member for Caerphilly. The point which my right hon. Friend made, and which I make again, is that the doubt in our minds is whether the Minister for Welsh Affairs, with a seat in the Cabinet and with the full weight of a Department of England and Wales behind him, was in a much stronger position than the Secretary of State for Wales. Surely a Minister with a Department behind him must be in a stronger position. How right my right hon. Friend was in saying that this was a question of power and influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the long-term future of the Secretary of State, I ask the Government whether they look on these steps as final. From what has been said today it seems to me that they are very far from final. In the words of the Prime Minister, it seems that there will be changes in future to increase the executive responsibility of the Secretary of State. This is why a number of us have tabled Questions to the Secretary of State. We fully understand that his answers, to use a cricketing term, have to be rather on the "playing back" basis. He has not been Secretary of State for very long, but we sincerely wish to have answers to questions on such things as the Council for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
Wales and the functions of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important question concerns the powers of the Minister of Land and Natural Resources who has executive responsibility, not only for water, but for the Forestry Commission. Anyone who knows Wales, and particularly mid-Wales, where I live, realises that these are matters of burning interest. We want to know whether in the long term it will be the Secretary of State who will see this Minister off if he makes decisions which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State and his colleagues, are against the true interests of the Welsh people. Who will have the executive power?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I would say that we have seen a great improvement in the relationship between the Forestry Commission and the Minister of Agriculture in Wales. I urge the Secretary of State, with his oversight of these two departments within the Principality, to ensure that this improvement continues and that this new Ministry of Land and Natural Resources is kept within reasonable bounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a party point. In "Signposts to the New Wales" the Labour Party stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is envisaged that, in addition to his overall supervision of Welsh affairs, the Secretary of State will have executive responsibility over a wide field, including education, health, housing and local government, and agriculture."</p></blockquote>
Many people in Wales will be disappointed that this has not happened. Hon. Members opposite may say that this is not a broken pledge but that it will be done some time. However, they put it in their manifesto. We are on a difficult and slippery slope. How far do the Government intend to go with this process of devolution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great difference of opinion on this matter, even in this Committee. Some would like to go a very long way and eventually to see the duties of the Secretary of State based on the Scottish pattern. Others would like to see the economic functions kept tightly with England but more independence in respect of the Governmental functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Secretary of State; is it first touch, or home base? Is it a try, or does he intend to convert it? We want to know how far along the road of devolution the Government propose to go. I do not expect that the word "envisaged" should
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
be in the Labour Party's election manifesto next time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of our questions have been answered by the Secretary of State today. We hope that others will be answered by the Minister of State. In the months which lie ahead we shall scrutinise very carefully what the Secretary of State and his colleagues do, and we shall base our scrutiny entirely on whether the Welsh people will be best served by the steps which the Government propose to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Wales (Mr. Goronwy Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by saying how pleased I am, Lady Megan, that a name so illustrious in the history of Wales and the annals of the House of Commons leads the list of Members of the Welsh Grand Committee? It is understood in the country circles in which you and I move that a certain experience in the art of poaching is no drawback in applying for the post of gamekeeper, I think that we may expect in this Committee to find both skills deployed by our Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful and constructive debate. The tone of it was set by the two opening speeches, and, in particular, by the inspiring speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He indicated that I would, in replying to the debate, cover certain points with which he did not have sufficient time to deal. However, first, perhaps I will be permitted to refer to one or two points raised by the official spokesmen of the Tory Party in Wales. By the way, it is surprising that the official voice of Welsh Toryism comes from Leeds and Hereford and not from Barry and Denbigh. There may be an established reason for this kind of thing; I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) made great play with the fact that the Welsh Ministry was attached to a major Department and meant that this joint Minister, of which he was an example, would "carry weight" among other Departments and in the Cabinet. It is an ingenuous point, but I say frankly to him on this question of "carrying weight" with other Departments that surely an official arrangement whereby other Departments are expected to inform and consult the Welsh Office on all matters relating to Wales is a far more durable and dependable arrangement than simply to depend on the accident of personality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Whoever holds the office of Secretary of State for Wales, there is now a real consultative and co-ordinating function for the Welsh Office. That is much superior to the previous arrangement whereby sometimes there was consultation and sometimes co-ordination. Certainly there was personal weight—we grant that—but now there is the certainty of there being a centralised focus in which Wales deploys its claims and which other Departments consult and inform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make heavy weather of this, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that there was not consultation, by special instruction of the Prime Minister, with the Welsh Office by all other Departments on all Welsh matters under the previous Administration. There was such an instruction from the Prime Minister. Consultation was the order of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt. But the present arrangement is one under which there is this official definite consultation and information with an independent Minister in charge of his own office and who has additionally the status and position of Secretary of State. There is a great difference between the two positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point, before passing on to more informative points, is what the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) said in reference to the difference between my position and that of my immediate predecessor. The people best qualified to judge have already accorded their verdict on this on 15th October, namely, the Welsh electorate. Then, Wales gave a more emphatic rejection of Tory pretensions than did any other part of the United Kingdom. The fact is that, at best, the previous arrangement was a help here and there, but generally it was something of a charade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have every respect for the right hon. Gentleman, but the Opposition must not make too much of what happened under that arrangement when they were in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is disgraceful. Will not the hon. Gentleman agree that the condition of the Welsh economy since the appointment of the Minister of State has been absolutely transformed and that
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the position was immeasurably better than it ever was when the party opposite took office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dispute that. The improvement in the Welsh economy during the period when that arrangement was in effect was not due to that arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not alone, and not to any great extent. I urge hon. Members opposite not to lay too great stress on that arrangement whereby there was a peripatetic Minister in Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Full time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—full time—making a virtue of necessity simply because he did not have a seat in the House of Commons That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to the argument which I used and not exactly what the hon. Gentleman is trying to argue. My argument was that, particularly at a time when the Government have a narrow majority, it would certainly make the job of the Minister of State much easier if he were able to be in the other place. I have no wish to lose the hon. Gentleman from the House of Commons, from many points of view, but that was my argument. The hon. Gentleman is going a little far when he uses the words "pretensions" and "charade ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tory pretensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. The noble Lord did a very good job in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must agree to disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass on to the informative points which I am anxious to put to the Committee. My right hon. Friend has described how there will be separate Welsh Estimates and Votes, on which debates on Supply, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Ness Edwards) rightly said, must take place on the Floor of the House. There is nothing procedural or constitutional to prevent them from being taken in Grand Committee, but I think we would agree that the Floor of the House would be the place for such debates on Supply, with the Grand Committee engaged in close scrutiny of specific problems and topics arising from time to time from the administration of Government in Wales.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
We may, therefore, reasonably expect more time on the Floor of the House to debate Welsh questions. That is a matter for negotiation in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Welsh Grand Committee, it may be necessary to move for an increase in the number of Sittings. My right hon. Friend would be very glad to have the views of the Grand Committee and its Members on this possibility. At present, we have four Sittings. It may be that Members may feel that we should extend that number to five or six in one Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to Parliamentary Questions, which certain hon. Members, had they been called, would have raised in this debate, perhaps I may briefly explain the position. Questions relating to all matters over which the Secretary of State has executive responsibility will, of course, be addressed to him. The list of such functions will be made out in the transfer of functions Order, as my right hon. Friend explained. In addition, he will answer Questions involving the activity of more than one Department in Wales. This is an aspect of his essentially co-ordinating function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, by arrangement with the Ministers executively concerned—that is, Ministers for the non-transferred Departments—my right hon. Friend may answer a Question on a matter outside his own executive responsibility but one of special concern to Wales. These arrangements in the House and Grand Committee, at Question time and on the Adjournment, will have to be worked out in the light of experience, but I believe that we have the essential basis for a workable Parliamentary technique at the beginning of this new constitutional development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point on which my right hon. Friend wanted me to speak and which some hon. Members have raised individually with us is that of information. It is our intention to do our best to improve and expand the means of information to Members of the Committee and to the House. As hon. Members will recall, we have two main publications every year relating to Welsh Affairs. One is the Annual Report on Government Activity in Wales and the other is the Welsh Digest of Statistics. We propose to retain both publications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual White Paper is a useful general survey. It was never intended to be more than a general survey. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
hope to expand the Welsh Digest of Statistics so that it becomes more comprehensive, adding certain tables which many hon. Members feel should be included. We do not think we can emulate the Scottish Office, at least within a measurable period, in producing such a digest of statistics twice yearly, although I and many hon. Members would very much like this because the progressive indices change rapidly and certainly more than twice a year. I think, however, that we can undertake to produce those two publications regularly and punctually. The Annual Report for the preceding calendar year will, I am advised, be published on St. David's Day. Thus there will be only a two or three months' lapse between the end of the year covered in the Report and its appearance before hon. Members. That will be a great improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ness Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be the report of the Secretary of State to the House of Commons, or will it be a report of a collection of heads of Departments in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Annual Report will, for the next two or three years at least, proceed in its present form. Secondly, the Welsh Digest of Statistics will also be published every year covering the financial year and will appear at least as early as September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there will be the kind of publication which my right hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly has mentioned, namely, the Secretary of State's own Departmental report. My right hon. Friend rather jumped the gun, but he is absolutely with me on this. The third publication, which is a new one for us, but which is traditional in the sense that each Departmental Minister produces one, will be the Departmental report. Whether that will cover housing and local government and roads in a single volume or whether two Departmental reports will be presented by the Minister, who, in each case, is the Secretary of State for Wales, is a matter for consideration. That is a detail on which hon. Members may have views. If so, we shall be delighted to hear them. I do not consider it to be vastly important, but hon. Members are free to put their views forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
Fourthly on the question of information, apart from the annual report, the expanded digest and the Departmental reports relating to the transferred executive Departments which I have just mentioned, we feel that there is need from time to time to produce specific papers on specific aspects of Government activity in Wales which may lie outside the executive responsibility of the Secretary of State. For example, the question of education has been raised. The Secretary of State's powers of oversight over education and science are very real ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister's statement should be studied carefully, for there is evidence in it that he lays great stress on there being this association between the Secretary of State for Wales and the Secretary of State for Education and Science in, as it were, jointly promoting the work of the Department in Wales. As time goes on I think we shall see that this power of oversight will prove to be an extremely valuable and important one. That is not to decry arguments for further transfer of power. This is the beginning. I hope that hon. Members will apply their minds to possibilities of further transfer.

A point that must be dealt with before I close is the question of the future of the Council for Wales. I have no time to do more than indicate our thinking on this matter. We feel that the Council of Wales, since it inception under a Labour Government, has done valuable work of research and report. I should like to thank the present Chairman, Councillor Beeston, and those who have
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
served in the chair and as members from its inception, for the great contributions they have made in clarifying our thinking and occasionally in promoting reforms in Wales. Naturally, however, with the emergence of the new regional planning structure, the planning board and the advisory council, we must give thought to the future of the Council for Wales in relation to this new regional setup. We therefore hope that the Council will continue with its present work for about a year, during which it will produce a valuable report on the arts in Wales. During that time, we shall consider further its future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the Question, perhaps I may be allowed to thank right hon. and hon. Members on both sides for their very kind welcome to me in the Chair, which, I need hardly say, I greatly appreciate. Nothing could give me greater pleasure than to preside over the Welsh Grand Committee. I may say that the position of gamekeeper is something entirely new in my history and, if I may say so, in the history of my family.

Let me say, in the spirit of good will, before I put the Question, that I wish all Members of the Committee, Nadolig Llawen a Blwyddyn Newydd Dda a happy Christmas and a successful New Year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
