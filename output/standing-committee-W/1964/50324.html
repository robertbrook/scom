	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Mid-Wales development and depopulation problems.—	<i>[Mr. James Griffiths.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. James Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it would be convenient to the Committee today if I opened the debate and set out the proposals which the Government now want to submit to the Committee to deal with the problem of mid-Wales. I am grateful to hon. and right hon. Members opposite for their agreement to this course and for sacrificing their constitutional right to open the debate. I am anxious to afford the fullest opportunity to hon. Members to discuss the proposals which I shall set before them, and I will not detain the Committee longer than is necessary to explain what I propose. If I stick to my notes more than is normal to me with my temperament I hope that the Committee will understand. It will shorten my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to set out in any detail the nature and character of the problem that confronts us in mid-Wales. If it can be summed up briefly. It begins with economic decline leading to depopulation, the flight of the young in search of work and livelihood, leaving behind an ageing population. At present the proportion of those over 65 in mid-Wales is 20 per cent. above the average for England and Wales as a whole. Not only is it an ageing population. It is an impoverished population. The average income per head in mid-Wales is £132 per annum compared with £172 for the whole of Wales and Monmouthshire and £228 for England. The overall picture in mid-Wales is one of a vicious circle—(economic decline leading to depopulation, and depopulation leading to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
still further decline and to an ever-increasing drift away from the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem is how to break this vicious circle. By its nature and character the problem in mid-Wales is somewhat different from that which I and many of my hon. Friends were confronted with and still are confronted with in the industrial areas. There the problem was and still is in many areas that of how to bring work to the unemployed still living within the area. As I see it, the problem in mid-Wales is twofold: first to seek to bring as rapidly as possible work to those who remain in the area, and in particular to the youth, and secondly to provide a focal point or points of economic growth which would begin to turn the tide back to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here it is not only a problem of providing jobs but of providing men as well. This must be understood if we are to make, first, the right appraisal, and then apply the right solution to the problems of mid-Wales. I recognise that this is a tough job. To reverse the trend which has gone on at an accelerated rate for several generations will call for long and sustained effort and will need the cooperation of all concerned—the central Government, the local authorities, industrialists and workers. It will require the good will and co-operation of all the people, not only in mid-Wales, and not only in Wales as a whole, but also of our fellow-citizens the other side of Offa's Dyke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ever since I became Secretary of State for Wales my desire has been to start on this job because 	<i>Deuparth gwaith yw ei ddechrau</i> or, a job begun is two-thirds done. I want the Committee to regard what I say this morning as the beginning of what I hope the Committee will realise will be a long job. It is a job which can be done and a job which can begin now and must continue with unabated effort for many years. This is why, since I took up office and set up the Welsh Planning Board, my first remit to the Board was to consider the problems of mid-Wales and submit its report to me. I should like to express my gratitude to the members of the Board for the speed with which they have worked. They submitted their report to me on 11th February. They considered that what was needed in mid-Wales was a range of mutually supporting measures, each
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
designed to complement and supplement the others and all adding up to the beginning of a comprehensive plan to deal with all the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to bring new growth and new vitality to this area we must take care that we safeguard the base and make full use of its existing resources. I begin, therefore, by saying something about the base. Agriculture is still the basic industry of mid-Wales. It will be strengthened and it has been strengthened, particularly since 1947, by the proposals initiated by the Labour Government for assisting small and hill farmers. This has been continued by the late Government and it is acknowledged that this has helped agriculture in mid-Wales. Everyone realises, however, that increased efficiency may mean less employment. This is a feature with which we are becoming familiar not only in agriculture but in other industries. But efficient it must be, otherwise it will not survive. Whilst we realise that it is our duty to make it efficient we also know that it will create human and social problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone who knows mid-Wales and other parts of our lovely country will know that in recent years forestry has made a valuable contribution not only to providing employment but to improving amenity and to making the lovely country still lovelier. Responsibility for forestry is one of the responsibilities which have been transferred to me as Secretary for State. I shall be considering future plans with the Forestry Commission and my colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday I had the privilege of visiting at Gwydyr. I visited the Forestry School and met the students. I was disturbed to find so few Welsh students there. I appeal to those who are engaged in education and to parents to realise that here is an opportunity for an interesting and adventurous career. I was impressed by the enthusiasm of the pupils there, including the Welsh pupils, and I hope that next time I go there I shall be able to meet more Welsh students. Forestry will still have a part to play, although of course there are problems and difficulties, not least that of securing land, to which I am giving my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mid-Wales has great natural beauty which makes it an ideal area in which the tourist industry can be developed. As the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
East (Sir K. Joseph) knows, for he took the final steps, the development of tourism in the area began with the Welsh Council and its recommendations. The Welsh Tourist Board is at present conducting investigations and I should like to thank the parent body for seconding one of the ablest young officers to conduct the survey and make a study of the holiday potential of Wales. I look forward with great interest to the report. Tourism too has its part to play in the lovely area of mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone is familiar, and perhaps no one more than I, with the fact that whatever mid-Wales lacks it does not lack water. I want to see the best use made of it, and not only to provide water for consumption for people and for industry. I have been impressed by the recreational opportunities which water provides. I was glad to see the Forestry Commission creating a picnic centre near the Gwydyr Forest so that people may be given the opportunity to enjoy recreational facilities there. I commend the Commission upon their imaginative plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the subject of a new town. I do not propose to argue this morning whether it is desirable or not. It may be that the argument in future will be whether it should be a town or a city. I propose to indicate to the Committee that the time has come to do a practical job. This is the next and appropriate stage under the machinery of new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tell the Committee about the steps which I am taking now. I am appointing consultants to carry out the necessary detailed study of the most suitable locality, which may, of course, be the site of an existing town. I hope to make these appointments very shortly. The consultants will make proposals to me about the location, the size, the nature and the rate of build-up of this new development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will also be necessary to study the practicability of securing the required movement of industry and population. I emphasise again that if this is to be done we must bring industry and men to the area. It is my desire that this work shall be carried out in the closest association with the interests and people concerned in Wales, with industrialists
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
and others, with local authorities, and indeed with industrialists and local authorities in the Midlands. I shall do this in consultation with the First Secretary and arrange for it to be done quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word of advice to my compatriots as well as to hon. Members, and for the moment I am looking at the Liberal Members. I ask them for the sake of mid-Wales and its future not to lend themselves to a jealous campaign against the Midlands. It should be remembered that there are at least 50,000 of our compatriots in the Midlands who were compelled to leave mid-Wales to seek work. Many of them now occupy important positions in local government and elsewhere. All my colleagues from South Wales will remember, in our experience there in the last quarter of a century, how glad we were, and still are, to be able to induce industrialists from every part of the country to establish themselves in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced of the practicability of inducing industrialists to make this move, because I have had the opportunity more than once of visiting in mid-Wales existing factories built by the Development Commissioners. I was enormously interested in them. Every one I saw had been established in mid-Wales by industrialists from the other side of Offa's Dyke. I noticed one in Aberystwyth which had moved there from the Midlands. We welcome these factories, as indeed do the people of Aberystwyth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In looking to the years ahead—and I hope that we are planning for longer than my life and perhaps that of most of us here—I believe that great conurbations will move out of the Midlands and will move westward. Indeed, this is already happening. As hon. Members know, a move is now being planned to Dawley, 25 miles from the Welsh Border. We must look to the future. The consultants will look at sites and so on and then make a study of this very important practical problem, for success depends upon the movement of men and of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Keith Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
way. I may have taken down his words incorrectly, but did I understand him to say that he was not going to argue now whether a new town is desirable or not? Does he really expect the Committee to accept that he is going to shirk all the great issues of whether a new town is the right solution for mid-Wales and where it fits into the priorities of Government as a whole—that is to say, with his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and himself? Where does it fit in as a priority? Is he simply going to pass on to where such a new town might be and the logistics of it if it were decided that it would be desirable and if it had a high priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed this before. I discussed this problem at the last Sitting of the Grand Committee. What I am announcing now are the next steps to be taken, first of all, to appoint consultants, and secondly, to make arrangements by which a study will be made in order that we may make it a practical and effective proposition. I want to build a successful town. I want to build a live town. I do not want to build a phantom city. I want to build a real community, and these are the steps I am taking. It is now accepted by most people in mid-Wales, as elsewhere, that if we can do this—and I hope we can after all the steps we are taking—it will make a very valuable contribution to the solution of the problem of mid-Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said he disapproved of attacks on the Midlands. Would he really regard the statement that mid-Wales must primarily be planned from the point of view of the welfare of Wales as a whole as an attack on the Midlands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read these documents where they talk about a satellite for mid-Wales, and things of that kind. That is all. I am sure that hon. Members' constituents are very glad indeed that firms have come from the Midlands and established businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise at once that among the problems confronting us here—in which I am very anxious to help—a practical step is to strengthen the existing towns in the area. I have given a good deal of thought to this. I am convinced that the best way to do this at this stage is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
expand the work so well begun by the Development Commissioners in conjunction with the mid-Wales Development Association. I am glad to be able to say that after discussions with me and my colleagues the Development Commissioners have agreed to increase their efforts in this direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now, they have been able to provide about 100 new jobs a year. It is their hope—and they are working to this end—to double this in future and to provide 200 jobs a year. In this work the Development Commissions will be helped, as they are now, by the Board of Trade and other Government Departments concerned. It is important that they should be given, as I am sure they will be, the closest co-operation of local authorities, and in particular of the local housing authorities. I would express my thanks to the Development Commissioners for proposing this expansion and doubling the programme. By doing this, I believe we shall reach the stage at which these developments will begin to develop a momentum of their own. That is how economic growth proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years it has been my privilege to be associated, sometimes officially and many times voluntarily, with promoting economic growth in the underdeveloped countries. I have always been attracted by the imaginative idea that what we have to do is to promote economic growth to the stage when they take off themselves. By developing in this way, modest as it may seem, these developments will generate their own growth, and will expand themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that by using existing organisations rather than creating new ones, and using local initiative, we shall make a real contribution to the economic development and will thus provide jobs for the young people. To quote from personal experience, I have been deeply impressed by the way in which the young people I saw in the factories in mid-Wales have shown the capacity and the ability to learn new skills and crafts. These will bring them added opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have elsewhere paid—and I do here again this morning—tribute to the excellent work of the mid-Wales Industrial Development Association in publicising the attractions of the area, in encouraging industry to settle there, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
dealing with the problems—and there must be problems—of industrialists to establish themselves in new areas. I have been deeply impressed by its work. I have been very anxious to help it, and I am glad to be able to say to the Committee that to enable the Association to play an even fuller part in this work, and in my anxiety to increase the resources available to it, the Development Commissioners have indicated that they will be prepared to receive an application for substantial additional assistance to help the Association in its work. By strengthening it, and giving it even greater resources, added to the other things I have done, I believe it will continue to play a very big part and become a very good medium through which the councils and people in this area will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lady Megan, what I am about to say will be of interest to you. I would like to refer to the Rural Industries Loan Fund, associated with your great father in the Act of 1909. It is appropriate that we should be using a Lloyd George Measure to help the land he loved. I have also discussed the rôle of this loan fund with the Development Commissioners. It does make a contribution, and it can help. They tell me that they recognise the need for improved loan facilities for small rural businesses in Wales. They expect shortly to be able to increase the funds available to the Rural Industries Loan Fund and to widen the scope of its work. That again will be an added contribution to the development of this area of mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise fully that a key feature of economic development in this area, as in Wales as a whole—and indeed in any area—lies in the development of communications. I have had an opportunity to meet industrialists and local authorities, and when I have asked them what they consider to be the greatest need to promote the further economic development of every part of Wales they have all replied with one word—communications. I have asked the Welsh Planning Board to make a thorough and speedy study of the problem of communications in Wales. It is part of the study which has been made all over England. I look forward to receiving its report. I realise that in all this communications are one of the most important—indeed, perhaps the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
most important—keys to economic development. For those reasons, I have asked the Welsh Planning Board to look at this vital problem and to report to me as soon as is practicable. When I receive its report, I shall then study it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On all these proposals and problems for expanding the growth of mid-Wales I shall be consulting the Welsh Economic Council. I am sure I can call upon its members' combined experience, good will and knowledge to help promote this work. My hon. Friend the Minister who will preside over this will, with the Planning Board, be discussing this and other problems very urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out briefly the Government's proposals. I commend them to the Committee and to the people of Wales. They are a beginning. It may be a modest beginning. I think it is what is required in mid-Wales. We have had our fill of reports; we have had plenty of grandiose paper plans. I would rather be associated with a real attempt and start to halt the drift, and an endeavour to turn the tide, a combined effort to bring new life and vitality into this lovely area. I want to make this a joint endeavour of Government, local authorities and individual citizens all working together. I would echo the words used by the Mid-Wales Industrial Development Association in its excellent brochure:
	<br><q><p>"In the end the development of mid-Wales will not depend on any commission, bureau, council or association. It will depend on the outlook of the people in the area, their readiness to accept change and above all to grasp the new opportunities opening up for them. It will depend on their determination to re-invigorate rather than to preserve their way of life."</p></q>
I conclude by recalling that a quarter of a century ago it was my privilege, speaking for the second time only from a Front Bench, to open a debate in the House on the report of our late colleague and friend, Clement Davies, on the problem of T.B. in Wales. We called that the decline: We had come to accept it as a fate. That report was the turning point. We began to realise that this was not a fate, that it was a man-made problem and could be conquered by man. We look back over 25 years, and we look at Wales today. If we have not conquered it entirely, the scene has changed. The decline is no longer a fate which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
we cannot combat. It is a disease which we can eradicate. We are eradicating it. It is now our job to look with the same spirit and the same resolve at this disease of economic decline. This, too, is man-made. This, also, can be cured by man. It is my hope that what I have announced will be the beginning of a combined effort to cure it and bring new life and vitality to this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, we have listened to the Secretary of State with delight. I do not think there is anybody making a speech to whom I would rather listen. That does not mean that I agree with everything he says. Indeed, during the course of my few remarks I shall put one or two questions to him on the Government's propositions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all I would say what a pity we think it is that this Grand Committee today has to take place at a time when the House itself is sitting. Of course, we hope that we shall not be sinterrupted; it will be a pity if we are interrupted in the short time we have at our disposal. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman did say to his Cabinet colleagues that it would be a nuisance to the Welsh Members. Indeed, the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Newport (Sir F. Soskice) and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) have now to be in the Chamber for subjects for which they are responsible. We regret that, and we hope that we shall not be caused to leave this Committe. This is not just an ordinary Standing Committee. As we all know, it is a Grand Committee, which the Conservatives had the honour and pleasure of setting up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the Committee will forgive me if I speak on this subject this morning with a certain depth of feeling. Anyone who has been brought up in the area we are discussing, anybody who knows the hills, rivers, the woods and the people of that area, as well as I do myself—and indeed, as do other Members of the Committee—must realise that we are dealing with a problem which is essentially a human one, as the right hon. Gentleman has said. Moreover, it is a problem we should approach first and foremost with those people particularly in mind. In my view, the emphasis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
should be on helping the people who live and work there. As for the people who come from outside, they are very important, they are members of our country; but that is a secondary consideration when we are considering the problems of mid-Wales. The Government's job, as I see it, is how best to improve their lot and to find employment for the rising generation there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not underestimate the work which has already gone on. In my reasonably short lifetime I have seen the small industries in mid-Wales go—tanneries, saw mills, cloth mills. Even a corn, mill half a mile from my own home is no more. The building is still there, but there is no industry in it. Therefore, we also have to balance what has been done over past years. This has not been a problem which has been neglected by the previous Government. Far from it. If one reads the excellent report of the Mid-Wales Industrial Development Association, one sees that since 1957 24 industries of various sorts have been brought in employing at the moment up to about 1,000 people, and in the next few years there will be an extra 500. There certainly has not been inaction. The Report shows action—action which we wish to see increased as the years go by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman said in his speech, the tragedies of unemployment in the old days were such that the problems—perhaps he did not exactly say this, but I will—of depopulation could not receive quite the same attention as at the present time. If one is facing an essentially human tragedy such as unemployment, that represents a far greater tragedy than actual depopulation. Therefore, it is only due to the fact that over a long period of time the employment position has been considerably improved that we have been able to give our attention in the last few years to the question of depopulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter we should take note of is that in the United Kingdom the total population per square kilometre is in the region of 309 persons, which is almost the largest population density in the world. There is only one larger, and that is Holland where the figure is 351 persons per square kilometre. When we compare these figures with a population
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
density of 86 per square kilometre in France, we realise how heavily populated the whole of this country is. It is all the more remarkable when one realises that the population of mid-Wales has fallen by 12,000 in the last 13 years. We know the reasons for this well. They are the changes in agricultural practices and the size of holdings; high employment and good wages over a period of years in most of our largest cities, particularly in the Midlands, which have drawn away our young men and women from the mid-Wales area. Young people are less tied to their families and are much more mobile than they were forty years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, then, is the drift to be reversed? Before coming to the right hon. Gentleman's propositions and discussing them, I would say what our position is in this matter. During the election we made our view absolutely clear, that we thought this problem could best be cured by strengthening the existing fabric of towns in Wales. It has been started, and so it can be continued. All along, we have been rather uncertain and doubtful about the sense of creating a large new town in the centre of Wales. During the election right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite laid great stress on this. It was not a great vote winner, but it was something which they talked about. Perhaps since the election they have not been so certain that they want a completely new town, or whether they want to increase the size of an existing one. The right hon. Gentleman did not really today come out and take the political decision, which he alone can take, as to whether there is going to be a new town and where it is going to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the confusion arises because when we use the term "new town" we ought to add "new town machinery". It is, of course, possible to build an entire new town on a new site, but it is also possible to expand an existing town. This is what has been done in the past; most of the new towns have been set up through the expansion of an existing town. When the study by the consultants takes place it will include the study of existing towns, and whether one of them should be selected from this expansion. Let me make that clear now. I thought I made it clear before. Under the New Towns Act it is possible to expand an existing town, and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
indeed, recently announcements have been made of substantial expansions of towns in this way. Both methods, a new town which is built on to an existing town, or a new town on a new site, are possible. The consultants will look at both methods when they make their examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the powers of the New Towns Act. With respect, the right hon. Gentleman has not taken the political decision. He should not be upset because I upbraid him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not upset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is rather like a bather at Aberystwyth—first putting his toe in the water and then putting in his foot afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very wise in Aberystwyth!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to Aberystwyth in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He really must face the fact that sooner or later, having had the advice of his consultants—he has not yet told us who his consultants may be, whether they are part of his Planning Board or people within the Ministry; no doubt he will tell us sooner or later—he will have to take the political decision as to where that town is going to be, and whether it is going to be a new town or a town grafted on to an existing one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then we are agreed that we have not yet reached that position. I am glad hon. Gentlemen opposite are supporting me in my argument. We shall, therefore, look forward to a further debate on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, we wish to see the existing fabric of the towns increased, places like Llandrindrod, Newton, Welshpool, Aberystwyth, too, with the towns in that area being greatly strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing which is essential is that we must have what we have heard called a safeguarding of the base. We must see that agriculture is continually supported. The right hon. Gentleman was a little bit rosy in what he said about agriculture in Wales at the present time. If he were to go now and talk to Welsh farmers I do not think that he would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
receive quite the applause that he might expect. Farm Price Reviews vary from time to time, and it is a difficult problem for the right hon. Gentleman. I hope that, in spite of the fact he is not executively responsible for agriculture in Wales, he supported the Minister of Agriculture in these difficult times which he has just gone through. Let there be no doubt about it, that the question of under-recoupment in regard to the new Price Review and the question of the price margin in relation to milk—and there are many milk farmers in Wales—is giving considerable concern to those on the land in Wales. This has its effect on the ancillary trades such as those of butchers, bakers, freezers—and even the creamery at Builth Wells. Can that continue unless a good and successful dairy industry is kept going in that area? These are big and difficult decisions to have to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman spoke on the question of forestry. In his newfound responsibility, in which I delight and on which I congratulate him, what he has said about the Welsh trainees is true. We would all like to see many more young Welsh foresters. We would like to see a tradition of forestry, a tradition which at present we lack in Wales. This is not to say that much has not already been done. We hope that it will continue to be done. There is a very great need to keep the day-to-day working relationship between forestry and agriculture in Wales as close as possible. I very much hope that, in the situation of the present time, when the right hon. Gentleman has not the executive responsibility for agriculture but possesses it in regard to forestry, he will see that the effects of the change in the functions of these two industries, which must go hand in hand, will be alleviated as much as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of light industries in the towns of mid-Wales is one which should be dealt with. The right hon. Gentleman did not say where the new town was going to be—and I am not going to tell him either, because I do not believe that we should have a new town—but if it is intended that we should have a new town, we must consider the matter carefully. Some people might say that it should be in Montgomeryshire. Montgomeryshire, throughout the years, has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
been asking for a new town, and has led the way on this matter, particularly when we remember the speeches by the late Member for Montgomery, Mr. Clement Davies, and indeed by his successor, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that Montgomery is now asking that Aberystwyth should be developed to a huge town with a population of at least 250,000? How would that affect Montgomery, I wonder?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that in a moment. I was putting forward a hypothesis in considering whether this large town should or should not go to Montgomeryshire, and, if so, how it would affect the area. I was merely saying that over the years Montgomery had had a large say in this matter, and good luck to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A large town in Montgomeryshire or anywhere else would be a great disadvantage. It would attract a great number of people off the hills and from the small villages in that county, and it would not help the other counties in mid-Wales. We realise how isolated we are. If we live in Radnorshire we like to go to Montgomery, or to Cardigan. But it is over the hill, and one cannot see people commuting from Radnor and north Breconshire to a large town in Montgomery. That is the reason we wish to see industry spread throughout the area and not concentrated in one town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. S. O. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. S. O. Davies).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To come back to the Government's proposals, the Government say that they are going to have a new town. As I have said, they have not said whether if is going to be a new town in the strict sense, or whether it should be added to an existing town. Where does the priority for this new town in mid-Wales come in the national plan? Has the right hon. Gentleman got down to it with his colleague, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. George Brown), the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs? It would appear to me that it would be a difficult thing to advance the claims of a mid-Wales new town where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
there is virtually no unemployment, if, at the same time, in the North, and in Scotland, there are areas which are crying out for industry and for expansion of towns. I feel the right hon. Gentleman will have a difficult time to advance the claims of this new town with his colleague the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, whereas if he went for our suggestion and asked for more smaller towns I would have thought he would get away with it rather easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman spoke of giving scope to the Rural Industries Loan Fund and of widening the scope of the Fund's work. It is not possible to say much in one speech, but we should like to be told more about that, about altering the scope, altering the type of work being done. It could provide an important contribution, and we shall look forward to hearing more in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the attitude of my friends in the Liberal Party. As usual, they try to do things bigger and better than anybody else. They are not content with strengthening existing towns, not content with saying they will have a big town somewhere sometime. They say, "We will have a large town in Aberystwyth and eventually build it up to 250,000 people". I do not know how this is being received in Aberystwyth itself. I do not know whether the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) will be able to tell us whether they are looking forward to being 250,000 in 20 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The claims of Aberystwyth were put forward in the most colourful way. I like Aberystwyth. I like going there for a day and coming home again. But it is asking a great deal of a quarter of a million people to go and make their permanent home there. I see some of the credentials of Aberystwyth have been pretty well written up: Aberystwyth has a very good climate; it has long hours of sunshine; it is relatively ice and snow free and completely fog free. What it did not go on to say was the reason why Aberystwyth is fog free. Anyone who stood on the Marine Parade would know the reason—the wind is Force 8. I am not running Aberystwyth down. There are many things to be said for it. Another thing which was not mentioned is the rainfall.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
If people are to be moved from the Midlands or west Midlands the rainfall is something which must be considered. It is rather like moving sheep from the lowlands into the hills: they have to have a different wool before they go there. Whereas the average rainfall in my constituency of Hereford is between 28 in. and 29 in., the average rainfall in Aberystwyth is between 45 in. and 50 in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to see Aberystwyth built up, particularly on the educational side for which it has such a reputation. Men such as Sir George Stapledon, who did more to revolutionise British agriculture in the last fifty years than any other man in the country, are of the type of man Aberystwyth has sheltered and nurtured, and I would be the last person to say that Aberystwyth is not a very good place; but it is wrong of the Liberal Party to exaggerate its attraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will finish, as, indeed, the right hon. Gentleman did, with the question of communications. Rather than put this question last, I feel both of us ought to have put it first. Before we consider the building up of 12 towns, or any unspecified number of towns, the question of communications must be considered. The question of which are the most important roads to develop is most important. I have said before that in my view the east-west roads are more important than the north-south roads. Where does the produce of mid-Wales go to? Where does the milk from northern Carmarthenshire go to? It goes to London. Where does the mature timber go to? It happens to go to saw mills in the Border country. Therefore I would say to the right hon. Gentleman that I hope that in his consultations, and in his new responsibilities for roads, he will lend an ear to this view that the east-west roads should undoubtedly come before the north-south roads. I do not say the north-south roads are not important, but if there is only a certain amount of money available from the central Government, from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we know well there have to be priorities, and if there have to be priorities I do beg the right hon. Gentleman, from the economic angle and the tourist angle, to remember that east-west roads in the long-term will help mid-Wales most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made some fairly controversial remarks about various sides of the prob-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
lem. The mid-Wales Industrial Development Association has done a great job, and I am glad to know the Minister is supporting it and increasing its powers. This must be right. I am sure local authorities and individuals in central Wales will continue to work with it in order to find the right answer. I do say to the right hon. Gentleman that we had hoped to hear rather more from him today. He is stepping rather carefully, and we shall look forward to hearing from him at the earliest opportunity what he has decided. This, after all, is a political decision. It is hedged around with thorns, with the interests of counties and various authorities. I beg of him to make a decision on this, and when he has done so to give us the opportunity of debating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope his colleague, the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State, will be able in his speech later on to answer some of the questions I have put before him. This is a matter which affects the life of the whole of Wales. It is something which, till we can improve it, we shall continually be aware of and be ashamed of. There is a measure of agreement throughout the Principality as a whole that the sooner we can find the right answer, difficult and complicated as it is, the better will the Welsh people be pleased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know there are a great many hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the whole Committee will have listened with enthusiasm to the announcement which has been made by the Secretary of State making it clear that practical steps are being taken to see that the question of growth of new towns, or that the growth of an old town, is now coming into the realms of political practicability. When this question was being put forward by the Secretary of State I found myself in complete agreement when he stressed that nothing could be worse than attempting to look at the problem of any new town in Wales without taking into account the neighbouring conurbations in the Midlands or Lancashire. I would expect no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
less a comment from the Secretary of State who has again and again drawn attention in the House of Commons to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a necessary comment to be made for we have had during recent months the xenophobia of self-styled Welsh nationalists, a xenophobia which has prompted some leaders to protest against any new town being sited in mid-Wales if this is to lead to large numbers of English coming into the locality. This is a grave disservice to the Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider, too, that the absurd chauvinism of the Liberal fantasy of a new town in Aberystwyth founded on the declared hostility to Birmingham is an insult to the intelligence and pragmatism of the Welsh people. Liberals show an unrestrained enthusiasm for Europe, and it is notorious that, unabashed, they are quite prepared to embrace Paris, Rome or Brussels, hoping for liaison upon any terms they can get, but the thought of an embrace with Birmingham sends them panic stricken to their mountain ewes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to understand some of the problems of mid-Wales we need to draw some lessons from the problems of South Wales and Monmouthshire. In South Wales and Monmouthshire, unless we have a source of trained young labour coming from outside Wales into our mines, the middle-aged and older miners will get stranded in the pits there which are becoming uneconomic because of shortage of labour. Unless we can have some reaffirmation of the production target, recognition of the need for higher wages, and reconstruction of capital I am unconvinced that the drift of young men from the mines which is going on will not be arrested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have some 800,000 to 1 million immigrants from the Commonwealth, and I believe no prejudice must inhibit consideration being given to whether many of these young men, after appropriate training, could make a contribution to our mines in South Wales and so save the older miners from the employment hazards. The situation is such that if the present drift continues the mines could be closed in twelve years. France, Germany, Belgium could not have advanced without large-scale immigration, nor in my opinion can Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
In mid-Wales the most important inhibiting factor from the industrialist's point of view is shortage of labour, which leads to difficulty in mounting any large new enterprises. This is a factor of economic life, and it cannot be evaded any more than the fact that an industrialist who may be keen to establish himself elsewhere wants to establish himself within a reasonably short distance from his markets, his suppliers and, in the case of a branch factory, his parent firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that if a new town is to be established successfully it has to be in the Border country within range of the sphere of interest of Midlands and Lancashire firms. There are compelling economic arguments for establishing a new town in the Border area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a Labour Government which drafted the Bill which became the New Towns Act. It was the brain child of Hugh Dalton; the Act was eventually brought in by a Conservative Government. But it was our imaginative concept to help to deal with the conurbations by moving people over short distances so that we might allow people to get away from the unfortunate life so many of them have to endure because they have to live in miserable conurbations. It is in keeping with our past tradition that we should be thinking of how we could give aid on a United Kingdom basis to those who are crowded and oppressed in their way of life inside areas like Lancashire and the Midlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 'thirties, as the Secretary of State has reminded us, Welsh people had to come to Birmingham for work; they were driven out of Wales. In my youth, how many of my colleagues had to leave in order to find work, and to go to Birmingham? It is time they came back, and if they come back with Englishmen so much the better. It is time that we began to think in terms of whether we could not implement still further the New Towns Act so that overspill agreements, allied perhaps with more positive action from the Government as far as industry is concerned, could mean that we could bring into these Border counties more labour, more work, thus making our contribution by relieving the problems of the conurbations and at the same

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
time by establishing real and economically viable growth points inside Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representing as I do a constituency in Monmouthshire, the most populous of all the Border counties, I regard it as an impertinence to suggest that Wales would not benefit by an influx from outside regions. The blunt fact is that Wales has a great tradition of absorption from outside. From the time the Flemish settled in Pembrokeshire, and the Irish arrived to help to build the ports of Swansea and Cardiff, in Wales integration of different groups has been achieved. I know how the German and the Czechoslovakian Jews who escaped Hitler's holocaust helped to build the trading estates. We know how Somalii and Adenese sailors made their contribution in merchant ships during the war, and have settled in Barry and in Cardiff. We know that the Italians have endowed us with restaurants, and in the postwar years the Poles have also made their contribution to the labour force.

Monmouthshire, from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, has gathered in people from every region, and Cwmbran, the only new town in Wales, which I have the honour to represent, is following in that tradition. A recent survey of Cwmbran New Town revealed that two out of three of the families come from outside South Wales. Cwmbran can revel in the religious and regional diversities which it has got. There is nothing unhealthy at this particular time in saying this. We are not indulging in the chauvinism in which the Liberal Party has been indulging in discussing the problems of mid-Wales recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the consultants are considering this problem they will keep in mind the problem which engaged the House of Commons yesterday. Everyone who participated rationally in the discussion on the immigration problem at that time said that there was a need for dispersal. I know that no one will have more understanding of the problem of immigrants than the Secretary of State. No Colonial Secretary has shown more concern and regard for the developing peoples than he when he was holding that position. Therefore, I hope that in Wales, with its permissive and generous attitudes which have characterised it in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
the past, when we are talking in terms of a new town, we shall ask, particularly when we are near Birmingham and the Midlands, what contribution we can make towards the dispersal problem. When there are opportunities of mobilising social services and anticipating housing needs, we must ask ourselves whether, within the broad concept of a new town, we in Wales cannot make our own contribution to the problems of dispersing the immigrants who are now, as all have agreed, too heavily concentrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that the opportunities are great. If we found ourselves upon a broader basis than the conception of chauvinism there are opportunities, so long as we keep our feet on the ground and think of the venues and the sites which are economically viable. If we indulge ourselves in false romanticism we shall do no service to Wales. I believe that we shall achieve nothing of real value without a practical and pragmatic approach, and with an understanding that Wales belongs to the United Kingdom. By such an approach we may yet see emerging from the speech of the Secretary of State a real vision which will be fulfilled, that of a new town inside Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) speaks with great experience of the new town which he represents, Cwmbran, but I am quite sure he will be the first to agree that the problems of Cwmbran—if indeed there are any, as it has a low rate of unemployment—are somewhat different from the problems we are considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing we have to get into our minds when considering the problem of rural depopulation in mid-Wales is that this is not one which is confined to Wales. It occurs in other parts of the United Kingdom and in many other parts of the world. Nor is sparsity of population confined to mid-Wales, for whilst it is a well-known fact that the population of six of our Welsh counties is rather less than that of the City of Cardiff we have to bear in mind also that the Scottish Highlands, which occupy a sixth of the land of the United Kingdom, contain rather fewer residents than the London Borough of Wandsworth, which I think, has a population of about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
300,000. When one remembers that 40 per cent. of the population of England and Wales live in 4 per cent. of the area of England and Wales it is hardly surprising that we face problems of the type we are considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mid-Wales Industrial Development Association Report, "Depopulation in mid-Wales", which was produced in about the middle of last year, outlines the two essential requirements to effect any worthwhile improvement in the situation: first, a reduction in the existing scatter of population into larger and fewer settlements; secondly, more employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst the Report points out that the concentration of these scattered units throughout mid-Wales would mean cheaper and better services and social amenities, the Association also takes the realistic view that such a reorganisation is bound to pose human and social problems. Also, it is a policy that must necessarily be considered to be a very long-term one. I think that was emphasised by the Secretary of State this morning. In my opinion, the problem as we face it today is insoluble in the short-term view unless we can devise some miraculous method of creating such attractive employment opportunities and such pleasant living conditions that people will go to a new town of their own volition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of varied employment opportunities I think there is more scope and some possibility of success. Indeed, it is pertinent that I should mention the excellent efforts of the last Government in this respect. I would remind the Committee that in the period between 1951 and 1959 they spent on building and civil engineering works in Wales a sum of £56 million, or £315, per head of the population as against the United Kingdom average of £260 per head of the population. I do agree that the £56 million includes a sum of £20 million which was spent by the Central Electricity Generating Board on large electrical installations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 8 of this Report emphasises that the most inhibiting factor again new industries coming into Wales is the shortage of labour. It reports that the total unemployment for the whole of mid-Wales fluctuates from 800 in the summer to approximately 1,400 in the winter, despite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
the injection of some 1,500 school leavers each year. It is the smallness of these numbers of unemployed, so thinly spread over a wide area, that creates the great difficulties facing manufacturers in moving into the areas. Therefore it follows that the establishment of new industry in mid-Wales of any worthwhile size must—as we have heard from several speakers this morning—involve the importation of labour from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is to be the policy of the Government, and I think a gradual expansion is the only feasible policy at the present time, we must appreciate that even this modified policy will create a good deal of heart searching in the area. Expanded towns, involving the influx of new people from outside areas, inevitably mean towns of a different character and in the initial stages, this is bound to cause a certain amount of friction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the alternative chosen by the Government is a new town—whether a new town entirely, or the expansion of an existing town. Despite the serious differences which have arisen—they have not been so noticeable this morning but they do exist on the other side of the Committee—I am bound to say that I feel this was rather a rash commitment, undertaken for election purposes prior to the General Election, and one about which they are very unhappy at the present time. I think that a new town as defined by the Government is impracticable and they are being rather hoist by their own petard in having to pursue a rash election promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the Secretary of State today, when he told us he had a statement to make, would have said that the area of mid-Wales had been designated as a development area. I hope that this may still be under consideration. In a development area, the emphasis is always to bring industry to the workers, but a new town project involves a much more ambitious policy because it means that both industry and workers have to be brought to areas of large scale development, and the best possible use has to be made of the natural resources of the area. The whole success of any new town project must hinge on its being able to provide sufficient industry to ensure that the large influx of population will find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
employment there, for I do not think that any residents of a new town project are going to be very happy if they are persuaded to move there and then find that the jobs are not there to keep them fully employed. It is fair to say that we all know that the natural resources of mid-Wales are rather limited; if they are there, they are very hard to find and difficult to exploit. Therefore, it has to depend on industry coming in from outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect, I think we are entitled to ask the Secretary of State what type of industry he anticipates will come to mid-Wales, from where it will come, and how it is to be persuaded to move into this area. Is some form of compulsion envisaged? We remember that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan) referred to the direction of industry prior to the last election, although we have not heard very much about it since. If this elusive industry is found, from where will it get the workers, from the surrounding areas or other industrial centres? The hon. Gentleman the Member for Pontypool has referred to that matter. Will they include foreign and coloured workers? One does not seek to be contentious about this, but we in South Wales remember the conspicuous lack of success we had when we tried to introduce Italian mine workers into the mines of South Wales. Presumably some of the workers will be provided from other industries, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) reminded us, from the farms in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder how the farmers of mid-Wales will react to this. As we know, the Government are already very unpopular with the farmers, and not least with the farmers of Wales. I read in their magazine "The Land" recently that they had been up to London to see the Welsh Parliamentary Party. I was not present at the meeting but, according to the magazine, the party immediately recommended that the Minister should meet representatives of the Union before the end of the Price Review talks. The article concluded by saying
	<br><q><p>"In the words of Mr. George Brown, 'We are on our way, brothers.'"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
I wonder where they were on their way to and whether they were joining in the march of the ratepayers and council house tenants who are so dissatisfied with the conduct of this Government. The Secretary of State referred to efficiency in agriculture creating a certain amount of unemployment, but surely he does not envisage any large-scale unemployment on this score. If he does, this would be something which would have to be reviewed by the Economic Planning Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a nutshell, I believe that the new town, as we have heard it described, is a non-runner. We should be far better off if we concentrated on the development of certain key selected areas in Wales. First, we should concentrate as far as possible on existing industries before we bring in new ones. I want to see mid-Wales designated as a development area, and even then we must choose very carefully the industries we bring in. It has been suggested that there should be improvements of road communications, particularly by providing arteries to the main industrial centres and ports. The tourist industry would benefit from some improvements in the coastal roads. It has always seemed to me that these rather attractive roads along the west coast could be widened at no great cost so as to take more traffic than they do at present. It is necessary, particularly for the sake of young people, that we should remove many of the anomalies which exist in our life in Wales and which, I am afraid, cause people in other areas sometimes to brand us as hypocrites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were absolutely right to tackle the problems of mid-Wales. They are difficult problems. We do not underestimate the Government's task, but I think also that they are realistic enough to recognise that there is no easy solution and no quick panacea for these difficult problems. I hope, therefore, that they will be persuaded to abandon any wildcat schemes for new towns and centrate instead on the expansion of existing areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

water of England. The need to do this may be the result of excessive vocal enthusiasm at the Abertillery by-election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation which we are discussing is not one which existed in 1951 and was dealt with by the previous Government but one which exists now after we have had 13 years of Conservative Government. Perhaps we should remember that despite what the Conservatives did in their 13 years in office the rate of depopulation in Wales has actually doubled. The superficiality of their approach to the problems of Wales is seen when one tries to obtain essential information on the nature of the problems which arise there. In the last fortnight I have been trying to obtain information relevant to the problems of Wales. I have found it difficult to obtain information which I should have thought in 13 years someone would have found it necessary to compile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to find out what proportion of houses in each county were 90 years old. This is a social as well as an economic problem. I could not get the information only that 28 per cent. of houses in Wales were over 90 years old. I then asked for the figures for the county boroughs. I find that for Cardiff the figure is 17 per cent., for Newport 9 per cent., for Swansea 18 per cent., and for Merthyr Tydfil 55 per cent. The picture in mid-Wales is one of old houses largely concentrated in the rural areas, but we are not able precisely to pinpoint where these conditions exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to find out what proportion of houses in each county were without electricity or gas. Again I could not get adequate information. I had to be satisfied with the national figure: 3 per cent. of households in Wales are without either gas or electricity. That percentage does not sound very large, but bearing in mind that since gas and electricity are largely urban services it follows that the 3 per cent. are mainly located in the rural areas. This could conceivably cover 75,000 people in Wales who could be without gas and electricity, not without the one but without both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without adequate statistics one cannot make as full a comparison as one would wish on development in Wales. A comparison which can be made is of the complex nature of the disbalance not only socially but economically, a disbalance which makes one wonder when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
one compares areas even within the same county. To take first of all figures relating to the three counties with the greatest percentage of depopulation, Merioneth, Radnor and Montgomery, and the growth counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth. While the three counties of depopulation lost 5,800 people in 13 years of Conservative rule, the two growth counties gained 81,000. In other words, the pattern of expansion or development in the Welsh economy is that whilst the counties of depopulation were losing one out of the population, the growth counties were gaining 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not consider this to be a purely economic problem. It is largely a social problem as well, but today it has been treated mainly on the economic level. We are making a great mistake in doing this and, with the tolerance of hon. Members, I should like to explore further statistics for mid-Wales and make comparisons. It is not only a matter of the number of jobs. It has been suggested that we should put jobs in the area. This is not solely an economic problem but also one of the level of income that goes with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the election a Conservative spokesman made considerable use of a statistic that average earnings in Wales are slightly higher than they are in England, but in reply to a question which I asked in November or December I was told that if one removes steel from the Welsh figures the average earnings in Wales become 16s. 1d. lower than the average in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two significant features emerge. The first is that during 13 years of Conservative Government there was not the introduction and spreading on a wide base of prosperous industries in Wales as one has in England. There has also been the magnet of the coastal areas. Steel tends to be a peripheral income at the moment and consequently the substantial higher income from working in steel acts as a magnet drawing people down to the coastal fringe, particularly in the southeast of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I could not obtain information on old houses I tried to get information on new houses. Here an interesting dis-balance in development appears, because if one considers houses built since 1945 one finds that in Radnorshire one house in seven has been built since that date,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
in Merioneth one in seven and in Montgomeryshire one in six. But in Glamorgan one house in four has been built since 1945, and in Monmouth one in three. We therefore have much more modern housing in areas which are an attraction to population, and of course these areas also have far better amenities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is shown by other statistics which I managed to obtain about the availability of piped water. In Radnorshire one house in six has no piped water, in Merioneth one house in 12 and in Montgomeryshire one in four, but in Glamorganshire the proportion is one in 75 and in Monmouthshire one in 50. It is difficult to show which is cause and effect. This tends to be a circular situation. An area in which population declines lacks amenities while the area of expanding population has inevitably to build more houses. Therefore there is an accelerating social attraction to the growth areas of South Wales from the depopulation areas of mid-Wales. This was not helped by the housing programme of the previous Government, since they cut back housing to such a severe extent that in six years Wales lost the equivalent of one year's housing output.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you had not appealed, Lady Megan, to hon. Members to be careful of the time I could have given the Committee information about apprenticeship proportions to show how there is a disbalance. In Radnorshire and Merioneth, for example, there is not one technological college place. I could draw the social implications and point to the possible impact of this on parents and children when they are thinking of careers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should recognise that the problem of depopulation is not, however, solely the problem and mid-Wales. This is an attitude we slip into far too readily when we look at the economic and social problems of Wales. Depopulation is also a problem for west Wales. Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire have lost as many people as the other three counties I have mentioned. Further south there is also another population change in the valley areas of Glamorgan and Monmouth. There is a disproportionate growth there in the coastal fringe compared with the inland areas so that there is attraction within the counties to the coastal fringe. There
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
is attraction from the low-income labour-intensive industries characteristic of the valleys to the high-income capital-intensive industries of the coastal fringe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain factors will inevitably affect this, and we should consider them, because unless this point is taken into account the problem of depopulation, instead of getting better, is likely to become worse. The first of these is going to be the impact of the Severn Bridge itself. The Severn Bridge, unconnected with mid-Wales and with west Wales, is going to present a locational advantage for south-east Wales. That is going to draw people into that particular part of the country. In anticipation of this, the planning officer of Glamorgan in a recent report said that by the end of this century he would envisage there would be 250,000 in the population of Glamorgan, and of that 250,000 four out of five would be found, not in Glamorgan as a whole, but in the south-east corner of the county, in Bridgend, in Cardiff and in Barry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I just briefly mention the three solutions I see as essential here? One is adequate transport links. There are totally inadequate transport facilities. Of the 48 miles of four-lane, trunk and classified roads in the whole of Wales, 40 miles are in Monmouthshire and Glamorgan. Of the 160 miles of three-lane road, 120 miles are in Monmouthshire and Glamorgan. This shows the disparity of services which provide the economic pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we need the build-up of urban amenities. As I have said, electricity and gas are urban amenities. If the Committee is willing to accept my suggestion that there is a social as well as an economic element here, then surely the argument for building up our urban amenities must be justified. These amenities can only be provided on an urban basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third solution is the recasting of the urban redevelopment concept, not recasting on either the existing mould, as developed by the Conservative Government, nor on the blanket development areas we had under the previous Labour Government. They both had something to commend them, and there is everything to be said for an amalgamation of the two, that is to say a blanket area
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
which needs development, and within that blanket area a two-tier system pinpointing aid for special areas with special problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we are not going to hear that what is in danger is the Welsh way of life when we talk of developing mid-Wales. We are not talking of a chosen way of life; we are talking of an enforced way of living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderic Bowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the first Member for a constituency in the mid-Wales area to have had an opportunity of attempting to make a contribution to this debate I am tempted to follow some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams). He stressed the poverty of the mid-Wales area in relation to basic social services. I am quite certain there is very great strength indeed in what he had to say. I was hoping that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would have had something to say on the need to provide far greater resources to local authorities in mid-Wales to enable them to establish sound basic social services in their own areas. I hope that before the end of the debate the Minister of State may have something to say about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to confine my observations virtually to what the Secretary of State had to say to us. He gave us an analysis of the nature and character of the problem of depopulation in mid-Wales. I am quite certain no one in this Committee quarrels with his analysis of the problem. I hope I shall not be thought presumptuous if I say that I personally do not dispute the deep-seated anxiety of the Secretary of State about this problem, and his desire to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, I felt that the Secretary of State today was extremely embarrassed by the modesty of his own proposals. Taking the new town concept out of what he had to say—and I will deal with that in a moment—it is really just the same as it was before, with a little bit more. There is no new machinery, no new approach whatsoever, if one leaves aside the new town concept. The Secretary of State referred to agriculture, forestry, tourism, water, and the activities of the Development Commissioners. We have had all these, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
what has happened? The plain fact is that all the activities in that direction have not been able to arrest the drift of population. The situation has got steadily worse with all those factors existing in the economy for the last twenty-five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the new town, all that it is proposed to add in this field is an increase in the powers of the Development Commissioners and an extended grant to the Mid-Wales Industrial Development Association. Of course, the extended grant to the Industrial Development Association is something I welcome. The Association has done excellent work. It has not achieved profound results, but that is not its fault. It is said that the scope of the Development Commissioners' work is to be extended. They are now going to provide 200 jobs a year instead of 100 jobs a year. Is it really suggested that that is going to be a substantial contribution to the solution of the problem of depopulation in mid-Wales? When he was speaking to us in December of last year, the Secretary of State spoke of making a bold attack on the problem. Can he really describe this as a bold attack on the problem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me just analyse it a little further. He states that the Development Commissioners have been providing jobs for 100 in mid-Wales. How many of those have been men? A mere handful. Of the women, how many of them have been other than married women? Of course, providing factories which employ women, and establishing factories which employ married women, is a help to the economy, and we welcome that help, but is it really going to be any contribution towards stopping depopulation? Through the assistance of the Development Commissioners we had a factory in Aberystwyth, we had one at Lampeter, and there is shortly to be one at Cardigan. I doubt whether those three will provide 12 jobs for men in the county of Cardigan. To give an illustration, if the Price Review had the effect of driving people out of milk production, the number of jobs less in Felinfach will be more than the overall benefit of the factories developed by the Development Commissioners in the county. We should get this in its proper perspective. I do not want to condemn what has been done in relation to establishing factories, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
the plain fact is that so far they have made virtually no contribution to solving the problem of rural depopulation. The Secretary of State shakes his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says "no contribution". He surely does not want to overstate it. Is he not glad that there are these new factories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In mid-Wales every year 700 people leave agriculture, and 99 per cent of those are men. We have a drop through agriculture of 700, and what is proposed here is an increase of 100, of whom 95 per cent. will be women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Wales (Mr. Goronwy Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman about that last figure?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
It is quite clear that something far more dramatic needs to be done if we are to arrest the drift. The Secretary of State shakes his head, but I want to know what it is going to be and when it is going to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one respect the party in power has changed its mind, because before the election we were told by the Labour Party's Front Bench Spokesman, in the debate we had in July, 1964, on rural development in what he called a clear statement concerning Labour Party policy for mid-wales, that the problem of depopulation should be looked at in the same way as the problem of unemployment and given the same priority. He went on to say that the Local Employment Act, 1960, as amended in 1963, should be amended so as to enable areas of depopulation to be scheduled as development districts, and that the whole of mid-Wales would be scheduled as a development district if his party came into power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be most unfortunate if the very substantial benefits which would accrue if the whole of the mid-Wales area were scheduled as a development district were denied Wales, and that all that were substituted were an extension of the powers and scope of activities of the Development Commissioners. The plain fact is that mid-Wales has basic difficulties. Of course it has. But mid-Wales is competing on wholly unequal terms with areas of unemployment in attempting to attract industry. While she is competing on wholly unequal terms, she has not the remotest prospect of attracting industrialists to her area. I profoundly regret that this plank in Labour Party policy up to the time it came into power has apparently been thrown overboard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would just like to touch on one other matter. I entirely agree with what the Secretary of State had to say in relation to the need to strengthen existing towns. That is vitally important as far as the townships themselves are concerned, but equally important as far as the overall picture in relation to mid-Wales is concerned. I do urge the Secretary of State to reconsider what he is going to do in this regard, because what he has indicated at present is certainly not going
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
to make any material contribution towards strengthening the economy of existing townships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased with what he had to say about communications, and this is a really urgent problem. He really must get on with this problem. Whilst there may be marginal differences on certain matters, on the basic need there can be no dispute. There is a necessity to get on with the job. There really should be no dispute about that. The Secretary of State now has direct responsibility for road transport in Wales. As I understand it, we are to have a Welsh Vote for transport. I would like to know when we are going to be told what is to be devoted financially to Wales in 1965–66.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That clearly does not envisage any substantial north-south link or east-west link. If it does, I shall be corrected. So it means that nothing dramatic is to be done, or even commenced, in 1965–66. We are still to have surveys and reports, and so on. I urge the Secretary of State to get on with the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say one thing in relation to the new town. A great deal of sarcasm has been expressed in relation to the new town, mainly by people who are profoundly ignorant of conditions in Wales and the wishes of the mid-Wales people. It may well be desirable from the point of view of the economy of Britain and from the point of view of the needs of Birmingham that there should be a new town on the borders of Wales and England, as suggested by the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse). I do not dispute that for one moment, but that is not what we are concerned with today. I would not be opposed to a new town if it were in the overall interests of the economy of Britain and in the interests of solving Birmingham's housing problem and her problems of integration. What we are concerned with today is what contribution a new town is going to make in relation to depopulation in mid-Wales as a whole. If we put a large new town on the fringe of the English border it is going to increase the population there, but is it going to help in the overall problem of depopulation in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not abundantly clear that the establishment of Cwmbran in the area of Monmouthshire has played a major part in preventing migration from the whole of Monmouthshire? The consequence of growth points there is to prevent emigration out of the existing area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has indicated his ignorance of the position in mid-Wales. Does he realise that large parts of mid-Wales would be 100 miles from the new town which he had in mind? South Cardiganshire is only 56 miles from Swansea—does that help their problem of depopulation? Aberyron is suffering from depopulation, but does the fact that Swansea is 60 miles away help them? If we put a new town on the Border of Wales and England—and I am not condemning the project as such—it would help the immediate locality, it might help an area of 30 or 40 miles away, but to suggest that it would contribute substantially to solving the overall depopulation problem is incorrect. In fact, if it were not accompanied by a really substantial strengthening of the economy of existing townships it would worsen the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I welcome what the Secretary of State has said—that the question of the location of this new town, particularly from the point of view of men and industry, is to be examined very carefully. I hope that when the matter comes to be examined the overall needs of mid-Wales, and the overall needs of Wales as a nation, will not be lost sight of. There are difficult balances involved. It is no good trying to start a new town if it is not going to succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even in Aberystwyth. I accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, but I should have thought that we would have heard from him, since he is now talking of a new town, how it came about that he put a proposal to the nation for a new town of 250,000 people at Aberystwyth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has happened to date is this.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
spoken today to take the remotest interest in anything Welsh. That is a plain fact. This panel has put forward material for consideration, which I hope will in fact be considered with all other available material. When the location of the new town comes to be considered one of the factors to be borne in mind is the contribution it is going to make to stopping rural depopulation overall, and not simply in the immediate locality where it exists. It is essential to have a new town, but far more than has been envisaged today should be done to strengthen the economy of our existing townships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee knows that I am, by habit, a short speaker, and I am only rising at this hour because either I or the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State, who will, I gather, be replying, may well be interrupted by a vote downstairs, which may take 10 minutes away from our speeches. I propose to put to the hon. Gentleman the Minister of State three clear questions, to which I hope he will give a clear answer for the benefit of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by saying that nobody in this Committee for one moment questions the passionate and sincere desire of the Secretary of State to help Wales as a whole; we do not question his purpose. But I believe that I could sustain the view that his statement today was nothing but a smokescreen to conceal a complete absence of policy. In setting out my questions to the Minister of State I hope that I shall make abundantly clear my reasons for saying this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is about the new town. We all know what has happened. The Secretary of State, in the euphoria of this great moment in his career in achieving what has been his and his Party's ambition for many years, the creation of a Secretaryship of State, announced on Day One of his office that a new town would be created in mid-Wales. He gave a categoric commitment for the Government. We are sure that his colleagues in the Cabinet are as fond of the right hon. Gentleman as we are and that they all wanted to help him when he made this embarrassing commitment. The right hon. Gentleman was able to wring out of his colleagues just enough to enable him to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
make the procrastinating and evasive statement which we have had from him today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the whole question of whether or not to have a new town, and where to have it, is a question of jobs. There is a limited volume of mobile employment, be it industrial employment, commercial, academic or research employment. Competing for this limited volume of mobile employment are the areas of unemployment in Scotland, in Northern Ireland, on the Mersey, in the North-East and in areas of Wales. We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Box), in his excellent speech, how thinly spread and fluctuating is the volume of actual unemployment in mid-Wales. This is the heart of the problem. People who want jobs have moved away, and as the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) has just reminded us, the dispersion of the unemployed in mid-Wales is geographically very considerable. The hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) in his powerful speech said that it would be a delight for the badly-housed citizens of Birmingham to find themselves housed in a Welsh new town an absolute delight and an improvement to their life beyond measure. But, in view of the limited volume of mobile employment, can we hear from the Minister of State just what priority the Government have authorised the Secretary of State to give to a new town, or a group of expansions, justifying the use of new town machinery in or for the benefit of mid-Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution for mid-Wales must serve a national plan. That is why the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs has been appointed to his great office: to reconcile the needs of the different parts of Britain to the needs of the country as a whole. It is merely to obscure the issue that the right hon. Gentleman introduces the argument that, of course, he does not necessarily mean a new town; he might only decide to use new town machinery. New town machinery, is really only relevant if a relatively large settlement is built on a green field, or even a relatively large expansion of an existing settlement is decided upon. If these is a relatively large growth, then new town machinery could be justified, even if that growth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
were in several areas. One could justify a new town corporation to handle the expansion of two or three or four separate towns if in aggregate the expansion were sizeable. But if expansion is to be sizeable, then there will be a sizeable call on the pool of limited jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Secretary of State authorised to pre-empt for mid-Wales a relatively large call on the limited volume of mobile jobs which over the country as a whole must serve Scotland, the North-East, Mersey-side, Northern Ireland, as well as depopulated areas such as mid-Wales? The size of settlement and growth is absolutely crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We, for our part, support the idea of expansion of existing settlements. We do not question that a machinery of the same type as new town machinery might be one of the ways to achieve this, but we question whether the right hon. Gentleman helps the problem if he confuses the issue by talking about a new town, when all he has at the back of his mind is the use of new town type of machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my first question 10 the Minister of State is, what priority has a new town in the national plan which his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs has in preparation? Have the Government as a whole agreed that there should be a new town or a group of town expansions operated by new town machinery for mid-Wales? Has that decision been made or has it not? Yes or No, is what the Committee and Wales want to know from the Minister of State. If so, what priority has this particular project in relation to the priorities for Scotland, Northern Ireland, Merseyside and the North-East?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my second question. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Cardigan has reminded the Committee of what was said from this very place by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Watkins). The hon. Gentleman, by his position, is now prevented from replying for himself, but since he spoke from this position as the official spokesman for the Labour Party in July, 1964, I assume that the Minister of State will be able to reply for him. The hon. Gentleman for Brecon and Radnor on 15th July, 1964, said that he was making a clear statement concern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
ing the Labour Party policy in mid-Wales, said that the area of mid-Wales would have to be scheduled as a development district and depopulation would have to be regarded in the same category as unemployment. Are we to take it from this that the Government have gone back on that pledge, or are they telling us that they are giving depopulation, as it occurs in Wales, exactly the same treatment and priority as actual unemployment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When they were in Opposition the Government Members thought that the problem of handling depopulation was relatively easy. They condemned my party for failing to solve it. I hope that they are now recognising that it is not quite so easy. They authorised the hon. Gentleman the Member for Brecon and Radnor to make that categoric commitment, and we want to know whether mid-Wales is to be scheduled as a development area, whether parts of it are to be so scheduled, or whether the commitment has gone with the wind once the election is over and won.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to the third, and if it is any relief to the Minister of State, a much easier question. His right hon. Friend spoke of wider scope for the Rural Industries Loan Board. What exactly did the right hon. Gentleman mean? We know of its valuable work, and we should like to know what he has in mind on the wider scope. What sort of wider scope? What does that mean? What is the change in policy authorised for the Rural Industries Loan Board? Will it need more money? Will there be a question of extra legislation? Perhaps the Minister of State can fill out the details of "wider scope".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since it is the duty of the Opposition to make its points clear as well as to ask questions, I might state that we believe the right policy is the expansion of existing towns. This happens to be the view of some, if not all, the Members who sit for mid-Wales constituencies. We do not question that there may be a use for some machinery of the new town type in securing this. We welcome the extra help which the Development Commission, according to the Secretary of State, has undertaken to give to mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want from the Minister of State, and what mid-Wales will want, is clear, unambiguous answers to the three questions I have put to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a constructive and helpful debate, and the contributions have been marked by great thought from all Members who have taken part and the criticisms which have been made have been couched in reasonable terms. The debate has, I think, revealed a considerable degree of agreement about some of the methods proposed by my right hon. Friend in attacking this long-standing problem of depopulation and decline of mid-Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree on the need to encourage the basic industries, and although this has been said over and over again, nevertheless an old principle can be sustained by new measures. Among the new measures which will sustain the chief basic industry in mid-Wales must be the current farm Price Review and the proposals relating to it. If any Price Review was helpful to the small farmer this must be the most useful to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one reads the Welsh newspapers, with the greatest respect, one finds that that is hardly the view which is taken there. In talking with the Welsh farmers I do not think they would say what the hon. Gentleman is saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I talk to Welsh farmers, I am sure, quite as often as the hon. Gentleman. Mid-Wales is milk, sheep and cattle country, and surely the proposals in the current Price Review, which include a modest but helpful increase in the price of milk, and which has shown milk production is on the upturn in the area, and the extension to the small farmers' scheme are invaluable aids to precisely this type of area and farmer. The new scheme will bring in at least 2,000 more of the kind of farmers we want to help to remain viable in this area. The improvement of the hill sheep and cow subsidy schemes, the introduction of a flat rate subsidy for each eligible ewe in place of the old system of an average of 9s. 6d. for the past five years, must help precisely this kind of farmer in this kind of area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are certainly complaining about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not complaining to the extent the hon. Member would like to think they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are calling for the resignation of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The farmers have studied these proposals and there will be an amazing turn about in their attitude, once they understand what the proposals are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forestry also can make and has made a contribution. I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) that, taken singly, these proposals will not solve all the problems, but they are contributions. There is the proposed doubling of the contribution of the kind of factory which is appropriate to the small towns which are to be strengthened. This is not the kind of industry which will have to be introduced for a larger town or a large urban centre. We are talking of strengthening the outlying small towns, and the Development Commission has an important rôle to play here. The hon. and learned Gentleman made the point that 200 extra jobs per annum would not make any contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 100 extra.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, 200 in the future would not make a contribution to a problem in which, as he said, 700 agricultural people were leaving the area. The position is this, and I quote from his own source. The Mid-Wales Brochure, on page 8, says this:
	<br><q><p>"Through depopulation there are 700 fewer people in mid-Wales every year."</p></q>
So that it would be 200 new jobs against a loss of 700 people at present. If the number of jobs is multiplied by two or three times as many people depending on the employed worker it goes some way towards supporting the claim that this single proposal will help to staunch the bleeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody pretends that agriculture, forestry, or even a revived tourism using the water and scenic wealth of this area, extending the season by creating new forms of accommodation, directed to appeal to the weekender who is growing in importance in this country, and to attract the family holiday maker—that any one proposal singly will solve the problem. The hon. Member is making heavy weather by picking up each one and proving that that alone could not solve the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
We have agreed that basic industries must be strengthened. We have begun to do that through the Price Review. We have agreed that tourism and forestry could be strengthened, and we have agreed to do that in the only way possible, that is, by making available suitable land to the Forestry Commission. Perhaps the current review of common land in mid-Wales will show that there may be increasingly available in the next five years land for afforestation without infringing on land which ought to be used for agricultural production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also agreed on strengthening the existing towns. Hon. Members have asked, "What about services?" I particularly liked the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams) to the effect that if one is going to strengthen existing towns not only is it necessary to attract appropriate industry, it is also necessary to build up the services and particularly housing. Housing and communications are the key to the movement of industry in any part of the country, and particularly in this part of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it in the mind of the Government to give additional help for housing in these towns there? I know that at the moment when there is a proposal for a factory it is very difficult to obtain housing for key workers. There is the clash of interests of those who live in the towns to be rehoused and of key workers who come in from outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local government finance and housing finance are being actively considered at the moment. I can tell the hon. and learned Member that the question of encouraging and enabling local authorities to house key workers in order to attract industry is very much in the forefront in the consideration of housing policy. I would not like to go beyond that in a debate of this kind, but I do not think that will be an inhibiting factor in attracting industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the three questions which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) put to me. First, what is the priority the Government has given for the new town? I think he was chancing his arm a bit by putting the question in that form, but I will reply in this way. As soon as the consultant's report is received—and there perhaps will be two reports, one related
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
to location and site, and the other related to industry and population—there will be no delay in considering it in the Welsh Office and with the other Departments concerned, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Unless there are unforeseen difficulties—and this is fair to say—there will be no delay in starting to build.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is certainly answering me four-square. Will he go on to tell us what relationship this has with the timing of developments in the North-East Mersey-side, Scotland, Birmingham? Does this mean that, relatively, their chance of getting employment is going to diminish, and that a chain of further new towns shown to be necessary by new regional plans will have to take a lesser priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee and the right hon. Gentleman will feel I have already answered this question. As soon as the consultant's reports are received they will be immediately considered with the Departments, and unless there are unforeseen difficulties there will be no delay in starting to build.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question, "Is the Secretary of State authorised to pre-empt for mid-Wales a relatively large number of jobs?" is putting it a little high. These are questions which assume everything. I would answer in this way. Nobody is authorised to pre-empt any number of jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I.D.C.s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for argument, negotiation and agreement with other Government Departments, so that Board of Trade policy, by agreement in the Government, permits the build up of industry in some part of the country or another. This is attained by proving one's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the answer I have given to the first question it must follow that there will be for any new settlement in Wales the adequate and appropriate provision of the industry that is needed to sustain that development. That is the right answer to that, I think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question was about the area of mid-Wales, should it not be scheduled, and the right hon. Gentleman went back to what we said before the election about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
the need to schedule the area. Of course, the question of scheduling mid-Wales under the machinery of the 1960 and 1962 Acts was very actively canvassed before and since the election, I may say. The main consideration is that the present provisions expire in a year. They must be revised or replaced in a relatively short time. Therefore, the position of areas like mid-Wales, which have proved difficult to tackle under the existing Statutes, is now very much part of the consideration of what the new development district policy and development district regulations of Statutes should be. That is the right way to look at the areas which are left out of the existing regulations for development. In a few short months I expect that we shall be producing a completely new statement on development district policy. I listened with great interest to what the hon. Member for Swansea, West said on this point and equally to what the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan said. Mid-Wales certainly will be considered in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth question was about the Rural Industries Loan Fund. This was asked as a question for information. I must ask the right hon. Gentleman to allow us to await the decision of the Development Commissioners who handle the two loans funds which we have in mind, the workshop fund and the equipment fund, as well as the actual loan funds to small industries, because at the moment the Development Commission is in touch with the relevant Departments to work out the details in this matter. Possibly at an early opportunity in the House these details can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to another point, the area of agreement ceases on the question of a new town. The Liberal Party and this side of the Committe are agreed that this shall be a new town. Between us there is only the difference of location and site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And, if I may say so, preparation. In the Liberal plan, there is a first phase for development of the existing economy, of strengthening the town and setting up the communications. Once it has been decided where communications are going to be one can consider the best site for the town from the point of view of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is common to any plan for any new town or any settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Party plan is two-phased. There are really three-phases—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir K. Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say two-phased or two-faced? 	<i>[Laughter.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Tories are two-faced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand why hon. Members are amused. There are three phases to the policy in this matter. The difference is on location and size. I shall leave out the Conservative Party, which is not in favour of a new town in Wales. It has decided, finally and firmly today, and it should go out to Wales and mid-Wales, that it is not for a new town in Wales. It is in favour of a string of towns on the English side of the Border which will be open armed to welcome a continual flow of people from Wales across the Border. But the Conservative Party is in favour of nothing in Wales to catch the outflow of young Welsh blood from Wales. It is against it. This must go out to Wales, and it will give its answer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is now giving flight to fancy. Does he not realise that the youth of Wales can be caught far better in medium-sized, invigorated towns than in one large Welsh town?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member really ought to have listened. He would have heard my right hon. Friend explicitly say that, in addition to the creation of a much-needed modern urban centre of some size in mid-Wales, he was also intending to strengthen a large number of existing towns in mid-Wales. The instrument of doing it, with which, I think, the hon. Member would agree, is the Development Commission, a strengthened Development Commission, which would be able to do more than it does now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The differences between us and the Liberal Party, which, I imagine, now has the support of the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower), are these. We are in favour of a new town somewhere in the middle of Wales, not necessarily too large a town. The Liberal Party is in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
favour of a metropolis of a quarter of a million people on the west coast, and another large town of about 55,000 people—again I think in phase three—in the middle of the area. It is in favour of two vast new towns plus the strengthening of existing towns. If that goes through, in the future there might be a case for an overspill programme from Wales to Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not wish to pick holes in any proposals which have been put forward. I do agree with what the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan, to whom I always listen with great respect, although he hits hard quite often, said about the absolute importance of communications. He asked whether we would seriously consider communications as an urgent matter in these preparations. Of course we shall. Partly as a result of work which has already been done, the entire question of Welsh communications has been remitted to the Welsh Planning Board. This Board was built on what the right hon. Gentleman started himself as Minister for Welsh affairs. It is already at work on this matter which will include consideration of the necessary communications to revive mid-Wales as well as other parts of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I think there are ten minutes in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought it could be taken for granted that consultants would consult with every person concerned, including the Planning Board, about this aspect of development. I can tell him about the Planning Board is considering all communications throughout Wales. Mid-Wales has its problem, but not in isolation from the rest of Wales. Other parts of Wales, including the vast conurbation of south-east Wales, have problems demanding to be solved, and in tackling mid-Wales we must always have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
regard to the fact that communications run throughout the country, and, indeed, out of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) indicating that he sets the east-west communication far ahead in priority to the north-south communication. That is a point of view. One is seized of the economical importance of the east-west communications. One must always remember in Wales that our history—and, indeed, much of our weakness—has been fostered by the absence of a proper communication between north and south. This is as much a psychological as an economic question and I hope that the Committee will bear with us if—while we fully agree that the outlets for our manufacturers must be from west to east—as Welshmen we give the due priority to linking all parts of Wales together to give our people and children a new sense of unity and of purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the final point. I was rather disappointed that the Liberal Party did not argue, however briefly—I know the hon. and learned Member did not get a chance—the case for new machinery. The hon. and learned Member for Cardigan protested that there was no proposal for new machinery but did not deploy his argument for the new kind of machinery he wanted. There may be an argument for a paid board which takes up some of the functions of local authorities and others. All we know is that when it was proposed a few years ago it was shouted down by the local authorities, including those in Cardigan and Montgomeryshire. We prefer to make use of proven instruments of efficiency. The Mid-Wales Industrial De velopment Association, with its excellent office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hooson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must not misrepresent us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member really must let me go on. The mid-Wales Association, with its excellent officers and representatives, has a coherence of structure. It draws its members from the five county councils. If the hon. and learned Member will not decry its success he must not make too much noise about its powers. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. It has been successful with limited resources. I am not objecting against what was done. I think
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1964-1965V005P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
it was an excellent thing that was started in the last few years. With limited resources it has been peculiarly successful in presenting the image of mid-Wales as an area of opportunity to many industrialists who have come in and who have almost invariably made a success of their venture. We propose not to disturb and certainly. not to replace an instrument which has proved itself in this way. Possibly we shall look ahead to see whether this Association may not, with increased resources, increase its powers. Do not let us rush our fences on this matter. Let us see how the present Association with greater resources faces the quite new situation which the proposals made by my right hon. Friend places before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be other debates about this. My right hon. Friend will be consulting the Association. He will be coming to the House and certainly to this Committee as his proposals mature, asking for the comment and criticism of the Members of the House. He will also be discussing matters continuously as he is now doing with local authorities and others in the area concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What he has done today, after great thought and considerable consultation locally, is to propound a wise and sound five-point policy to begin to tackle this long-standing malaise in the heart of Wales. This is an unsensational approach to the problem. Mid-Wales cannot exist on a diet of reports or headlines. These are practical proposals. Nobody should decry them as including old ideas. Some of them are old ideas and are none the worse for that, if into
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
old ideas new spirit and determination are infused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might sum up, we shall strengthen the basic industries. There are great possibilities for tourism, forestry and agriculture. We shall strengthen the existing towns, using increasingly the Development Commission for this purpose. We shall set up a new urban centre, whether in green fields or elsewhere, on the best advice that is procurable. We shall expand and strengthen the existing loans and grants provisions to the Rural Industries Bureau and related bodies. Finally, but not least in importance, we shall give priority to consideration of communications in this area and how they can be improved, so that the necessary influx of industry and of population is made possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I notice that only one Member representing mid-Wales has been called this morning. We have had the views of Swansea and Hereford and we have had half an hour's interesting speech from the .hon.
