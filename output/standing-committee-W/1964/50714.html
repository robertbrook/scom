	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Iron Ore Ports and Industrial Development in Wales and Monmouthshire.—[Mr. James Griffiths.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate is largely to be about the important problem of the iron ore ports in South Wales, a matter which closely affects the future economic prosperity of what I believe is the largest industry in Wales today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not often that one must strike a discordant note in this Committee, but I would like to place on record the disappointment of my hon. Friends and myself that it has not been possible, in spite of requests, for a transport Minister to be here on behalf of the Government. I say that without disrespect to the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Wales or his hon. Friends, but it is, unless the constitutional position has been changed overnight, and unless the constitutional powers of the Secretary of State have been greatly increased—and we have not yet been told that the right hon. Gentleman is responsible for ports or transport of this sort—disappointing that a transport Minister is not here. Why is a transport Minister not available to speak in this debate? If there is a very simple and happy answer I will quickly give way so that the right hon. Gentleman may explain the position. If there is no reason, then I must emphasise and place on record the fact that is is a great pity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. James Griffiths)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to intervene, I will. We are discussing the iron ore ports, and pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
sumably we are discussing the subject on the basis of the White Paper which was published by the Government and in which they set out their decisions. That White Paper was presented jointly by my colleagues the Minister of Power and the Minister of Transport and myself as Secretary of State for Wales. Because of its special Welsh connotation and since it was a jointly presented White Paper—and since we are discussing the matter here and not on the Floor of the House—I thought it appropriate that I should take part in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his contribution. I repeat again that while I do not in any way derogate his position or his obvious interest in the matter, I must emphasise that he is not responsible for ports and that it is a great pity that a transport Minister is not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderic Bowen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member not welcome the extension of the interest and responsibility of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another question which, no doubt, the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) will, if he is lucky enough to catch your eye, Lady Megan, develop with his usual quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject we are discussing today—the question of the location and concentration of industry in Wales, with special reference to the ports—could never have been so well advanced had it not been for the steps which were taken in past years. As I see it, South Wales lies at the point of a triangle with London and Birmingham as the other points. When a Conservative Government took over in 1951 there was not the slightest vestige of a blueprint for the communications which now exist. The Severn Bridge, in all its magnitude, the motorways, so soon to be finished, and the other developments are a lasting tribute to the fact that a Conservative Government understood the essential importance of communications to South Wales and saw not only that they were blueprinted but that they were carried ahead with such impetus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a day or two ago we saw yet another section of this communications
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
triangle put out to tender; the section between Wyebridge, Monmouth, and Mitchel Troy. The contract was awarded to the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company and was for more than £2 million. I therefore say that the size of this transport concept linking South Wales so firmly with London and Birmingham provides a foundation for future industrial success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State wrote a very good article in "The Voice of Welsh Industry." Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman is becoming a voluminous contributor to the national newspapers. He wrote another extremely good article in the Western Mail the other day. I like his style. Whether or not he likes it, in his articles he indirectly pays great tribute to what has been done in Wales over the years—and I mean over the years during which we were happy and honoured to be the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his article in "The Voice of Welsh Industry" the right hon. Gentleman paid tribute to the amount of money which the Board of Trade had brought in assistance to Wales from the start of the Local Employment Act in 1960 to the end of 1964—more than £9 million. The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that one had only to look around to see clearly that industrialists had great faith in the future of Wales. I am glad that he paid that tribute to the solid foundation made for the industrial fabric of Wales during 13 years of Conservative rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, the road communications—planned and carried out by Conservative Administrations—prove a lasting testimony to the determination of Conservatives to bring prosperity to Wales. I only hope that the party opposite ensures that that trend is continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four years ago, in the debate on 14th April, 1961, referring to the changes in employment since 1925, the present Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So we see Llanwern and we rejoice; we see Margam and we rejoice still more; we see Trostre and we rejoice still more again, and all the other industries in the valleys."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th April, 1961, Vol. 638, C 727.]</p></blockquote>
Would it be too much to ask him to add today, "After 13 years of Tory rule we see South Wales and we rejoice"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the iron ore ports today we realise that the National Ports Coun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
cil was asked by the present Government to make a report on them. The Council did that in January of this year. The White Paper which the Government have produced quite rightly puts forward the alternative schemes which have been considered—Milford Haven, Port Talbot, Bristol Deeps and Cardiff—with two separate schemes for each, making a total of eight. The protagonists for the various alternatives of siting, depth of water and weather have all been put forward by the steel companies themselves. Indeed, this subject was not totally absent from the election addresses of certain well known politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concluding paragraph of the White Paper does not seem very definite. It comes down in favour of the two independent schemes for Port Talbot and Bristol Deeps and says, in paragraph 48:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After considering all the factors set out above the Government has come to the conclusion that the balance of advantage lies with a decision to proceed with the two independent terminals."</p></blockquote>
The phrase "the balance of advantage" is not very definite speech in Government parlance and the Government appear to tread delicately, like Agag. Although they seem to favour these two plans on operational and technical grounds, they do not say definitely that they intend to go ahead with them. It would appear that the matter is still open to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were two articles in The Times on 8th July which seemed to cast some doubt on the Bristol Deeps project, and a short letter in The Times this morning was headed "Another look needed". I do not intend to condemn the project in such strong terms as The Times article because, clearly, this is a matter into which much thought and research has been put. However, would the Secretary of State tell us whether the various factors which, through lack of space in the White Paper, have obviously not been able to be included—for example, the problems of the objections of the English side of the Bristol Channel—have been considered? What about the views of the Somerset people? What type of construction is envisaged? We know that the Bristol Deeps jetty will come within about 1,600 yards of the English border because of the size of the Channel and the site. What is to be the type of construction, and is it envisaged that shipping in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
Bristol Channel will be interfered with? One imagines all the problems of tide, climate and fog—and such things are never absent when considering shipping problems—and these problems must obviously be considered. Will the right hon. Gentleman also tell us whether, on both the Bristol Deeps and the Port Talbot schemes, it is planned that there should be some diversification of cargoes, because clearly this would lead to much more economical management?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much discussed question is that of the size of ships. Those who brought forward their schemes to the National Ports Council were told to provide those schemes on the basis that ships should be up to 65,000 tons. It is difficult to be right, at any moment of time, on this issue. Indeed, I remember so well, only seven or eight years ago, hearing in the House of Commons certain things about atomic research which were afterwards proved to be entirely wrong. I remember people talking about what the size of oil tankers would be. They were proved afterwards to have been entirely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Secretary of State give the reasons why it is thought that 65,000 tons is the right figure? Why have the Government and their advisers considered that the schemes should be planned on that figure? After all, if one considers the figures one finds that by 1970 of the ports which are at present providing us with iron ore—Sweden, South America and others throughout the world—only about one third of them will be capable of taking a 65,000 ton ship into harbour before sending the ore to us. On the other hand, and also looking to 1970—and the few years will go quickly enough—we know that certain ports, in Australia in particular—a most important area for long-term consideration—will be able to accommodate ships of over 100,000 tons. Ships of that size will operate at very low cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that when discussing this question of the iron ore ports there is only one thing that matters to the steel industry, and that is that iron ore should be brought to the hoppers at the back of the blast furnaces at the lowest possible price. That is something which, whatever our knowledge or inter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
est—and I have no personal interest to disclose—must be carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also remember that there are certain new scientific industrial performances, one of which is described as pelletisation. I have not seen this going on, but in certain producing countries crude iron ore is being rendered richer and comes here with a far higher percentage of iron content than in the original ore. It is of interest that the quality has gone up over the years. In 1956 there was an average iron content of 56 per cent. and in 1964 that had risen to 59 per cent. and it is likely to grow again. This is a factor on the other side and almost questions whether we shall always be taking ships of the very largest size and whether it is not possible that this is such a complicated business that we might well need both kinds of ships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not laid down their policy very definitely. We wish to give them plenty of elbow room. We do not underestimate the difficulty of coming to a decision of such great importance to the steel industry and to Welsh industry as a whole. There are many problems about the Bristol Channel and the future of the ports there which there is not time for me to discuss this morning. However, I hope that when the Government make their decision they will be able to give us a little more evidence to chew on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of such importance that it should be debated on the Floor of the House. We have been promised by the Government that it is to be debated on the Floor of the House, but we have not yet been promised that we shall have a day before the House rises for the summer Recess. I ask the Secretary of State, as I asked the Leader of the House, whether he can give us any assurance that there will be a chance to debate Welsh affairs on the Floor of the House and whether he will agree that this is a matter of such importance that he should bring further evidence to be incorporated in a major debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper is not very definite on a number of subjects. It does not show us what the Government's intention is. We press them to give us more evidence, and, if possible, to tell us the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
way in which they intend to handle this extremely difficult matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have opened the debate with the humility of someone with no knowledge of the steel industry, but realising, as we all do, that its future, especially in Wales, is of the highest importance. We have to get as near to the right conclusion as possible, and there are many detailed considerations to think about. Will the Government tell us what is in their minds, because we consider that there is not sufficient in the White Paper to make a proper case for what they may intend to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Harold Finch)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) has concentrated on the South Wales ore ports. I fully recognise their importance. They are especially important to the steel industry and of great importance to the British economy generally. The establishment of ore ports at Port Talbot and Newport as suggested in the White Paper will have beneficial effects on the Welsh economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales is to wind up the debate and deal at some length with the issues which are raised. It is fitting that he should wind up the debate. After all, he is the Secretary of State and is in the Cabinet and is closely associated with the White Paper. He is the Minister responsible for economic planning in Wales, and it is, therefore, very important that he should be here today to take due note of all that is said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) has reminded us, there are Questions in the House about why the Secretary of State is not taking over this or that Department, asking for his powers to be widened. Today the hon. Member for Hereford somewhat twisted that approach. There is now a complaint that the Minister of Transport is not here. We do not need two Cabinet Ministers present. My right hon. Friend is quite capable of dealing with these matters. As I have said, he has a responsibility for sponsoring the White Paper. I hope that in these circumstances we shall not hear anything more about the Minister of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
Important as the ore ports are, the debate is also concerned with industrial development in Wales. The livelihood of our people and the prosperity of Wales largely depend on economic development. It is, therefore, fitting that I should refer to some of the features of that development which have occurred since we have been in office. There is no harm in spending a few minutes on the position in Wales and showing how we have made progress and how things stand in the present set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say at once, as we have been reminded, that industrialists have shown great interest in Welsh industry during the past six months. Investment in factory development has increased over the same period of last year. In that respect we are making progress. I am happy to note that industrialists are taking this keen interest. During the period 1st January to the middle of June, 28 firms not previously operating in Wales agreed either to build factories or to occupy factories already in existence, and 14 of those firms have chosen locations outside the industrial area of South Wales, thus contributing to the diversification of industry in the more rural areas. Furthermore, 50 firms already manufacturing in Wales intend to build entirely new factories in which to expand or extend existing factories by a total of more than 1 million square feet. Nine others plan to expand by acquiring space mainly on Government-owned industrial estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These 87 cases of new industrial gain or growth which have become known promise nearly 7,000 additional jobs, 4,600 of which will be for men. This compares very favourably with the 9,000 expected from a full year's development in 1964 and is equal to the employment which was expected from all developments in the whole of 1963.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However encouraging the figures for the first half of the year appear to be, we must not lose sight of the fact that, although the insured employee population of Wales in 1964 was the highest ever, at 991,000, the figure hides the situation that since 1954 the male employee population has not grown at all. In 1954 it was 684,000 and it remained at about that figure in 1964. So we are not catching up. Developments have, there-

	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
fore, done no more than maintain the opportunities of employment for men at the 1954 level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the Committee will appreciate that the Government cannot in eight months deal with the legacy of the past years but they are conscious that the number of jobs for men must be increased substantially. We went through the period of the 1930's with its stagnation and decay and we have not got over that. The problems which face us today are the problems of growth, problems resulting from automation and mechanisation. We are going into the computer age. All this is creating new problems, but they are not the problems of the 1930's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware of the Report of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire on the employment of disabled persons. Much has already been done, and today there are fewer than 4,400 unemployed disabled people in Wales, whereas in June, 1950, there were nearly 11,000. We are making progress. Remploy, the D.R.O.s of the Ministry of Labour and the disablement advisory Committees and the employers have all done and are continuing to do their parts. Under the 3 per cent. quota arrangements, better employment prospects for all automatically mean better prospects for the disabled The further industrial developments, the new employers and the new factories, will take their 3 per cent. quotas, so that the more factories we have, the more of these disabled men will be employed, and already over the years the number of unemployed disabled workers has been reduced to 4,400.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Keith Joseph</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have the comparable figure for last year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have it to hand, but I believe that it was approximately the same. There has not been much change over last year, but the number of unemployed disabled workers has come down through the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the new gains which I mentioned earlier went into industrial South Wales, but I am happy to say that they were not confined to South Wales. They went to the North-East,
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
the North-West, Central Wales and Pembrokeshire, where they are so much needed and which have all shared in the advances. In each area the potential employment estimated by the firms concerned comfortably exceeds 200, and in the North-East of Wales the figure is 500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another indication of the improving economic health of the Principality is the rise in the demand for labour. The number of unfilled vacancies in June was 13,760, which was 20 per cent. more than in June, 1964, and an increase of 5,000 since the beginning of 1965. However, the Government are keenly aware of certain problems which will have to be faced for some time to come. For example, we must recognise the prospect of a continuing decline in the employment of men in coal mines and, to some extent, in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are witnessing great changes in the mining industry, changes which will create difficulties and which can be effectively overcome only by planning and co-operation among the Government, the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers. With that co-operation the industry can overcome its difficulties and become prosperous, even though it may contract, and still make a very effective contribution to the country's economy. Already my right hon. Friend the Minister of Power has announced the short-term aid measures which the Government propose for the coal industry, and, more recently, their intentions about the capital reconstruction of the industry. It is not yet known how these measures will affect the South Wales coalfields, which, we all recognise, give cause for concern in a number of ways, particularly in respect of output, profitability and the maintenance of an appropriate manpower force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the full measures to be taken by the Government in connection with the coal industry are known later this year, it will not be possible to say what will be their effects on the South Wales coalfields. However, together with his Cabinet colleagues, the Secretary of State will do everything possible, should it be necessary, because of the more rapid closure of uneconomic collieries, for example, to bring new industries to the area so as to maintain and, if possible, expand present levels of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my belief that any closures of uneconomic pits and the establishment of new industries must be properly phased and planned. As I have indicated, this can best be done by co-operation between the National Coal Board, the National Union of Mineworkers and the Government. The Government are prepared to discuss with the industry, the Coal Board and the N.U.M. a scheme to provide special funds to ease the disappearance of uneconomic pits. What has to be done will be done and managed with the best interests in mind of the men and the communities affected. The need is clearly seen for getting on at an ever increasing pace with the diversification and expansion of Welsh industry so that there will always be an attractive and fully adequate range of good jobs. I think that I can offer the fruits of the first six months of this year as some evidence of what can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties, too, in particular parts of Wales. Special attention is given to development districts. There has been, as hon. Members will know, a substantial extension of the list of districts eligible for the full range of financial inducements available under the Local Employment Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer to progress in some parts? In West South Wales there have been encouraging developments recently, the most significant of which was the acquisition of the Prestcold Factory by the Ford Motor Company. I am sure that this will have beneficial effects on the existing industries of the Swansea area through the possibility of sub-contracting opportunities, and it will certainly provide valuable educational opportunities for the young people of the Swansea district. Altogether the gains of the last six months in this area may yield about 2,750 additional jobs, mainly for men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Pembrokeshire a very welcome development has been the announcement by the Gulf Oil Company, which is to erect an oil refinery on the north side of Milford Haven, that its plans include the provision of the first petro-chemical plant to be built on the Haven. Although the resulting employment may not be large, this will be a valuable contribution and broadening of the district's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gains have been made in North West Wales, and I should like to mention
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
specifically that the needs of Anglesey are being carefully watched as the labour demands at Wylfa Power Station increase and eventually decline. There are developments at Bethesda and other parts of that locality. The peak of labour demand here will not be reached until the end of this year, but we must look well beyond that to the long-term requirements of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Favourable developments have also been announced in North East Wales, the total employment promised by them being, as I have said, about 500, some 200 of them for men. Here is an area where local concern about male employment is well known and where every attempt is being made to make the right provision for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Mid Wales, the position has been discussed fairly recently in this Committee, but I should mention the factory development taking place there. A small new factory is to be erected at Rhayader for a firm to make nuts and bolts and pressings. Two firms have arranged to take space at Llandrindod Wells and at Llangadog, and in all about 230 jobs are expected to result from developments during 1965. I am well aware that there is much disquiet caused by the decision to close the military camp near Towyn. The particular difficulties which arise are being considered in the context of the general policies for Mid Wales which have already been made known, and I am hopeful that there will be little or no hardship to the workers at the camp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As our industries develop in the different parts of Wales, it is important that we should make sure of the quality and quantity of training at all levels. There are many aspects of this subject, and there is not time to do justice to them all. I should, however, like to take the opportunity of paying tribute to the work of Government Training Centres. In Wales they are training about 800 people a year, and soon this number will be increased to about 1,000. The training boards have been established in Wales, so we look forward with some optimism to the further encouragement of training our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many firms are joining in the drive to extend Welsh skills. For example, in Newport and Bridgend, groups of firms
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
have already agreed to set up group training schemes, and there is hope of setting up further groups elsewhere. We must all recognise the need for greater skill and for its best and most efficient use. We must also recognise that we have to get ahead with technological development both in traditional industries and in the science-based industries. The rate at which industry develops technologically depends on the ability of the management to apply the results of research as quickly as possible. Management must be able to understand the implications of new developments such as computers and automation and must be able to exploit them quickly and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much is said about the need for more research, and certainly we have to ensure that our efforts keep us in the forefront of scientific and technological developments in our chosen fields. However, research is far from being the whole answer to our problems and there is much evidence to show the need for a quicker and wider application of the research information already available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progress is being made in the establishment of a network of industrial liaison officers by the Ministry of Technology based in colleges of technology throughout the United Kingdom. In Wales three officers are already being appointed, and two more will be in post in early 1966. I am hopeful that the efforts of these men will help to bring about a greater use of computers, automation and the financial and scientific facilities which are available from the National Research Development Corporation, the universities, Government laboratories and, of course, the Ministry of Technology itself. In some ways the number of computers in use in industry may be regarded as indicating the technological development of an area, and in this sense in Wales the picture is reasonably encouraging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Finch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knew when he intervened that this was part of the subject of the debate. He will hear a great deal about the ore ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the 44 computers which are either in use or on order, 21 are owned by private industry, and the others are used by local authorities, academic establishments and the nationalised industries; and most of these also make a significant industrial contribution. I have been able to see for myself recently how far the Welsh steel industry has advanced, using no fewer than 16 computers in its various undertakings. I have also been able to see in other enterprises how the use of sophisticated methods of management with and without these machines can be applied. Certainly we have something to be proud of in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it seems true to say, unfortunately, that in the medium-sized industrial firms the use of computers is not being developed as quickly as one might desire. One difficult problem in increasing the pace of technological development is the shortage of good technologists. This is a problem which is not peculiar to Wales, but it, nevertheless, appears to be particularly acute in the Principality, It is likely that stronger contact between industry and the universities may bring about a change in the supply and demand for technologists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of supreme importance for the future of industry that there should be liaison between our universities in Wales and industrialists. We have the research and the know-how. The liaison may be looked on as a long-term policy, but it is essential if we are to make industry as modern as we desire.

The Planning Board is bringing to a close its report on the South Wales industrial area. This may interest hon. Members opposite. It will be followed by one on North Wales. It is con-

currently preparing a special report on all aspects of communication in Wales at the Secretary of State's request. A project of great potential importance to North Wales is a barrage across the River Dee. A Technical Working Party under the chairmanship of the Senior Engineering Inspector of the Welsh Office is now preparing a report on the scope and cost of studies to be undertaken by the Hydraulic Research Station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from this current work, it is to be expected that, after the First Secretary of State has published his outline national plan in the autumn, both the Board and the Council presided over by my hon.

Will they go ahead on the basis of this White Paper, or will there be further discussion in the House?

The point that I wanted to put to the hon. Gentleman was that it is going to be very difficult for the rest of us if we have to wait until the Secretary of State winds up to hear an indication of the Government's views. This means that the perfectly legitimate debate on this subject chosen by the Opposition will be conducted completely blind, without any knowledge of the Government's views.

I conclude by saying that this is the time for a sober and realistic appraisal of our present condition and our objectives. It is in the strength of the well-laid long-term policy that we shall put our faith.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ifor Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Lady Megan, I should like to repeat what has already been said, that there was an agreement that the subject this morning was to be iron ore ports and industrial development.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Lady Megan. It is a fact that discussions have taken place upon this subject through the usual channels. It is also a fact, on the question of the subject we are discussing to-day, that the Government have never been in any doubt at all that the object of the debate was to discuss iron ore ports. We wished to do so six weeks ago, but we were perfectly happy to discuss agriculture to suit their convenience. There is no question of any hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to be examining the port facilities of Europort at Rotterdam this morning, but when this Committee was postponed I cancelled my visit to Europe for two reasons. The first was that I believed that Cardiff's claims were so vital that they had to be placed before this Committee, and, secondly, I realised that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan), and the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas), were both unable to speak during this Committee because of their Ministerial responsibilities. So to some extent I speak for the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman as well, though obviously they will violently disagree with some of my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will, I feel, thoroughly agree when I pay my tribute to the town clerk, the city treasurer and their advisers, Sir Bruce White & Partners, in their tremendous efforts to place a comprehensive and successful case for Cardiff before the National Ports Council. They will probably disagree when I say that the Government are treating Wales, and South Wales in particular, with utter contempt in refusing to send a representative of the Minister of Transport here
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
today. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport gave me an absolutely solemn undertaking in the House when I queried whether we were going to have a debate, on the Floor of the House, before the Government's decision was announced. In his rather pettish and arrogant manner he slapped the Despatch Box and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is the matter with the hon. Member? How many times do I have to say it? I have said it again tonight, it was said on 22nd December, it was said by my predecessors, we have said it repeatedly to hon. Members who have raised the matter, that the Council's recommendations will be debated in the House before any decision is taken. Now that I have said it so many times, perhaps hon. Members will accept it."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd February, 1965; Vol. 707, c. 182.]</p></blockquote>
Where do the Government stand on that solemn undertaking given by one of their Ministers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Government's failure to implement that promise, I think it is hardly surprising, though surely without precedent, that the Government's decision, as conveyed in the White Paper we are discussing today, should be so speedily rejected by one of the successful applicants, Richard Thomas and Baldwins, thus confirming in a dramatic manner many of the doubts and suspicions held by experts in this field. The White Paper compares the alternative schemes on a financial basis, and it concludes that none of the alternatives considered offers a decisive financial advantage. The choice, therefore, is made on a basis of operational planning, technical and other factors. It is obvious that at all stages this decision has been very finely balanced indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was against this background that the Government decided to allow the construction of two independent terminals, one at Port Talbot, and one at Llanwern, known as the Bristol Deeps Water Scheme. Although the Government seek to justify Port Talbot, I am afraid that they are unable completely to discuss the very obvious misgivings they have about it, because paragraph 32 of the White Paper mentions that substantial dredging is required. It also mentions the problems which an open harbour, exposed to the rough seas, will involve. First of all, there is dredging. The cost of constructive dredging exceeds £3 million, and that has presumably been
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
allowed for in the estimates considered. It is doubtful whether sufficient allowance has been made for maintenance dredging, which I understand could amount to as much as £½ million a year. All calculations so far have been based on a model with a solid sea floor, which completely ignores the fact that Port Talbot is very close to the Briton Ferry Dock, and that dock was quickly and completely silted up when the dock gates were removed a few years ago. Until an engineering solution is found, by using a loose sea bed model for these studies the economic viability of Port Talbot must remain in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, secondly, the question of rough sea conditions. The claim in the White Paper is that delays with the new harbour would be no greater than with the one already in use. To my mind that is utterly unrealistic. The existing docks are impounded, a dock gate is closed, enclosing the ship when unloading is in progress. In contrast, a new harbour would be fully exposed to the rough seas of the Atlantic, to an extent that ships may have to put out to sea for safety. We must not forget we are talking in terms of 65,000 "tonners", not the 10,000 "tonners" at present in use. The other independent operation, known as the Bristol Deeps Scheme, relates to Richard Thomas and Baldwins at Llanwern. Richard Thomas and Baldwins promoted this scheme and resisted any alternative until recently. Now it seems to be losing its enthusiasm very rapidly indeed. Instead it is taking an interest in alternative facilities at Newport Docks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons submitted for abandoning this scheme is the death of the most powerful backer of the Bristol Deeps Scheme, Sir Henry Spencer, former managing director of Richard Thomas and Baldwins. Sir Henry Spencer died twelve months ago, and the Ministry of Transport gave permission for the expenditure of £90,000 on dredging the basin at Newport last November. Why was Richard Thomas and Baldwins's changed decision not announced before the issue of this White Paper? Were the Government so heavily committed to this White Paper that it came too late, or did they decide not to alter their decision? What guarantee is there that there will not be further changes of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
management involving fresh schemes. De-nationalisation is a very real possibility, now that the Government have abandoned steel nationalisation. Is Richard Thomas and Baldwins to be allowed to proceed on the basis of an admitted gamble by the British Railways Docks Board? I think that the Committee is entitled to an answer to these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast to all these doubts and uncertainties connected with Port Talbot and the Bristol Deeps Scheme at Llanwern, I want to turn now to the only serious alternative, the conversion of Cardiff into an iron ore common terminal. The Government's reasons for selecting the independent terminals in preference to a common terminal are outlined in paragraph 20 of the White Paper. They say that there would be less handling of the ore and less possibility of disruption. They talk in terms of labour troubles, accidents or weather. Thirdly, they mention stability of costs. Here they fear that rail haulage and hauling costs may increase over the years. I would like to deal with these three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is obvious that a common terminal involves extra handling, but, to my mind, this is compensated for by the lower initial capital cost and the increased revenue for the railways—it must be remembered there are four-line rail tracks to both works from Cardiff. Also, there is the need for extra employment, particularly as the more unprofitable mines of Wales are closed. The Under-Secretary outlined and highlighted this in his speech, and it is a very real fear for the future. We might need these extra jobs in Wales in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the disruption fear because of labour troubles, accidents and weather could apply to either scheme, and, therefore, the objections under this heading cancel themselves out. On the question of stability of costs, the chief question is the ability of British Railways to stabilise their road haulage costs between a common terminal and the steel works. I understand British Railways communicated with the National Ports Council by letter on 15th June, 1964, making an offer covering a period of at least 15 years. Surely the Government are not casting doubt on the ability
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
of British Railways to keep a solemn contract if they enter into one? They have the track, they can provide the wagons and all they need is the freight. We must not overlook the fact they already carry 2½ million tons of iron ore a year. There seems to be no reason whatever why they could not carry the remainder if asked to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 30 of the White Paper claims that the scheme submitted on behalf of Cardiff, jointly with British Railways Docks Board has under-estimated the total cost. Yet the Government or the N.P.C. refuse to substantiate that claim, although the total cost is still under half the total cost of the two terminal schemes. The difference is quite substantial. The National Ports Council says that Cardiff's scheme will cost £15.3 million, including contingencies, while Cardiff says that its scheme will cost £11 million excluding contingencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Ports Council has, therefore, added £4.3 million, or 40 per cent., extra for contingencies, and the experts advising the Cardiff City Council in the matter rightly claim that that figure is unreasonably high and quite out of proportion for what is considered to be a normal, straightforward harbour improvement. Yet, in the same Appendix 2, and without any explanation, the figure for the Llanwern and Bristol Deeps Scheme—based on the sworn evidence of Mr. W. F. Gilbertson, of Messrs. Richard Thomas and Baldwins—has been reduced from £17½ million exclusive to no less than £14¼ million inclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be seen that the Board and its advisers have reduced this figure, sworn to by Mr. Gilbertson, by over £3¼ million. I ask why. Is it feasible that Cardiff's and Messrs. Richard Thomas and Baldwins's figures could be so wide of the mark? Should they be accepted without any covering explanation? In my opinion they should be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 30 also says that the Board would be unable to show that the improved facilities would attract substantial extra traffic to Cardiff. Of one thing I am absolutely sure; the Board would have no difficulty whatsoever in showing that Cardiff is already operating at a loss, which will be considerably increased
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
when Guest Keen Iron and Steel removes elsewhere the one million tons of iron ore imports which it at present brings into Cardiff docks—and it has already indicated that this would be inevitable if the terminal schemes were adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this happened, half the trade of Cardiff Docks would disappear overnight, and with it would go the plans for a kingsized dry docks, which would be the only one between Liverpool and Southampton. There should not be any doubt in anyone's mind that this White Paper, if accepted, means the death sentence for Cardiff Docks. The coal trade has already gone to Barry, the iron ore would go either to the Bristol Deeps at Newport or to Port Talbot, and the general cargo would be shared between Barry on the one hand and Portbury, which is rapidly coming nearer as the Severn Bridge is completed, on the other. This would be quickly followed by the oil trade, because both jetties can carry oil, and surely ship repairing would also follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being a defeatist about this; I am just facing the facts. It is no use the Government or anyone else offering platitudes about further talks with the B.T.C. about alternatives. We have been over that before on many occasions. The Plain truth is that if the decisions of the White Paper are accepted we may just as well start dismantling the equipment, scrapping the railway lines and filling in the docks in Cardiff, and turning them into a good factory site. That would be a very sad day for the dock workers, the pilots, the tally clerks, the ship repairers, the shipping agents, the ship storemen, and many others connected with the docks. It would be a sad day for Cardiff, and a sad day for Wales. The Secretary of State for Wales would not be able to escape his share of responsibility as a signatory to the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, concerning the doubts about the viability of the Port Talbot scheme; the doubts stimulated by Richard Thomas and Baldwins's late change of mind; the doubts associated with the unexplained figures in the report, and the doubts about the future of so many workers in Cardiff, I hope that the Government will have the courage to have another look at the White Paper.
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
In the words of The Times leader to which my hon. Friend has already referred:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Has the idea of a single common terminal been given a fair hearing?"</p></blockquote>
In my opinion it has not. Should the Government commission an independent engineering study into the whole system? I claim that they should, and I hope that the Committee will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on which I have sought to address the Welsh Grand Committee. On that account I do not propose to ask for any indulgence—and after the speech to which we have just listened I do not intend to strain myself too much in according indulgence. However, I speak in this Committee with some diffidence, because one of the discoveries that I have made since I have had the honour to represent a Welsh constituency is that political discussion in Wales is conducted at a more sophisticated level than in the rest of the country. People in Wales manage to combine logic, subtlety, emotion and poetry in a style which those of us who have only a trace of Anglo-Saxon blood—and that is all that I can confess to—cannot emulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are naturally diffident in those circumstances. However, I wish to participate in the debate partly because of the particular interest which my constituency has in the matter under discussion and partly because it is important for the whole future of Wales. The hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Box) said that the Government had treated the members of the Committee with utter contempt because they had not made arrangements for a representative from the Ministry of Transport to take part in the debate. If hon. Members opposite were so insistent that the debate must be dominated by the Ministry of Transport, one would have thought that they would have invited their own shadow spokesman for transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member says "power". He might have thought of that before he intervened earlier, because there was a representative from the Ministry of Power here earlier, who would have been quite capable of dealing with the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the insult which the hon. Member has just offered to me. The reason why we have asked for the presence of a representative from the Ministry of Transport, and the reason for our disappointment that he is not here, is that a good deal of the White Paper depends on the judgment of the Minister and his Department, and he should be here to explain matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is all that the hon. Member has to say, I would point out that I heard his colleague say exactly the same thing before. He received the answer that the Secretary of State for Wales was going to deal with these matters. I was merely underlining the fact that if hon. Members opposite go to the length of saying that it is treating the Committee with utter contempt not to have a representative from the Ministry of Transport here, they might be expected to have invited their own spokesman in transport matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No—the hon. Member has had a fair go, and has said that the Government have treated the Committee with utter contempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain that? The reason why I referred to the treatment of this Committee by the Government was that the Minister of Transport was intimately involved in all the negotiations leading up to the publication of the White Paper. That, surely is a valid reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the same statement that we have had before. We have been given the reply that the Secretary of State will deal with these matters. Hon. Members opposite do not like being replied to in their own kind. If they had wanted to emphasise that point they could have invited their own shadow Minister of Transport. Presumably he has studied all these iron ore matters—or is not he interested in these ports? Is the hon. Member who speaks for the Conservative Party on these matters so uninterested in these ports that he has not bothered to examine the White Paper? We understand that he has even some remote connections with Wales. He might have been invited to come here, but all we have as a substitute for him is this hotch-potch miscellany of hon.

Members who hold various posts in the Shadow Cabinet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Members almost unending spate of rudeness, but as an Opposition we are entitled to have an opportunity of understanding the Government's proposals, and without the Minister of Transport's presence that is hardly possible. I accept that the hon. Member believes that attack is the best form of defence, but his discourtesy fails to disguise the ineffectiveness, weakness and discourtesy of the Government in putting forward their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is not the Shadow Minister of Transport. Hon. Members opposite accuse the Government of utter contempt for the Committee, and if anyone tries to defend the Government they get on their dignity. I do not know what the hon. Member is here to represent. We are not quite sure what he is the shadow for. He also said that this was an improper way to deal with the debate. The Government have presented a White Paper in which they have stated their case in respect of the matter in hand, and that is a very proper way of giving advance information to the whole Committee, so that the matter can be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry for the way in which my speech is developing. I had proposed to start in a much milder tone. Nobody could object to the manner in which the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) began the debate. He obviously did not know much about the subject, and was wise enough not to pretend he did. But the hon. Member for Cardiff, North approached the matter in a very different manner. It is natural that anybody who represents Cardiff should put forward the interests of Cardiff, but it should be recognised that all the information that he has given to the Committee was presented to the National Ports Council. All the evidence that he has presented, as if it were something original and he was an expert on it, could quite easily have been presented to the Council, and I have not the slightest doubt that it was. We are not sure what the hon. Member for Yeovil is doing here. In any case he might have taken the precaution, before coming here, of reading the speech made on behalf of the previous

	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
Government by Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett, now no longer in the House, who was in the Government when this matter came before the House on 22nd June, 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case was then presented for a common terminal, instead of an independent terminal system, and Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett, speaking for the Government, properly said that it would be quite possible for Cardiff and all the other interested parties to present their cases to the National Ports Council. It is true that the evidence from Cardiff came later than the other evidence, but it was quite possible that this "dark horse" would be able to win the race. More than that, the Government put at the disposal of Cardiff and all those interested in the matter special facilities to enable them to carry out investigations so that the evidence presented to the Council should be of the most comprehensive nature. That was more than a year ago. It is no good hon. Members saying that Cardiff has not had a fair chance to put its case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must realise that there was a variation of about 40 per cent. in the figures submitted on behalf of the Government and Richard Thomas and Baldwins. They have been altered without any explanation whatever. Is that fair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is further evidence of the care with which the Council examined the figures. Some of them required further examination by the Council in order to see that they were correct. The hon. Member cannot put forward the argument that the Council did not investigate the figures carefully, because what happened was that the Council investigated the figures with such care that it found defects in them. The argument which the hon. Member is putting forward is on my side and not on his. However he tries to drag in technicalities, it is clear that all the evidence that he has presented this morning was presented to the Council, and it came to this conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it is a difficult decision. That is one reason why we do not have to pay much attention to the technical knowledge of the hon. Member for Cardiff, North. He may be a great
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
expert in matters of mining and so on, but when it comes to steel and ports I see no reason for our having to regard him as an authority. As I say, all the evidence he presented today has been examined by the National Ports Council, which made up its mind and recommended the proposals which are before us. As the hon. Member for Hereford rightly said, there is indeed a narrow balance of advantage. That is why there is such difficulty in reaching a conclusion on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was wrong for the hon. Member for Cardiff, North, in presenting his case on behalf of his constituents, or some of them, to misrepresent the position of other people, which is what he did in regard to the case presented by Richard Thomas and Baldwins. The hon. Gentleman said that it was unique, strange or extraordinary that one of the favoured parties should have rejected the finding. It is not the case that Richard Thomas and Baldwins rejected the finding. He also said that Richard Thomas and Baldwins had made a changed decision. That is not the case, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time as Richard Thomas and Baldwins was promoting a Bill through the House of Commons to enable it to carry out the Bristol Deeps scheme, if that were approved, it was also carrying out other investigations. The firm investigated the possibility of the jetty scheme in the Bristol Deeps in the interests of the nation at considerable cost, on the invitation and with the encouragement of the former Government, who encouraged Richard Thomas and Baldwins to go ahead with the Bill which has been presented to Parliament; and it went through when this Government was in power. It is no good anyone criticising Richard Thomas and Baldwins for going ahead with that scheme, because the firm was directly encouraged to do so. It was rightly encouraged because the Government said, as the present Government have said, "It is better for you to have this Bill on the Statute Book so that there will be no delay if the decision is made in your favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many representations have been made in the House and elsewhere to the effect that it might not be the best scheme or that there might be alternatives. One of the alternatives was put forward in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
our earlier debates—partially by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Newport (Sir F. Soskice), who is now the Home Secretary. He said that there might possibly be dredging operations to be carried out in the mouth of the Usk River, which might provide an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), who has a constituency interest in the matter, has pleaded that there should be the fullest examination given to every other alternative scheme. Thus, what Richard Thomas and Baldwins has done is to carry out alternative investigations, partly at its own considerable cost and partly at the expense of the Government, to ensure that whether or not there is an alternative—now that it is conceivable that there will be an alternative which does not involve possible amenity difficulties—there will be an alternative which provides an independent terminal for Llanwern and the rest of Richard Thomas and Baldwins' steel works. If that proves feasible, it will be the alternative to the Bristol Deeps scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is harsh that while in the House of Commons many pleadings are made for investigations to be continued to ensure that all alternatives are not wantonly rejected, when this firm conducts those investigations it is told that it has changed its mind and has not decided to do what it said it had intended to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attack of the hon. Member for Cardiff, North on this matter shows the same kind of despicable political prejudice which we expect from him—the same way as he misrepresented the figures of Welsh mining, and the same way as he criticised the appointment of a most distinguished citizen of Wales to become the Chairman of the Welsh Hospital Board. The action of the hon. Member for Cardiff, North when Sir Archie Lush, a distinguished constituent of mine, was appointed to that position was to put down a Question criticising the appointment. Then the hon. Gentleman did not have the courage to turn up to press his Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not pursue that matter, because, although this a wide
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
debate, I do not think that it includes the hospital service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely trying, Lady Megan, to offer further evidence of how little reliance we should place on any representations made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North. I appreciate, however, that that point was rather superfluous. But I was complaining at the fact that the hon. Gentleman first of all misrepresented what Richard Thomas and Baldwins had done in the matter since the White Paper was presented to the House and then proceeded to misrepresent what the firm had done throughout the previous months. He talked about the possibility of going ahead with the firm's gamble when, in fact, if eventually a decision is arrived at to go ahead with the jetty scheme in the Bristol Deeps the matter will have been examined in the utmost detail and with the greatest care. It was, therefore, most improper for the hon. Gentleman to have dismissed this as a gamble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a privilege to be abused by the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot). It means that there must be something in my case. If I have misrepresented the position, then half the newspapers in the country have done the same. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the very full article which appeared in The Times on 8th July and which dealt with the subject in some detail. Did he not read it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I read it. It is perfectly true that the hon. Gentleman did misrepresent what was the situation of Richard Thomas and Baldwins. He said that there was a changed decision. He talked as if Richard Thomas and Baldwins had abandoned the whole of the jetty scheme. That is absolutely incorrect. What has been happening is that the firm has conducted an alternative investigation to see if it proves successful and feasible and will be advantageous in many other respects. That was a perfectly proper course for the firm to take, and all the abuse heaped on it by the hon. Gentleman was quite out of place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter is that there is, as all hon. Members should recognise—and this was admitted by the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
Member for Hereford—a balance of advantage and disadvantage in all these schemes. It is foolish for anybody to be absolutely dogmatic about one scheme being obviously superior to another. All the technical points raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North have been examined, as well as the other questions about the size of ships and so on. There are countervailing arguments on all these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger, therefore, which faces the country and Wales in this respect is that, because the balance of advantage and disadvantage is so narrow, nothing may be done—that the decision may be held up for many further months or even years. The danger is that we shall be in the position of Buridan's ass. Buridan said that if his ass was placed equidistant between two stacks of hay it would not know which stack to go for and might starve to death. If the balance was absolutely equal in both directions, that is the danger in which we might find ourselves. The Government have made up their mind to go ahead with two independent terminals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But have they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and it is useless for hon. Gentlemen opposite to say that there are not extremely powerful technical arguments in favour of such independent terminals. They are set out in the White Paper, briefly but powerfully, in paragraphs 20 to 23. Those paragraphs say not merely that the National Ports Council has accepted the superior arguments for establishing independent terminals but that the Iron and Steel Board has arrived at the same conclusion. The remarks of Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett in the debate in June, 1964 set out in simple and plain terms what are the obvious advantages of independent iron ore terminals. Such terminals have been accepted by most other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the time had come when the Government had to make up their mind on the matter if we are to modernise the country and if Wales is to have all the possibilities of expansion. If we are to have real modernisation, someone had to make up his mind, and that is precisely what the Government have done. Now the Opposition are squealing because the Government have taken decisions instead
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
of postponing important decisions which must be taken in the interests of Wales and the country as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the Government were firmly coming down with a decision on this subject. Would he please read the conclusion in paragraph 48 of the White Paper? Would he not agree that the wording of those three lines is far from definite, and that, far from coming to a definite decision, the Government are rather like the animal to which the hon. Gentleman referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have stated in that paragraph that they admit that there is a difficult choice to be made. That is the meaning of the words "the balance of advantage". They say that that balance of advantage comes down in favour of two independent terminals. That is the decision of the Government, and I very much hope that they will stick to it, because it is a decision which I regard as being in the long-term interests of not merely the iron and steel industry of Wales but of the people of Wales and of the expansion of industry there generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear at the outset that—and I am sure that in this I speak for a great number of my hon. Friends—we are delighted to have the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Wales with us today. I say that lest he may have misunderstood some of the remarks which were made earlier. We are delighted to have him here and we know his deep interest in this and other matters affecting Wales. We are, likewise, delighted to have the Under-Secretary with us. He knows that I have the highest respect for his work. I hope, therefore, that he will not take it amiss if I, too, repeat the criticism which was made earlier and say that we should have liked to have seen a representative of the Ministry of Transport in the Committee because this is a matter which has primarily involved that Ministry and this is a decision with which it has been closely connected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch) was no doubt technically accurate in his interesting and important account of Welsh industry, he should appreciate that in the context of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
debate his speech, hastily delivered, threatened to create a shambles of our discussion—preventing it from being the coherent discussion of an important topic in which we could express our knowledge, questions and fears. The fact that he had to hop from one part of Wales to another, so to speak, without having time to develop his arguments showed how ill-advised he was to have made that kind of speech in this debate. This question of the iron ore ports is indeed a vital topic on which we can have a well-informed and useful discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the documentary evidence before the Committee is, to say the least, somewhat inadequate. The report of the National Ports Council to the Minister of Transport, or at least some fuller information about the nature of that Report, should have been presented to us. Meanwhile, we have the White Paper, Cmd. 2706, which is inevitably full of generalisations, and, I fear, in some cases full of over-simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering an extremely important decision which will have far-reaching and long-term effects which will not be easily reversed or even modified. Thus, if there is any possibility of serious error it would surely be better for the Government to decide to reconsider the whole matter in the light of the criticisms which are being put forward by people who are not without detailed knowledge of these important matters. I recognise, as the White Paper emphasises, that the choice of a terminal or terminals is vital for the effectiveness, efficiency and competitiveness of the steel industry in particular and British industry in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This choice is likewise of tremendous concern to the Bristol Channel ports of South Wales. I know that the Secretary of State will not think that our concern, or that of those whom we represent, is unreasonable. After all, most of our South Wales ports have had particular problems and difficulties during the last twenty years or so. At Milford Haven, for example, there is a feeling that oil forms too large a proportion of the traffic of that port. The docks at Barry, Cardiff and Swansea have severely suffered from the post-war decline in coal shipments, and at Barry and Cardiff we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
struggled with the difficult job of trying to build up general cargo traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first main basis of the choice would appear to depend on the comparative merits of a common ore terminal or two independent terminals. Paragraph 48 of the White Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After considering all the factors set out above the Government has come to the conclusion that the balance of advantage lies with a decision to proceed with the two independent terminals."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Secretary of State will assure the Committee that the Government have considered all the vital factors, as the paragraph says. I would like him to reiterate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 20–23 of the White Paper detail many of the advantages of two independent terminals. Developments in European countries and Japan and the United States are emphasised, and we asked to believe that they are good examples for us to follow, and there may be much substance in that point of view. The probability of cost escalation through rail haulage and double handling is mentioned as an objection to a common terminal, and again it would appear, superficially at least, that there may be much substance in that point of view. Emphasis is given to the advantage in two independent terminals of having all the operations under the control and supervision of the steel works management. To those who are not experts in these matters, this would seem to be a strong argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, so far as one can see from an examination of the White Paper, less consideration appears to have been given to the possible advantages of a single terminal of considerable size, able to accommodate the very largest ships. In this I am not making any special plea for any particular port, because at this stage Milford as well as Cardiff could have a claim. In this connection, will the right hon. Gentleman comment in greater detail on the letter in The Times a few days ago by the Chairman of the Cardiff Chamber of Commerce, who expressed the view that less attention appeared to have been given to the possible advantages of a single terminal than to the comparative advantages of two independent terminals? Can the right hon. Gentleman give us more information about the greater capital cost of two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
independent terminals and how that may be compensated for by economies in running costs over the years, and will he explain the basis of his calculations? He will note that the table at the bottom of page 5 of the Report combines capital and operating costs. I am advised that the absolute validity of the assumed operational costs is open to question, and I should like some reassurance about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph 47 of the White Paper the point is made that the adoption of any scheme other than the two schemes at Llanwern and Port Talbot would mean up to a year's delay through the necessity to obtain statutory powers. The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) probably had this in mind when he spoke about possible delay. This, again, would appear to be a valid, and even formidable, consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But over-emphasis on this point would seem to be at some variance with the assurance given during the passage of two Private Bills. I recall to the Committee that during the passage of certainly one of them, if not both, we were assured that alternative schemes would in no way be prejudiced by the passing of those Bills. It now appears from the argument in the White Paper that any alternative scheme would be prejudiced by the fact that those Bills were passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend also agree that the Welsh Shipping Agency Act provides for tests to take place in the regime of the Bristol Channel and that that would almost certainly take considerable time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the case. The point I want to make strongly to the right hon. Gentleman is that we were given the assurance that alternative schemes would not be prejudiced by the readiness or willingness of Parliament to pass those Private Bills, and yet the White Paper now makes the point that the need for further legislation for an alternative scheme is itself a barrier to an alternative scheme, and that is strictly at variance with that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Secretary of State to assure the Committee that if these massive projects at Llanwern and Port Talbot are proceeded with, the Government will pay particular attention to the other
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
needs, the general cargo needs, of the docks at Barry and Cardiff and Swansea, because this massive capital investment at Llanwern and Port Talbot must not lead to a deprivation of capital for necessary modernisation at Swansea, Cardiff and Barry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Barry, by self-help and with the praiseworthy efforts of the council and many local interests and industrialists, we have succeeded in bringing considerable general cargo to the port. There may be errors in decisions of this kind. Only a few years ago, the Rochdale Committee was seriously in error in its assessment of the future of the port at Barry. Today, Barry has a port which is earning a considerable surplus for the Docks Board. It is one of the Board's most useful assets. Yet, according to the Rochdale Committee, its usefulness was past and its possible closure ought to have been contemplated. If such a serious error can be made once, it can be made again. I hope that the Secretary of State will take the view that, although there may be a need not to waste time and for there to be no unnecessary delay, a wrong decision now would be worse than a correct decision in a few months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let every possible consideration be given to these countervailing arguments. These are weighty matters. The amount of money, capital, labour and building materials involved is enormous. Once taken, the decision could not easily be changed or modified in any way, and it could have far-reaching consequences for the whole of the area. I therefore hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give us some of these necessary assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) when he spoke about incoherence. The incoherence of the Opposition this morning was born of the remembrance of their own shortcomings. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) said that in 1951 there was no blueprint for Wales. He forgot about the Distribution of Industry Act and the great happiness brought to Wales by a Labour Government. Certainly there was no blueprint in 1964 when the Tory Government left. On the morning of 12th March, 1964, the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K.

Joseph), then Minister of Housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh Affairs, was forced to say in an Adjournment debate that the then Government had no integrated plan for Wales but only segmented arrangements, that two plans would come in 1965, one for South Wales and one for Mid-Wales. They forgot that they were giving a blank contract form to the people of Wales and they failed to obtain acceptance in Wales. The people rejected them and the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams) emphasises that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite possible that the hon. Gentleman misheard what I said. What I said about 1951 was in connection with communications and motorways. All I said was that in 1951 when we came to office there were no blueprints whatever for the motorways. That is a fact, and that is all I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McBride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman also referred to industrial developments, and I am, therefore, entitled to those observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary correctly said that we must do more than maintain the situation and that we must provide for the future. I wish to consider the Welsh ports apart from the two ore ports. The use of spare capacity in the ports of South Wales is of great interest to the people of South Wales, and, for that matter, to the whole of Wales and Britain. The Welsh Council of Labour meeting at Porthcawl this year, speaking for Wales in the absence of any active Tory spokesman, said that this was a matter for serious debate, and it had in mind the improvement of communications with the resulting speedy delivery of manufactured goods for export and the import of raw materials. I recently suggested that a clearway from South Wales to the North-West of England would materially help in bringing goods to the ports from the hinterland and relieve congestion at the major ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I have an interest, but I am not chary of disclosing my interest, as hon. Members opposite are in some cases. I have the honour to represent part of Swansea, and the docks are
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
situated in my constituency. The desire to use the spare capacity of the Welsh ports was emphasised recently by the Industrial Association of Wales and Monmouthshire in a statement which it issued at Cardiff on 21st April. Curiously enough, this statement mentioned the polarisation of the Portbury scheme and referred to the fact that the Rochdale Report said that there were already too many ports in the Bristol Channel. The Portbury scheme, sponsored by the Port of Bristol, would mean in stage one development that there would be eight berths, two bulk cargo berths and six general cargo berths, and the dock would have to be dredged to accommodate vessels drawing up to 43 feet of water. At 1963 prices, the cost of the development would be £27 million, and, taken together with the interest payable during the construction period of five years, there would be another £10 million, making a total of £37 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment there is idle berth capacity in the South Wales ports capable of accommodating the largest type of general cargo vessels. A report in the South Wales Evening Post on Monday said that trade at Swansea Docks during the first half of the year had fallen by more than one-third compared with 1964. That report quoted British Transport Docks Board figures published the day before. If there is idle capacity at South Wales ports, development would result in additional berthage to accommodate the largest type of general cargo vessels. It has been estimated that within the existing docks 20 additional berths with a total lineal quayage of just over 15,000 feet could be provided at a cost of £17 million, and these additional facilities could be provided as required and without interfering with the existing trade in the docks. Stage one of the Portbury scheme would have to be constructed in its entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the unused capacity. At Swansea Docks yesterday only five ships were worked, giving work to 245 dockers, while 110 men were left at the call. I therefore hope that Swansea's traditional position in general cargo and coal handling work will be recognised and steps taken to increase the tonnage shipped, and that the importation of iron ore will not in any circumstances result in a decrease of shipments of tin plate from Swansea.

	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Report of the British Transport Docks Board, which published its accounts yesterday, said in paragraph 81 on page 26:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Long term plans for the South Wales Docks were prepared in conjunction with Port Consultative Committees and progress was made with the development of certain component schemes."</p></blockquote>
This seems to rule out iron ore development. It would be useful if my right hon. Friend could tell us of any plans which are under discussion in view of the potential of the South Wales ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The South Wales ports have a hinterland, an area of industrial development, the men to handle the work and the potential for the expansion of capacity. They are an integral part of the Welsh economy and can help very much in building up Britain's export trade. They are of importance to the people of Wales, to those who work in them and to the towns in which they are situated. They are the trading lungs of Wales and should be kept clean and healthy, because by the expansion of trade and the hope for continued expansion of that trade they breathe life into the towns and the nation. These ports should be used to the full and should be recognised as invaluable assets, which they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words about industrial development. The great need in South Wales is the introduction of self-generating growth industries. The day of the smaller, cottage type industry is over. We are looking for large integrations to provide work where contraction may take place by the march of automation in the steel and mining industries, and to provide opportunities for the young. I know the great satisfaction of my hon. Friends the Members for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams) and Neath (Mr. Coleman) about the coming of Fords. This is an example of self-generating industry, and great credit is due to my right hon. friend the Secretary of State and all concerned for the part that they played in introducing it. However, we are concerned with the march of automation, properly referred to by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State. If we increase the automatic manufacturing process, inevitably men will be displaced. It is no good discussing solutions when
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
the problems are acute. We must think about solutions in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no denying that industrial contraction will take place in the steel industry. My mining friends know full well that, with the introduction of remote-operated longwall mining, with the news that there is an automatic pit, and with the knowledge that soon there may be no miners in mining, alternative industry must be brought to the areas where mining is the only industry. While one can cocoon an industrial engineering building, one cannot do it with a mine. When the floor rises and the roof falls and the last safety man has gone, the pit is dead. Miners who have contributed so much and who work with danger as their constant companion have the right to know that they will have security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems are immense and we must have appropriate solutions. I think—and Wales will agree with me—that a Labour Government and a Labour Secretary of State will bring to the problem that conception of sympathetic understanding born of the fact that we are talking for the people we represent. The Labour Government represent the mass of the people with few exceptions, and I look forward to the day when my right hon. Friend brings in the regional plan for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a mere Englishman to visit the Welsh Grand Committee is a singular privilege. I think that most English Members fear being sent to the Scottish Grand Committee perhaps more than anything else in life. The rare occasion which gives the opportunity of a visit to this Committee is a great privilege. One recognises with great humility that this is the home of oratory and that one is among people who are great masters of the English language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the disappointment expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) at the absence of the Minister of Transport. I want to make it absolutely clear, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Mr. Gower), that this is no reflection on the Secretary of State, who—again I speak as a visitor—we are delighted to see. I understand why the Government should want to have him here. I am convinced that all his powerful and wonderful eloquence is needed to conceal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
the flabbiness and barrenness of this miserable White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pause to wonder what the Minister of Transport would have said in the old days. I had the privilege of sitting opposite to him when he was shadow Minister of Power, and I know how good he was at indignation. Had this kind of proposal been put forward then without a word from the Department responsible, the Minister of Transport would have been furious and would have smothered us with eloquence, and poor efforts such as the ones I am making would not have been anything like adequate to stem the tide of rage and indignation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say how much I associate myself with what my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford said about the Conservative Government's achievements in Wales, and particularly in South Wales. My very humble duties in the last Administration took me down to Wales on a number of occasions. I do not think that anyone can deny the immense progress which was made there during our years of office. I believe that my hon. Friend was right to remind the Committee of what had been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point which I echo and to which I shall return is the reason for the limit of 65,000 tons. I say to the Secretary of State without wishing to affront him that it has been very hard for the Opposition to conduct this debate in a sensible manner without having had an explanation of the Government's view of these proposals. We have been greatly embarrassed by the lack of an explanation. I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State did not wish to cripple this debate from the start, but, nevertheless, the fact that he did not refer to the Government's views on the ore ports put the Opposition at a very unfair disadvantage and almost nullified the effect of the choice of subject which they made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State referred to the progress being made in Wales. He said that there had been no increase in employment opportunities in the last ten years. He might well have referred to the figures which show the increase in output and earnings which took place over that period. They would have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
very significant. If the Secretary of State has them, I hope that he will give them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to take up at great length what the Under-Secretary of State said because he did not mention the subject in which I am most interested. This is not a party point, but I wonder how useful it is for Ministers or Members of Parliament to give industrialists lectures about the usefulness of computers. When we can put our hands on our hearts and say that we know something about these highly complicated and mysterious techniques, then we shall be qualified to talk to industrialists about them. But until we are masters of them we should be careful about the advice which we give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Box) made a perfectly reasonable speech. I cannot understand why (he hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), who is such a fierce defender of the interests of his own constituents, should find it so odd and exceptionable that someone else whose political views he does not share should seek to do exactly the same thing. My hon. Friend made a very reasonable, calm and perfectly legitimate statement of the case which can be made for Cardiff. Other hon. Members, not on the same side of the Committee as my hon. Friend share and must be identified with many of his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly made the point that there is a need for detailed engineering studies of these proposals. These are not party matters. If they become party matters, we shall be pathetically the victims of the party charade which we play too often. This issue basically is of immense importance to the development and modernisation of the whole country. The decision which is made will be of great importance to Wales and to the steel industry of the whole country, and we must be careful that we do not haphazardly make the wrong decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was not unfair in the points to which he drew attention, particularly those about Port Talbot, Llanwern and Cardiff. I am sorry that no one has said much about Milford Haven, which has a great future in the economic and industrial history of these islands and which few, except the oil companies, have yet acknowledged.

	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale started his speech, quite rightly no doubt, by applauding the people of Wales for their sophisticated level of political discussion. He went on to accord to me a welcome which contained all the cordiality and courtesy of which he felt capable, and for that I am very much obliged. I am a beginner where he is concerned in the art of showering his political opponents with contempt. I have heard him on occasions when he has been most impressive, but his speech today for most of the time was concerned simply with heaving a load of muck on my hon. Friend and his passionate belief that attack is always the best form of defence. It made no useful contribution to the solution of an immensely important problem.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention does not surprise me. He fails to appreciate the difficulty, which I referred to at the beginning of my remarks, that the Opposition labours under, not having had the privilege of hearing the Government's views on iron ore ports. This is a very grave embarrassment to us. It was only towards the end of his speech that the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale really admitted, or made mention of the fact, that there are in this choice of ports, immense countervailing arguments. I am the first to appreciate that anyone who seeks to overlook the close balance of arguments
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
here is wrong. I am very sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not address himself more to those arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Foot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman now admits that openly, why does he rebuke me for having condemned the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Box), for describing one of the schemes, which had been very carefully examined and to which great attention has been paid, as a "gamble" and as "a scheme to be dismissed." That is the scheme for Bristol Deeps. I said that it was very difficult to choose from all the schemes, but that the Government had to choose in the end. Why does not the hon. Gentleman deal with that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale thinks he can make the kind of speech which he made this morning without anyone passing comment on it he is wrong. One point upon which we would like to have light shed is what are the intentions and present views of Richard Thomas and Baldwins on this matter? Does it wish to go ahead with the jetty scheme, because the suggestion has been given very wide currency that it is no longer interested in this scheme. In passing, I would like to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), has been unsuccessfully trying to catch your eye, Lady Megan, in order to express his constituents' views and anxieties on this subject. I come from South Somerset, so I hope that I shall be acquitted of expressing any constituency interest. There is an immense amenity issue here and this great jetty is going to be like a long dirty and noisy snook cocked at North Somerset. It is going to be a source of great distress to the people living there. I wonder whether, in the close balanced arguments prevailing in the choice of ports, enough weight has been given to this aspect. What bothers me is what has happened so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this document is all that the National Ports Council produced, then I am tempted to express the opinion that the Council is something of a disappointment, and I put that as quite a mild expression of opinion. It would appear that the Council simply wrote round to the various people interested and asked what sort of proposals they had to make.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
I do not believe that in doing that it ensured that full weight was given to the claims, not of the people of Milford Haven, but of the port committees, and the great facilities which are there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to criticize or comment in detail upon the scheme put forward by the Port of Cardiff. No doubt it knows its business a good deal better than I do. What I am concerned about is to know whether there has been adequate judgment on the merits not of the schemes put forward but of the ports themselves. I think that this should take place before any final decision is made. I echo the views expressed in the extremely trenchant leader in The Times, of 8th July to which reference has already been made. I think it was a perfectly fair and well-deserved comment on what I believe is a very weak and flabby White Paper. This is not a party point, because I have a nasty feeling that had the Conservative Party been in power this White Paper might still have appeared. Nevertheless, it is here, and it is the right hon. Gentlemen opposite who are responsible for it. It is a very nasty, weak and inconclusive report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one or two references to illustrate this. In paragraph 13 it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In doing so, they recognised that they could only make a general appreciation, since the technical aspects in particular were formidably complex; but they were satisfied that further investigation would not materially add to the information available nor influence their recommendation."</p></blockquote>
How on earth did they come to that conclusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 15 revives the point about the maximum weight on the size of ships. What real grounds are there for believing that 65,000 tons is the desirable maximum? Experts have been wrong in the past and doubtless will be again. The comment has been made that inadequate thought has been given to the idea of a common terminal or independent terminals, and I must say this is my impression reading the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 19 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This leads to the general conclusion that, because of the lack of any positive indication that any one scheme offers decisive financial advantages over all the others, great weight must be given to operational, planning, technical and other factors in reaching a decision."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
What does this mean? I think I was wrong in saying just now that such a White Paper would possibly have slipped out under a Conservative Government. It was my natural generosity running away. I believe that this White Paper and the flabby, almost apologetic conclusion give one no confidence at all that the matter has been sufficiently investigated. I say to the Under-Secretary of State that he would command our respect, or add to the respect in which we already hold him, if he were to get up and say that the Government are going to have another look at this and reconsider these arguments, and are not going to commit themselves to schemes of which they themselves seem to be unsure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 46 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government will sympathetically consider what more can be done towards meeting the amenity points then put forward."</p></blockquote>
When one hears that the Government will "consider" anything, one knows that hope must almost inevitably be at a very low level indeed. I earnestly hope that this matter, which is of immense importance, will receive further consideration, and that the House of Commons and Parliament will be given some evidence of the seriousness which the Government attach to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is the Welsh Grand Committee, the subject has been chosen and read out, and we have discussed it, and the Under-Secretary has, I feel, given the Committee a good survey of the progress made in Wales. If the Opposition think that this matter ought to be discussed in some context other than the Welsh Grand Committee, why do they not choose it as one of their subjects for a debate on Supply?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very important project that we are discussing today began when the Steel Company of Wales and Richard Thomas and Baldwins came to the conclusion that one of the vital necessities for ensuring their continued success was to make sure that iron ore imports were brought into their works efficiently and more cheaply. They gave consideration to this problem and put forward proposals which were submitted, first of all, to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite when they were in power. Both companies came to the conclusion that the most efficient way of meeting this need to reduce costs of imports was by building terminals to serve each of the companies separately. I can quite understand their decision. This is a highly competitive industry. The Steel Company of Wales, like all other steel companies, is very important to our export economy. South Wales produces all the tin plate produced in this country. One-third of it is exported. Therefore, the cost of the steel which eventually goes as cold-rolled to the other works and is made into tin plate is vitally important to the export trade. I do not profess to be an expert on the steel industry, although I have lived with it and near it all my life, but this is the pattern taking place in other countries. This is exactly what our competitors are doing in Europe. In Dunkirk, the nearest competitor, in Taranto and in Genoa, new strip mills are being put up. The arrangements for importing iron ore are exactly as Richard Thomas and Baldwins and the Steel Company of Wales want in South Wales. This is what their competitors do. It is what has been done in the United States of America. It has serious consequences for Wales. These modern steel works are being built on the coast near to ports in order that they may be able to import iron ore cheaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two companies came to the conclusion that by using independent terminals, able to take ships of a certain size, to which I will come later, they would be able to reduce the cost of the iron
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
ore at the works by 10s. a ton, which eventually becomes a reduction of 25s. In a country like ours, where industrial prosperity is so important, where the export trade is life and death, the fact that independent terminals bringing ore in suitable ships into the works produces a saving of 10s. a ton on imported ore and 25s. a ton on finished steel is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is: by what method? In a sense, it has been a choice of two alternatives. It has been a question of independent terminals for each company, or a common terminal. Two proposals have been put forward from Cardiff for a common terminal, and two from Milford Haven. In addition, consideration was given to the question whether one of the two independent terminals could become a common terminal. The evidence seemed to suggest that if we came to a decision in favour of a common terminal it would be not at Milford Haven or at Cardiff, but at Port Talbot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Government considered it, the matter was thoroughly examined in other ways. Let me tell the Committee about the journey of this matter to this Committee. It did not start here, and perhaps it will not end here. Perhaps the hon. Member for Cardiff, North
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
(Mr. Box) will take it to the Floor of the House. The proposal for two independent terminals was put forward by the two very big and experienced companies—companies with great technical experience and advice. I do not always agree with the steel owners. Sometimes I quarrel with them. But I pay tribute to the way in which these two great works have been established. I also pay tribute to my fellow Welshmen who work in them, and to the way in which they have learnt new skills and crafts, to make these two great integrated plants the success that they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for two independent terminals were supported by the Iron and Steel Board. They have been examined by the National Ports Council. It came down in favour of two independent terminals. All the schemes have been examined by the Government Departments concerned, and they have come to the same conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important regional considerations are also involved in relation to the success of the steel companies and their location. These two plants were not just put down in a vacuum. They were built to replace the old industry which has traditionally been at home in Wales for one and a half centuries. In the evolution of this matter hundreds of small plants were closed and thousands of men at the age of 50 found that their skills and crafts were taken away by automation. That is the story of the location of these plants.

I was glad to hear the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot). Many people argued very strongly and voted against establishing works in Ebbw Vale. It was therefore right for me to take advantage of the opportunity to consult the Welsh Planning Council and ask it what were the regional advantages of the scheme, other things being equal. It came to the conclusion that regional advantages lay in having two independent terminals. The integrations of Margam in South-West Wales and Llanwern in South-East Wales were essential in order to provide a firm basis for future industrial development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peyton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman telling us that Richard Thomas and Baldwins is still 100 per cent. in favour of the jetty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment. Richard Thomas and Baldwins has intimated that it is now examining another scheme, called the Uskmouth scheme, as an alternative to the jetty scheme. Its examination is not yet complete. When it is, and it has made up its mind whether the Uskmouth scheme is a better alternative to the Bristol Deeps scheme, it will indicate its final view to the Government. Until it does that, no steps will be taken about the jetty scheme. Our basic decision is in favour of two independent terminals. Richard Thomas and Baldwins is having second thoughts, and I should have thought that the Opposition would welcome that. They have been asking for second thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Richard Thomas and Baldwins will eventually make up its mind—I hope it will not be too long—and submit its scheme to the Government. The Government will consider it, and come to a decision—but our decision in favour of two independent terminals is definite, and stands.

I now turn to the question of the size of ships. None of us would dare to speak with final authority about this. I rejoice in the fact that enormous natural advantages, both to Wales and to Milford Haven itself, have been discovered as a result of the depth of water available at Milford Haven. There are many attractions, for nostalgic as well as other reasons for the Milford Haven scheme, but the problem was: what is the effective size of ship for importing ore? A detailed study was made of the problem, because it concerns the efficient size of ships not only at Port Talbot and Llanwern but also at the places where the ore is loaded. This is not a matter that can be decided purely on the difference between Port Talbot, Newport and the Uskmouth jetty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detailed study led to the conclusion that the efficiency point was reached at 65,000 tons. The problem has been examined by very important people, including the Iron and Steel Research Association, which conducted the first survey. The results of that survey have been examined by others, and the conclusion has been arrived at that 65,000 tons is the efficiency point. That may change. Therefore, in considering the question, we have been careful, having come down in favour of two independent

terminals, to ask what would happen if the present effective size of ships at 65,000 tons changed, in X years, to 100,000 tons. After full consideration of this question it has been found that both schemes can cope with the problem of increasing the size of ships to 100,000 tons. We therefore have an insurance against changes of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has asked what is the Opposition's view on this. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Box) is a fair one.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the publication of the White Paper, Richard Thomas and Baldwins has indicated that it is thinking about another independent scheme. When it submits its alternative proposals to the Government, we will consider them and make up our minds. But we have already made up our minds about having two independent terminals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Box</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Would it be in order, Lady Megan, to suspend the Committee in order to invite the Minister of Transport to attend at another session, so that we may have an adequate reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That would not be in order, because the Minister of Transport is not a Member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not waste my time in replying to the jibe of the hon. Member for Cardiff, North. He is too busy going through the valleys collecting house coal everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the problems of Cardiff. Does the hon. Member for Cardiff, North suggest that I have no regard for Cardiff? Cardiff was built on coal. Cardiff Docks was built on coal. But I recognise that there are changing circumstances, in which the great system of docks in Cardiff, which was designed for coal exporting, will have to be adapted to other uses. We are concerned not only with these schemes but with the ports of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An examination is being made of the situation, and we shall publish the results. I hope that we shall be able to have a debate on them in this Committee. Meantime, I return to the problem of our two steel works, whose success is vital for the nation and vital for Wales. It is vitally important that they shall succeed, and that we shall have the benefit of all the considerations which are being given to the problem by all the bodies to which I have referred. We must also bear in mind regional considerations—the interests of South-West Wales and South-East Wales, which are clearly affected by changes in this industry. It is in the interests of us all that the decision of the Government to have two independent terminals shall be approved by this House and by the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
