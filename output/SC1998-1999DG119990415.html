	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 42) on the Promoting Independence: Partnership Grant for 1999–2000 (HC 301).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 43) on the Promoting Independence: Prevention Grant for 1999–2000 (HC 302), and the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 44) on the Promoting Independence: Carers Grant for 1999–2000 (HC 303).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the sound of the activities on both sides of the Committee, this is clearly going to be an enthusiastic and committed Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The total amount of grants that we are discussing today is £293 million. The partnership grant is worth £647 million over the next three years, of which £253 million will be spent in the current financial year, £216 million in 2000–01 and £178 million in 2001–02. That is all new, ring-fenced money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prevention grant totals £100 million over the next three years: £20 million this year, £30 million in 2000–01 and £50 million in 2001–02. That, too, is new, ring-fenced grant money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The carers grant totals £140 million over the next three years: £20 million in the current year, £50 million in 2000–01 and £70 million in 2001–02.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All three grants are financed from the new resources secured in the comprehensive spending review, details of which were announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last July. Social services was one of the areas that was given priority by the Government as a result of the comprehensive spending review. We increased the resources available to social services departments by 6.3 per cent. in 1999–2000. For the first time, we have guaranteed that national resources for social services will increase in real terms for each of the following two years, enabling social services departments to plan ahead in the knowledge that there will be increased funding. In fact, social services will receive almost £3 billion more in total over the next three years, which is an average of 3 per cent. more than inflation in each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The resources that we are making available for these grants are in addition to any resources that local authorities have received in previous years. They are the first social services grants to be made available in the new era of extra cash in return for outcomes. The grants are part of the new modernisation fund created for social services and will be used as a lever for modernisation throughout all adult social services. We are determined to ensure that they are used by local authorities to improve the services that they provide to the people in their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our guidance to local authorities about the grants states clearly that for planning purposes, authorities can assume that the allocation method for the grants in years two and three will be the same as for this first year. However, as with this year, the allocation of special grants to local authorities will ultimately depend on parliamentary approval in the year in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership grant is a key element in our strategy to develop partnership working between health and social services and to break down the "Berlin walls" between the national health service and local authorities, thus improving the services that individuals receive. Local authorities will be required to plan and to agree with their partner health authorities how the grant will be used to promote the independence of people requiring their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant represents a significant injection of new money into the system to ensure that the partnership agenda is properly delivered. However we want to ensure that the agenda becomes part of mainstream activity for local authorities and the national health service, so the amount of new money represented by the partnership grant reduces over the three years as the new ways of working become embedded in the culture of the new national health service and local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made clear our intention to promote partnership working between the national health service and local authorities on many occasions. The national priorities guidance, for example, set for the first time priorities for the health service and for social services. Crucially, we included joint priorities, including the "promoting independence" priority, and key shared objectives for both parties. The White Paper entitled "The new NHS: Modern, Dependable" made clear our intention to break down the "Berlin walls" between the health service and local authorities—the legal and financial barriers which, for far too long, have prevented agencies from working effectively together to provide the best service for individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We published in September last year our proposals for taking this forward in the discussion document "Partnership in Action". The proposals were universally welcomed. And in November, we published the social services White Paper which took forward this agenda, not least by announcing the new partnership and prevention grants that we are considering today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are not content with simply making policy statements. The challenge for all of us is to translate that policy into concrete benefits for our constituents. We are legislating for the proposals in "Partnership in Action" in the Health Bill, which had its Second Reading two days ago. As well as legislating for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the operational flexibilities proposed in "Partnership in Action", the Health Bill includes a new strengthened and broadened duty of co-operation for NHS bodies and local authorities. It also requires health authorities to draw up a strategy for improving health, involving all local partners, including voluntary organisations. We have consulted on new performance assessment frameworks for the NHS and for social services which, for the first time, will include joint outcome indicators for both those key partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are creating the structures to enable NHS bodies and local authorities to work better together; we are creating the means by which we can assess how effectively those incentives are being used to improve services; and, through the partnership grant, and the other two grants that we are considering today, we are providing the necessary resources to enable social services departments to enter into meaningful and beneficial relationships with their NHS partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aims of the partnership grant are to foster partnership working between health and social services in promoting the independence of adults needing community care services. That will help local authorities to achieve the objectives for adult services set out in the social services White Paper and in the objective on promoting independence in the national priorities guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key condition for the grant is that local authorities must draw up a plan in partnership with the health authorities in their area which sets out how the additional money will be used to meet these important objectives. The plan must include proposals in a number of key areas, such as joint assessment for individuals, joint procedures for hospital discharge and better rehabilitation and recuperation services. If social services and health authorities work together in those areas, we know that there are important benefits for individuals. People are helped to stay at home, rather than be admitted to hospital. They can be discharged from hospital to their own home rather than a residential or nursing home. Vulnerable people, in particular, are better able to receive services where and when they want them, because agencies are working together to meet the needs of the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for a joint plan goes with the grain of the developing partnership agenda. Health authorities and social service departments have already been working together to produce joint investment plans. They are setting out the resources that they intend to invest and how they propose to develop services for specific client groups. In the first year, such plans have been required only for services for older people, but many health and local authorities have used the opportunity to set out plans for the development of services at the interface for all client groups, not just older people. In these cases, there is already an established plan which can be used for setting out how the partnership grant will be used. Even where local partners have focused on older people in their joint investment plans, they will have in place the arrangements for working together which will enable them to draw up plans for using the partnership grant without having to establish new mechanisms, so the partnership grant will create an impetus for partnership working as well as providing new resources for that operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I would like to draw the Committee's attention to two important elements of the joint plan. First, we have asked local authorities to provide information on the contingency plans they have made with their health partners to deal with additional pressures on their services. That will be especially important over the next winter. Secondly, we have, in the guidance on the partnership grant, suggested that authorities might use the partnership grant money to continue projects that has been funded using the additional resources that were provided to the NHS to cope with additional pressures over the winter. Much of that money was used in partnership with social services departments, and the Select Committee on Health, in its recent report, noted how effective those schemes had been. We hope that the partnership grant will be used to ensure that that good work continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partnership grant is not simply a continuation of the old special transitional grant. This is new money for new purposes. It represents a new start in funding for innovative working. Unlike the old STG, there is no need for arguments about whether the grant money has been incorporated into SSAs in the following year because, for the first time, we have introduced certainty into funding for local authorities, social services spending. The CSR settlement is for three years. Each authority will know what money is available for it over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money in the partnership grant will more than adequately cover the costs of additional clients who would previously have been funded from the STG, but the STG was not the best way of providing funding. It was divisive, in that it created two separate funding streams for community care clients. We now want authorities to consider the totality of resources available to them from the new grants and SSAs. Clients do not care whether they are funded from mainstream budgets or from an earmarked grant; they care about whether they get the right services at the right time and when they are needed. The generous overall settlement in the CSR should allow authorities to develop new services and remove barriers to joint working. That must be better for all community care clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Partnership Grant will be paid in 12 equal monthly instalments. Local authorities are asked to submit a joint plan for use of the grant money by the end of May and, where requested to do so, we will work with authorities to help them develop their joint plans. But all the indications are that the experience of developing joint investment plans has given the vast majority of authorities a head start. We have issued guidance on how the grant should be used and will monitor closely the extent to which it is used to improve outcomes for service users. We want to be able to take the experience of those who have made best use of the new money and share it so that improvements are made to services in every local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the prevention grant, we have made clear our intention to put a new emphasis on helping people to achieve and maintain independence wherever possible. The grant forms part of the special effort to achieve that objective. It is focused specifically on encouraging local authorities to take a strategic approach to preventive services for all adult clients groups and to use their resources in a targeted way to support people who have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
been assessed as being at risk of losing their independence and those who are able to benefit from lower-intensity services, which prevent or significantly delay admission to residential or nursing home care or to hospital. The grant is aimed also at helping people to gain or re-enter employment and to enhance their quality of life by so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant is to be used to begin to restore some of the balance that has been lost between high-intensity and low-intensity domiciliary services and to help local authorities to develop preventive strategies. Those must be developed in partnership with other agencies, such as the health service and those responsible for transport, leisure and housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant will have conditions attached. The primary condition is that the entire grant must be used only for the purposes of non-intensive community care services, including the costs associated with the administration of such services, within the financial year 1999–2000. The secondary condition is that authorities must develop a preventive strategy and, by 29 October 1999, provide a written plan that is agreed with relevant health authorities. The strategy should cover the three years to 2001–02 and set out three things. The first is the preventive strategy, which should demonstrate that authorities have worked in partnership with health authorities in their area and involved relevant organisations in drawing up the strategy. Secondly, it should show how they intend to implement the strategy, and include the indicators that they intend to use to monitor their progress towards its implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it should make clear how much of the grant they intend to spend on non-intensive services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The services on which the grant can be spent focus specifically on lower levels of intervention for those people who, on the basis of proper risk assessment, are likely to benefit most from such services in terms of preventing deterioration in their independence. The grant stipulates that at least 75 per cent. must be spent on additional services. Those are services that are either new to the authority, or which are being provided to more people than previously. Although we full acknowledge that some resources will have to be spent on preparing the preventive strategy and the plan, it is important that the majority of the grant money is spent on additional services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the preventive strategy will depend on the involvement of other relevant agencies, so we are issuing guidance on the development of a preventive strategy and a social services inspectorate report identifying examples of good practice policies and processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect authorities to devise means of measuring the progress that they achieve. In doing so, they will wish to take note of the proposed indicators for performance assessment contained in the document "A New Approach to Social Services Performance", which is currently the subject of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall deal with the carers grant. We know that almost all carers need some help and support to enable them to continue to care. That is why, as part of our
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
strategy for carers, the Government are making available to local authorities a new special grant to allow carers to take a break from caring. The carers special grant is intended to enhance provision of community care services. First, it will allow carers to take a break from caring by stimulating greater diversity and flexibility of provisions. Secondly, it should promote greater awareness in local authorities of the need for services in their area that are more responsive to carers' needs. Thirdly, the grant is intended to enable carers and their organisations explicitly to be involved in work by local authorities on the appropriateness of current provision and the possibility of greater diversity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we are attaching two conditions to the carers special grant. The primary condition is that the entire grant must be spent on community care services for people assessed as needing local authority services who live at home and who regularly receive substantial amounts of care from informal carers. That will enable the carers involved to take a break from caring. We intend the services provided to support carers in their role, relieve carer stress, enable them to continue to provide care, promote their social inclusion and maintain then-health, including mental health. In providing those services, local authorities must work in partnership with the NHS, and should take account of relevant recommendations in the carers national strategy report, "Caring about Carers".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secondary condition attached to the grant is that local authorities must provide the Secretary of State for Health with a written plan by 29 October. First, it should set out their expenditure during 1998–99 on the provision of community care services aimed at enabling carers to take a break from caring, and the nature of that provision. Secondly, it should contain an assessment of need for community care services aimed at giving carers a break from caring and proposals for a programme of change and development to diversify and to enhance their provision of those services. That information should reflect the views of users and carers as well as indicators used by the local authority to monitor progress. Thirdly, local authorities should set out in the plan proposals to introduce or improve procedures for the involvement of carers and local carers' organisations in their planning on how the grant money should be spent during the three-year grant period. Finally, the plan should state the percentage of the grant money to be spent on additional services. At least 75 per cent. of the grant should be spent on such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to providing better support for carers than has often been provided in the past. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boteng), now Minister of State for the Home Office, led a recent Government-wide review of measures to help carers as part of the Prime Minister's national strategy for carers. The objectives of the strategy was to bring together across Government a range of new initiatives designed to address carers' concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social services will play an important part in providing much of the practical help needed to assist carers in maintaining their vital caring role. The grant will provide resources to help them carry out their role, and forms a central part of our strategy for carers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
In conclusion, social services are too important to be neglected. The Government are giving them the attention that they deserve, and we will work in partnership with local government and other stakeholders to ensure that everyone in our society can benefit from services fit for the next century. The social services modernisation fund, of which the three grants form a very substantial part, will be a lever for modernisation throughout all social services activities and spending. Through the modernisation fund and wider increases in social services funding we are providing resources to match the plans outlined in the social services White Paper.

We have therefore shown our commitment to improving social services, and have made available substantial additional resources. The special grant reports provide for the distribution to local authorities in England of additional funds totalling £293 million for 1999–2000, to assist them with the important work at which the grants are aimed. They show our clear commitment to achieving improvements in the delivery of social care and in the way in which social services and the NHS work together. Most important, however, they provide vital new resources to bring about improvements in the services that people receive. I commend the special grant reports to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We naturally welcome any money that is made available for social services. The Minister said in his opening remarks that it is all new, ring-fenced money, and that will be the key issue that I shall address. He also spoke about the certainty in funding that local auuiorities' social services departments will have over the next three years as a result of the comprehensive spending review. He said that there will be real terms increases over the next three years in the social services settlement, which he described as a generous overall settlement. It may be generous overall, but it is not generous to all. The certainty in funding that some social services departments face is a grim certainty. I hope that over the next few minutes I shall be able to persuade the Minister to acknowledge that, and thereby to acknowledge that for some social services departments this is not a dollop of additional money that they can spend on new and additional services, to the delight of their citizens, but money that will have perforce to be used to replace the lost special transitional grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the situation is that the social services settlement for local authorities this year is increased by, on average, 5.8 per cent. However, that average conceals a range of increases from 0.5 per cent. to 11 per cent. I readily concede that for an authority that has received an 11 per cent. settlement in its basic social services standard spending assessment, the money will represent a welcome addition. It will be able to look at the exciting suggestions presented in the special grant reports and the local authority circular that was sent out in March with ideas about worthy projects on which the money might be spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, authorities that have suffered much less generous settlements will face a different situation. As a result of the loss of the STG and the changes in the calculation of the SSA, especially in the age weighting
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
factor in the calculation of the SSA, many social services departments find themselves with settlements at or around the level of inflation—in some cases, less than the level of inflation. In addition to those settlements, they have to deal with the inevitable cost pressures that arise from rising demand and they have to find—because the Government assume that they will find—a 2 per cent. efficiency saving. I have been told that the 2 per cent. efficiency saving is very difficult to find when a large part of the budget is spent on outsourcing residential care placements from private sector providers, who are themselves extremely squeezed and facing cost pressures well in excess of the notional level of inflation, partly as a result of Government actions—for example, the nurses' pay settlement. That settlement was welcome, but the Government must recognise that it has had a knock-on cost pressure effect on the operating costs of private sector nursing and care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister drew attention to the fact that there will be winter pressures over the coming winter of 1999–2000. The pressures may be particularly severe, not because of the weather but because of the costs associated with the long millennium holiday and the various dire expectations and predications about it. The Minister has acknowledged that some of the money has to be used, by way of Government plan, to deal with winter pressures in future. Such pressures have been dealt with by special and specific grants during the past two winters. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the background, for some social services departments at least, is one of great pressure on resources while the incremental demand for services continues unabated. In that environment, the concept of additionality, which pervades the documents and the language of the Minister's speech—that there is new money to provide shiny and modem additional services—is far from the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For social services authorities that have received below average grant settlements, the money will be used to plug the gap created by me loss of the special transitional grant and the reductions to the standard spending assessment. The partnership grant conditions make that difficult for an authority to do, but I believe that the Minister knows that mat is what will happen. I believe that he has been approached by directors of the social services departments of authorities that must face such problems. I believe that the Association of Directors of Social Services has made it clear to him that, unless he wants to see the substantial collapse of existing services, some of the money will have to be used to plug the gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disparage that idea. Clearly, it would be absurd to suggest that the money must be used entirely for new services, that money must be used to provide additional services when existing and desperately needed services are in danger of collapse. I object to the Government's presentation to the Committee of a document that purports to espouse the principle of additionality without their addressing what they know will inevitably be the case. In some areas, much of the money will have to be used to plug the gap left by the Government's social services settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at least have the good grace to acknowledge that the fine rhetoric of the documents relates to authorities that have had more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
generous settlements, such as those that enjoyed increases of 10 or 11 per cent. He should understand that, at the other end of the scale, the money will not deliver additional services or improvements to services. It will simply underpin services that would otherwise be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Minister acknowledges that. When Ministers make announcements from the Dispatch Box about apparently large sums of new money, about generous overall settlements and about funds that will be available to provide additional settlements, it is unsurprising that people across the country, including those living in authorities under great financial pressure, look forward to having their share. They will expect additional services to be made available. They will often be disappointed when they discover that the reality in their area is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that authorities with below average settlements will use part of the partnership grant to plug the gap. In some cases, the majority of the grant may be used. If he is not prepared to acknowledge that, will he tell us what he expects social services departments such as the one in Surrey—my local authority—which had a 2.6 per cent. settlement to do? How is a social services department with a 2.6 per cent. settlement to deal with the pressures of inflation and of demand in a way that allows it to use supposedly ring-fenced money to provide wholly new services? I would be interested to know that, the Association of Directors of Social Services would be interested to know that, and I am sure that other members of the Committee would be as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, annex A to special grant report No. 42 makes it clear that it is a condition of the grant being made available that it must be used for additional services. I have already made my view of that pretty clear. The definition of "additional services" in the annex is that the service
	<br><blockquote><p>"has not been provided by the authority between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 1999; or … is provided … to more people between"</p></blockquote>
1999 and 2000 than was the case between 1998 and 1999, or that it will be provided in a more effective way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the document presented to Parliament says, but paragraph 9 of the Department of Health circular sent to social services departments states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Examples of the sort of activity which it would be appropriate to undertake using the grant include the continuation of schemes which have been funded using "winter pressures" money to enable these schemes to become established and integrated into mainstream services".</p></blockquote>
I do not disagree with that perfectly sensible suggestion, but it goes against the grain of what is stated in the document presented to the Committee. The guidance does not suggest that the money must be used to provide additional services; it explicitly suggests to directors of social services, to whom it is addressed, that the money need not be used according to the conditions in the special grant report, but can be used to fund schemes that last year were funded by winter pressures money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, I suspect that that is what will happen; I suspect that it must happen to keep social services departments afloat in the less generously treated
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
parts of the country. However, we ought as a general principle to be wary of documents formally presented to the House suggesting one set of conditions, when guidance to the people who will spend the money suggests a different nuance in the application of those conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a couple of specific questions. Of course, I cannot speak for other members of the Committee, but I would have found it helpful to have been told in the documents the amount of grant likely to be paid for the next three years—for information only. The Government claim it as a triumph that social services departments will be able to budget forward for three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in his opening remarks the Minister said that for all practical purposes we could assume that the grants would remain the same over the three years. That is not what I understand from conversations with directors of social services; I understand that it is expected that the partnership grant will decline over that period, and that the other two grants will increase. My information may be wrong, but it came from a "normally reliable source", as they say in 
	<i>The Sun.</i> Perhaps the Minister will tell me when he winds up the debate whether I have got that wrong, or whether something needs to be explained a little more. That is important, because the conditions on the purposes to which the grants can be put are different for each of the three separate grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister enlighten the Committee as to what was the total of the STG in 1998–99, so that we can draw some conclusions about the overall position of social services departments that will lose the STG in 1999–2000 and will instead gain these three grants, which by my calculation will total £253 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is £293 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful; I thank the Minister for that. That tells us that the new money is £40 million— which is not to be sneezed at, I will happily admit—but it is £40 million, not £250 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but he is wrong. The £293 million is the total value of the three special grants that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Minister's pardon if I have added up the figures wrongly. My calculation was that special grant No. 43, worth £20 million, special grant No. 44, worth £20 million, and special grant No. 42, worth £253 million, give—oh, I must beg the Minister's pardon; it is £293 million in total. But my question remains unanswered. I wanted to know the total STG for the period 1998–99, against which I want to compare the figure that, admittedly, I added up incorrectly. Perhaps the Minister will say how much the STG was when he winds up. I want to find out how the lost STG compares with the gained special grants. I cannot draw any conclusions because I do not have the figures at my fingertips, but I should be genuinely interested to compare them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned about the creation of a health authority veto in relation to the grant. I entirely understand, and have much sympathy with, the idea that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
health authorities and social services departments should work together in preparing plans to deal with vulnerable people, but the way in which conditionality is attached to the grants means that the health authority effectively has a veto—a social services department can obtain the grant only if it presents a plan to the Secretary of State that has been approved by the health authority. Does the Minister think that it might be necessary for the Secretary of State to have a reserved power, so that a local authority could apply to the Secretary of State to dispense with that provision when, perhaps as a result of some local difficulty, there is a blunt inability of the health authority and the social services department to agree on the priority areas to be set in the plan?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be required to set numerical targets by which they will assess their achievements under the programmes to be implemented with moneys made available by these grants. Will the Secretary of State publish those targets in advance of the end of the financial year in question so that members of the public and Members of Parliament are aware of the targets that local authorities must reach in order to qualify for payment of the grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the minor grants—the prevention grant and the carers grant. I am very pleased that a focus on addressing lower levels of dependency underlies the prevention grant. That is a worthwhile objective. There has been a clear bias in the system over the past few years towards focusing money on those with higher levels of dependency. That tendency has been encouraged by the very tight settlements that some social services departments have suffered, which have made it almost inevitable that they have had to focus their resources on those in most need. I am also pleased about the preventive emphasis of the report. I am convinced that we should be directing our efforts at prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minor grants are, however, relatively small sums. I shall refer again to Surrey county council, as I happen to have the figures. It will receive £388,000 in prevention grant and £391,000 in carers grant. The requirements for planning and reporting to the Secretary of State appear relatively onerous for such small sums of money. Once again, that represents a marked centralising tendency, in which money is removed from the SSA for many authorities and offered back to them in the form of ring-fenced grants for which they must prepare and present plans, and on which they must report to the Secretary of State. That throws into question the Government's attitude to elected local authorities— whether they can be trusted to use money for sensible purposes and to set their own priorities, or whether they are to be mere agents of the Secretary of State and Whitehall in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support the carers grant—I said so when it was announced. The overall level of support announced for carers was £140 million—if memory serves me correctly—over three years. The amount allocated for the grant is £20 million. Will the Minister tell us whether, as I suggested, the amount allocated will increase over the next two years, or whether the discrepancy is because some money will be used for other purposes and directed in other ways? Will the Minister also explain why
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
volunteers in voluntary organisations are specifically excluded—that is an express condition attached to the grant—from receipt of this benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, as I said, we welcome money, and would welcome it with open arms if it were all new money. People living in the areas of social services departments such as mine in Surrey will not receive new, additional services to the value of the supposedly ring-fenced grants, because some of the grants will fund social services that would otherwise have to be cut as a result of the below-average settlement that those authorities have received this year. I would be grateful if the Minister would acknowledge that, or tell us how he would like those authorities to continue to fund existing services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I promise not to delay the Committee for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his presentation of the special grant reports. We should recognise that there is some new money, although the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is correct to take the gloss off the idea that it is all new money. Can the Minister explain how the amounts have been calculated for the various local authority areas? Have they been based on the standard spending assessment, and, if so, is the area cost adjustment included in that calculation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of the social services committee on Gloucestershire county council, a constituent told me that SSA stood for Sea Surfers Association, and that frankly, for the relevance it had to local government needs, it might just as well do. The area cost adjustment is important to areas that do not receive it. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out how strapped for cash Surrey county council is. My understanding is that Surrey receives me ACA; Gloucestershire, of course, does not, and has had terrible trouble with its social services provision for a number of years. I do not for a moment suggest that we should take money away from areas that receive the area cost adjustment, but if the Minister would bear in mind for next year's special grants that the ACA distorts the amount that lower-rated authorities receive, I should be extremely grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to ask the Minister about how special grants will be paid. He said that there would be 12 monthly payments. Will they be made in advance? Will they occur at the beginning of the month, or the end of the month after the money has been spent? The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to winter pressures. Would it not be better to provide the special grant quarterly in advance, so that winter pressures can be dealt with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The Govnernment keep talking about joined-up government. I looked through the reports for some mention of transport, because people who receive care services want to be integrated into society. I went to my local disability forum last Saturday, and the question of integration and transport dominated the meeting. Perhaps, in the special grant for carers, something could have been done for people who transport people in care. In the Budget, the Government introduced the first steps towards reducing vehicle excise duty for less-polluting vehicles. Next year's grant should help people who have to carry wheelchairs or other paraphernalia around. The concession for small-engined cars up to 1100 cc—not many wheelchairs will fit in an 1100 cc car—should be increased to 1800 cc, or 2.2 litres for people carrier-type vehicles, for people whose homes include someone who requires transport for that kind of paraphernalia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his comments about the need for social services and health to work more closely together. He will know that it is my party's policy to merge health and social services, because it is an anachronism that health is free at the point of delivery while social services care, especially in lower-funded local authorities, is increasingly being charged for. New charges were introduced this year in my local authority area. I welcome the new money that is being made available by the grants, but will the Minister answer the question about costing and his future plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain me Committee for long, but I wish to ask me Minister a couple of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all me responsibilities for the grants are placed on local authorities, and the grants are mainly for the benefit of local authorities, why does me money come not from the public spending line of me Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions but from that of the Department of Health?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties for county councillors is that while grants such as this are welcome, they can make their lives more complex. Following on from the comments of the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones), could the Minister explain which elements of the formula—if it is using the standard spending assessment—go into making up the allocation for the grants? If it is using the SSA, why is the money not simply allocated to local authorities through the SSA mechanism? If that reflects the Government's view that local authorities are not performing sufficiently well in these areas, mere may be other ways of doing it. Under this Government, we have seen a growing trend in local government towards more ring-fenced grants and less discretion for local councillors as to how they use the funds that are given to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to echo me comment made by my hon. Friend me Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. This year, Oxfordshire county council has set a budget that involves an increase in council tax of 11 per cent. That was a Labour budget. The reason that council tax had to go up by 11 per cent. was that it was the only way that
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Labour county councillors, supported by others, thought that they could ensure mat there would not be substantial cuts in social services provision in Oxfordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be curious to have a situation in Oxfordshire where me county council is having to close day centres for children with special needs because they are a non-statutory provision, at the same time as purporting to need extra money for additional facilities for carers. I suspect that county councillors will have to shoehorn the money in ways that will fill the gaps that result from the reduction in the standard provision of social services mat they received in previous years. However, having to do that in relation to three separate grants—three separate means of reporting—makes their lives that much more complex. Will the Minister share with us some of me Government's broader dunking on how and why it is felt necessary to allocate money in the present way rather than through me SSA formula and the standard formula for allocating money to local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Desmond Swayne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief because my hon. Friends have been eloquent in drawing attention to the issues that are pertinent to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always struck me as proper that the Government, having identified economic problems associated with certain regions of the kingdom, should want to address them. Doing so by tinkering with the standard spending assessment, however, has had unfortunate consequences for other parts of the kingdom. For example, as a result of the changes to the SSA, the shire counties have suffered significant pressure on their budgets. That is particularly true of the social services budget in Hampshire. It has led to all sorts of restraints and pressures. What strikes me as especially improper is that the needs of social services clients in Hampshire are being used to solve a fundamentally economic problem, which should have been dealt with otherwise in other parts of the kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we welcome the money that we are to receive in the form of the grants. Hampshire is to receive a total of £5.4 million as a result of the three grants. However, given me pressure that the social services budget is already under as a consequence of the change to the SSA, the grants come with constraints. There are requirements to draw up a plan and to scrutinise it. We are already under pressure as a result of what social services are doing now. To have to go to all the lengths that are set out in the provisions to secure the additional funds is a most irksome and unwelcome addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have raised several specific, technical questions, to which I shall try my best to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made several observations about the overall settlement for personal social services. Most Labour Members take with a pinch of salt observations that Conservative Members of Parliament make about the tightness of any local government settlement because we have a memory about such things and we do not forget. We are probably not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
well disposed to taking lectures from the hon. Gentleman—well-meaning though I am sure they were— about the adequacy of the local government settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that he is wrong in several key respects in his description not only of this year's settlement but of the purpose and function of the grants. Most important he was wrong when he said that there was no new money, that this was a smoke and mirrors job. That is a load of complete nonsense. We are talking about new money. The hon. Gentleman was at pains to suggest that there was no new money, but it is all new money. It forms part of the £3 billion of additional resources for social services that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to shift the terms of the question, in rather the same way that the Deputy Prime Minister did yesterday. I objected to the Minister saying that this was all new money, but he accuses me of saying that there was no new money. I did not say that at all; I said that in social services departments where the settlements had been especially tight, some of the money would have to be used to plug the gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can argue about the meaning of words and the semantics of what members of the Committee say. The hon. Gentleman is now trying to say that this is not all new money, but presumably he implicitly recognises that some of it is. He might like to tell the Committee how much of it he thinks is new. Before he responds to that point, may I return to the general issue? I welcomed the more positive tone of the remarks of the hon. Member for Cheltenham who also referred to the matter. It is important that we do not become bogged down in an argument about pots of money and types of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned several times the disappearance of the special transitional grant from the money available to local authorities. He failed to appreciate that it is important to look at the overall totals—the overall sums that are going to local authorities. If he were to do his figures, and I am sure that he will because I know how diligent he is, he will come to the same conclusions as I have. Although his maths has let him down a little today, he will realise as I do that there is £523 million of additional money for social services spending this year. That is not a smoke and mirrors job; that is all additional money. The settlement is one of the most generous for personal social services this decade. The hon. Gentleman did neither himself nor other Opposition Members a service by trying to suggest that anything other than that was the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I want to make some progress. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) referred to the difficulties that some authorities have experienced. I acknowledge in Committee, as I have on the Floor of the House, that the settlement seems less generous for some authorities than for others. However, I stress that we have distributed personal services SSAs this year on the basis of strong
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
research evidence accumulated and developed for my Department by the university of York. That work was commissioned by the Conservative party when it was in government to review the basic methodology—the structural and statistical basis on which SSAs are distributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is fairer, based on up-to-date information. Previous SSAs were based on information that was nearly 12 years old, as the hon. Member for Banbury might be aware. We could not afford to continue to distribute significant sums of public money—almost £9 billion for social services—on the basis of research evidence and statistics that were significantly out of date. It was incumbent on us to look at the research basis, at the statistics and at the fairness of the distribution of the money to all authorities. This year's settlement was based on the most up-to-date evidence—the best evidence and the most well-founded research that we had. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said, no social services SSA in England has been reduced. All social services departments in the United Kingdom will have received an increase in Government support of at least 1.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to acknowledge what the Minister has just said. The total increase in the social services allocation is £500 million. Will he in turn acknowledge that that is of scant comfort to someone who lives in a county that has seen a decrease in funding in real terms? The supposedly ring-fenced grants will not, in practice, pay for new and additional services in Surrey, Oxfordshire, Hampshire, Kent, or West Sussex, where the settlements have been extremely tight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to acknowledge that for the reasons that I outlined in my opening remarks to the Committee. New grants, such as the carers grant, are new sources of money to provide local authorities with the resources to do new things. If the hon. Gentleman looked at the section of the special grant report dealing with the conditions, he would have confirmation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to difficulties of efficiency, and to the tightness of the efficiency objectives that we set in the "Aiming for Excellence: Modernising Social Services" White Paper—2 per cent. this year, 2 per cent. next year and 3 per cent. the year after that. I would again take issue with him on that matter. The purpose and thrust of the joint working arrangements—the closer relationship that we want to see between the national health service and social services departments—is to give us a mechanism, effectively for the first time, to improve the efficiency of our use of social services. They will be pooled with NHS resources under the new arrangements outlined in the Health Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keeping people in their homes and preventing their admission to hospital will lead to the more efficient and effective use of resources. I know that those are tough challenges, but they are perfectly obtainable and realisable. I would not want to give any other impression.

The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also complained about the low level of the carers and prevention grant. The grant is increased annually. The first year is for start-ups, for the development of strategies, and for fundamental work that must be put in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
place before significant additional resources can be spent effectively. As many local authorities are starting on a low baseline for the first two years, those two years are for developing strategies and seedcorn funding for new services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge expressed several other concerns about the carers grant. He asked why volunteers are excluded. They are excluded because the grant is for informal carers such as those in families or friends and neighbours. Local authorities can support funding of voluntary organisations with their existing grant-making powers. The carers grant is intended to support individual, informal carers. Other means and mechanisms are available to local authorities to support voluntary organisations that are active in the field of caring. The Department of Health uses grant-making powers under section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 to support a number of important national carers organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned targets. We have no plans to publish targets this year. We have asked local authorities to develop local targets, which they can use to measure their progress. Authorities may wish to publish their plans locally, which would be entirely appropriate, but we have no plans to require them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about what he thought was a contradiction between paragraph 9(f) of me partnership grant guidance document and paragraph 7(b) of the special grant report. I do not believe that any such difference or contradiction exists. Continuing to fund in full winter pressures budgets will mean that the service will be provided to more people. That is perfectly consistent with our definition of additional services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also felt that the special grant report contained what he described as a health authority veto. It does not. We do not expect health authorities to refuse to co-operate, and we have no evidence to suggest that they will not co-operate. We have the option of paying the grant on the grounds of reasonable excuse. I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 10(b) of the special grant report. There is no evidence suggesting that responsible bodies such as health bodies will be anything other than co-operative and fully desirous of supporting the initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cheltenham asked a number of specific questions about the grants and methods of payment. I hope that I made the matter clear, but I am quite happy to provide more information. The grants will be paid monthly, on me 15th of each month. We hope that the first month's payment will be made very soon. The hon. Gentleman referred to quarterly payments and their benefits. The Government were asked by local authority representative organisations to make monthly payments as they did not want us to pay me grant on a quarterly basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Runnymede and Weybridge both asked me for information on years two and three of the special grants. I tried to say in my opening remarks that authorities can for planning purposes assume that they will receive the same share of the national total in later years as they
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
receive in 1999–2000. We could provide the indicative figures if the hon. Gentlemen think that that would be helpful, although we have not yet made a decision. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was right that the amount will decrease, especially for the partnership grant, in years two and three, as I think that I said. For planning purposes, authorities can assume that their share of the grant will not change rather than the specific totals. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not expect me to be able to speak about specific totals for years two and three, for obvious reasons. Like year one, years two and three will be subject to specific parliamentary approval, which I cannot anticipate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Swayne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it be of any value to a budgeting process to know the proportion of the total grant that may be made available to an authority without any idea of what the total grant will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous. The total amounts for the partnership grants in years two and three have already been announced. The methodology by which we distributed those grants in year one is known to local authorities and it is perfectly possible that they might make that calculation themselves, but it is for planning purposes alone. It would be quite inappropriate for Ministers to anticipate parliamentary approval two or three years ahead. It is possible that there may be small changes which will result in the specific distribution to a local authority that might be consequent upon local population changes. For that reason, it would not be appropriate for me to be specific.

I should apologise to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I think that I referred to paragraph 10(b) of the special grant report, when I should have referred to paragraph 10(b) of annex D to the special grant report. My comments were made in relation to the alleged health authority veto to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banbury mentioned a number of concerns that he had about why the money was coming from the Department of Health and not the DETR. It has traditionally come from the Department of Health, because that is the Department responsible for social services within Government. I think that the hon. Gentleman was an Environment Minister in the previous Government, so he will know that the DETR has ultimate responsibility for SSAs. The distribution announcement to local authorities is made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. We are discussing a social services matter today, and social services are the ministerial responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The hon. Gentleman expressed some concern about the increasing use, as he described it, of hypothecation of grants. With respect—I have a great deal of respect for him—I should like to point out that the amounts hypothecated through grants still represent a very small proportion of the total amount of local authority resources. It is about 6 per cent.—a very small amount of total social services expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of the hypothecation is to give effect to a specific purpose, and the purpose is very clear throughout the three grants. We believed that it would be better for service users for there to be that hypothecation in all these cases. It is an obvious instrument by which the Department of Health can be sure that the objectives that we set for these particularly important areas of public policy can be met, and that the money can be used for the purposes that we have identified.
