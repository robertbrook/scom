	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (Limit on Borrowing) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The order was laid before the House on Monday 17 June, under section 3(1) of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986 and with the approval of the Treasury. The purpose of the order is to increase the AEA's statutory borrowing limit from its current £150 million to £200 million. In presenting the order to the House, I believe that it would be helpful if I set it in the context of what is happening at the AEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1986, the Government implemented the recommendations of a review of the activities of the AEA, which were that it should move to a fully commercial basis of operation as a research and development organisation. That was achieved through the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986, which put the AEA on to a trading fund basis. This brought greater flexibility to the AEA to use its internally generated funds to help to finance the agreed capital investment programme. Remaining capital requirements were to be financed through borrowing under powers given under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 3 of the Act set a borrowing limit of £150 million on the AEA and prescribed what would count towards that limit. Five years have now passed since the limit was set and the AEA has continued its development into a fully commercial R and D organisation. It has restructured itself from a geographically based organisation into a series of product-led businesses to focus the AEA's future activities on those with the best commercial prospects. The AEA now has nine semiautonomous businesses, four providing nuclear R and D and five providing non-nuclear or industrial R and D, each with its own chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That commercial approach and the AEA's drive for efficiency and restructuring has been supported by the Government. However, it has resulted in the closure of some of the AEA's larger facilities, in particular the material testing reactor at Harwell and the steam generating heavy water reactor at Winfrith. As a consequence, through a programme of voluntary early retirements, the AEA has reduced its manpower from more than 13,000 in March 1989 to less than 10,000 in March 1991, and it is projected to be almost down to 8,000 by March 1995. The cost of those early retirements and the associated relocation of staff and assets to reduce overheads must be met if the AEA is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
benefit from the savings in the future. As a result, the AEA's borrowing has increased to the extent that it would now be prudent for the borrowing limit to be raised to £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, raising the borrowing limit does not, in itself, enable the AEA to increase its borrowings. The AEA will continue to be subject to the disciplines of the external financing limit. The need for further long-term loans will be scrutinised each time the AEA requests them; then, if appropriate, my Department and thhe Treasury will endorse the requests before the national loans fund makes any funds available. Similarly, proposals for the AEA to increase its temporary borrowing limit within the overall £200 million will require Government approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Order is approved. It is a measure which will help the AEA to seek the levels of borrowing appropriate to its financing needs for restructuring to improve its efficiency. That, in turn, will help the AEA to develop into a fully competitive, commercial R and D organisation. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some questions for the Minister about the AEA. Opposition Members will not oppose the order. We should compliment the AEA on diversifying away from the nuclear industry in its future business. I am pleased that more of the AEA's businesses now deal with industrial research and development—not necessarily nuclear research and development. Because of the state of the nuclear industry after privatisation, it seems sensible to diversify in that way—at least until 1994, when the future of nuclear power will be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was reported in the press last year that the AEA was considering selling the lease on its headquarters, which was then at Piccadilly circus, and closing a research establishment at Culcheth near Warrington, which was on prime building land. I assume that the Minister is happy that, if those sales took place and the AEA were happy with the returns, an increase in the AEA's borrowing might not be necessary. The Opposition do not want to prevent the order being passed or to stop the AEA's research and development, especially as there is a constant need for research and development to ensure safety in the parts of the nuclear industry that remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) for his general support for the order. I agree with him about the need for the AEA to diversify into industrial and non-nuclear activities I, too, should like to complement the AEA on the success that it has achieved so far in that diversification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Asset sales are a matter for the AEA. I agree that it must consider critically the need for its existing property and assets. Where assets are surplus to requirements, the AEA will seek to place them on the market. To some extent, that could offset the need for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
additional borrowing. Even with the most optimistic view of the property market, its overall borrowing will increase to finance its investment needs and to pursue the restructuring which I mentioned. Therefore, the prospect of asset sales does not reduce the need for the order, which will increase the borrowing limit to £200 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
