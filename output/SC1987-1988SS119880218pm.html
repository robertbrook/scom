	<i>Amendment proposed (this day):</i> No. 432, in page 18, line 5, leave out from "below" to "may" in line 8 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tenant under a short assured tenancy".]—[
	<i>Mr. Home Robertson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disturbed by the language of the clause, and am for once indebted to the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), for understanding the clause and to my honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) for pointing out its fallacies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be impossible for a tenant to establish that his rent is higher or lower than any other, except by illegal or impertinent means. The phrase "significantly higher" has no significance, and the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"under similar tenancies of similar houses</p></blockquote>
seems to beg a question. In, say, Dunfermline, all the houses in a row may be similar, but some may have tenancies in the basement, in the top, or at the back. Some may be quiet, or noisy, some may have more facilities than others, some may have central heating and some double glazing. What are the characteristics of similarity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of the clause is incomprehensible and meaningless. It is not a test by which a tenant could establish an appeal to the tribunal. I suggest that the normal phrasing of such a provision would be that, if the tenant considers that the rent payable under the tenancy is unreasonable or unfair, in all the circumstances, he may apply to the rent assessment committee. It is for that committee to adjudge the tenant's reasons for thinking that the rent is unfair and unreasonable, and whether he is right. The rent assessment committee may take all relevant factors into account, including, for example, that the tenant's house is at the end of a row, or on a roundabout; that he cannot sleep at night and lorries are parked outside
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
his house; and it is therefore quite different from the house at the other end of the row.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only burden on the appellant should be a criterion that he has reason to believe that, in all the circumstances, the rent is unreasonable or unfair. A tribunal should operate on that sort of language of statute. I humbly commend to my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State that he gives an undertaking that the clause will be rephrased to form a criterion that a tenant can achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may have been dealt with in my absence at our previous sitting, but at some stage we should consider at length the question of rent assessment committees. That would technically be incompetent under the amendment, but the Committee would benefit from asking questions about rent assessment and the provision of staff and from hearing the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) made the pertinent point that there is currently only one full-time member of staff to serve the Lothian and Borders regions. That is hopelessly inadequate. The Government should not try to operate the new regime with that level of staffing. What provision is being made for manpower requirements, and where will the offices be? How are people to apply? What provisions are being made to advertise services, and what resources are being made available generally to set up a sensible number of rent assessment committees to deal with the Bill's provisions? Will the Government set out guidelines?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions may be technically wide of the amendment, and it may be better to have such a debate on clause stand part. I do not care when it is done, but it would help the Committee if we sought the Government's view on those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I subscribe to what both Conservative and Opposition Members have said on the amendment. The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) made a thoughtful contribution. The problem of working out comparisons with similar properties will be made slightly worse because, once the poll tax is implemented we shall not have the valuation roll for domestic subjects. That will create additional difficulties. At the moment, the rateable values of properties can at least be considered, and are listed on a public document to which people have access. That document will no longer be with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I caution the honourable Gentleman before he says too many kind things about the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart). That honourable Gentleman did not want Scottish Homes' tenants to have any recourse to the rent assessment committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with everything that the honourable Member for Eastwood said, but he made a balanced contribution, and put forward his view clearly. He expressed some anxiety about the clause, and I agree with much—though not all—of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
How will rent assessment committees implement the provisions of the clause? The principal source of my thinking on the matter is the brief supplied by the Law Society of Scotland and I agree that the Bill's provisions give no yardstick against which the rent assessment committee can test the question of reasonableness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does not the Bill prescribe criteria? Section 48 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 specifies a series of provisions and criteria—a set of yardsticks—which are to be taken into account when determining a fair rent. Those are clearly set out in the primary legislation, and can be implemented and acted upon by the rent assessment committee. I cannot understand why the Bill does not have an equivalent set of provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland says that the clause is "circuitous and that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be difficult for the Rent Assessment Committee to properly apply".</p></blockquote>
Again there is some doubt about the interpretation of the clause. The society interprets the wording to mean that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Rent Assessment Committee is required to assess the rent for the short assured tenancy on the basis of what would normally be received in respect of such a tenancy."</p></blockquote>
The society states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee has no yardstick against which to gauge its assessment of a 'reasonable' rent."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the clause should prescribe the criteria",</p></blockquote>
It says that the minimum provision necessary to do that would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"by prescribing that the Rent Assessment Committee shall not make a determination unless 'there is a sufficient number of similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality'".</p></blockquote>
In the border areas it would be impossible for a rent assessment committee to obtain in good faith a sufficient body of evidence to enable it to make the assessment. The Law Society's suggesstion would at least make it easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland also says—that it would make a provision to ensure that the Rent Assessment Committee would not make a determination unless the rent
	<br><blockquote><p>"is significantly higher than the landlord might reasonably be expected to be able to obtain having regard to the level of rents payable"</p></blockquote>
under similar tenancies. Those are suggestions made by the Law Society of Scotland and the Government should pay them more attention. There should be clearly prescribed guidelines for the Rent Assessment Committees. At the moment, it would be impossible for the clause to be operated effectively in my constituency. I have serious misgivings about the level of resources that the Government propose to devote to Rent Assessment Committees to enable them to provide an effective service to those people who apply to them. It is unsatisfactory for the Government to expect people to catch a bus from Hawick to Edinburgh to attend hearings and make applications. The amendment is important and I hope that the Minister will deal with some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
points made by the Law Society of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are 150 members on the panel from which members of the Rent Assessment Committees are selected. Three members on each Rent Assessment Committee are drawn from the panel of 150 lawyers, surveyors and laypersons. They can meet anywhere. The honourable Gentleman asked how many Rent Assessment Committees there were. There are currently about 12. The Scottish Offices must bid for funds in the normal public expenditure round, as for all Civil Service staff costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the Minister is trying to be helpful. Have the manpower requirements not yet been worked out? He is talking about future bids for money to be made by the Scottish Office. I am surprised, as I should have thought that the manpower provisions, financial requirements and the money resolution attached to the Bill would have taken account of at least ball park figures for the increase in resources and staff required to operate the Rent Assessment Committees as proposed in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle is that the funding resources must be adequate to meet the requirements for the setting up of the committees. I made it clear earlier that that would probably involve more staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman also mentioned advertising services. The staff are Scottish Office civil servants in the Scottish Develpment Department based in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen. I should also stress that a Rent Assessment Committee can be set up ad hoc to hear a case. It can be set up anywhere in Scotland that suits the parties involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked earlier how tenants will know what the rents are. There will be a public record of the Rent Assessment Committees' decisions, which will be important. My honourable Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) argued for realistic safeguards for tenants and my honourable and learned Friend for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) made a strong plea for reasonableness. I also listened with interest to the comments of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the words that the amendment seeks to delete is to deter frivolous or groundless applications by tenants who could not possibly consider that the rent that they are paying was significantly more than the going rate, either because there is no evidence, so the Rent Assessment Committee would not be able to make a determination anyway, or because the rent is so low that the tenant making such an application is merely chancing his arm. The words will avoid, or make less likely, time wasting applications to the Rent Assessment Committee by tenants who take the view that, however reasonable or even low their rent, it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
always worth trying to get it reduced. I have listened to the arguments and will re-examine the matter but I am not convinced that any changes re necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were a question of whether the Rent Assessment Committee decided that the appeal was frivolous and declined to hear it, the words might act as a deterrent. However, the clause states that if the tenant considers the rent too high, he may make an application. It does not matter what words follow, because if the tenant decides to chance his arm and make a frivolous appeal, he will do so. He will not be deterred by reading clause 31. It will be just as time wasting for the tribunal whether he has been unable to satisfy the criterion of the words of the clause or the words suggested by the Opposition. Their words will not save one appeal, because it is the tenant who considers whether to appeal. Whether the appeal is granted will depend upon the words. If the tribunal is to speed up its work and be equitable, the criterion must be described in words that are capable of sensible interpretation. The tribunal's work will be infinitely lengthened if the words remain. The test should be fair and reasonable in all circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested by what my honourable learned Friend said. Tenants should not be discouraged from approaching rent assessment committees. The arguments for and against the amendment are evenly balanced and I shall carefully re-examine the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment further on one two points made by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). It is impossible to estimate how many staff will be needed as we do not know how many short assured tenancies there will be, but I accept that we must be able to respond rapidly. The staff will be civil servants and will be allocated to jobs in response to demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take up the Minister's point about staff being available to Rent Assessment Committees. He told us that there were 150 members on the panel available to serve on the committees, including lay members, specialist lawyers and surveyors. Three of them will serve on each committee to assess a rent and there are 12 such committees functioning in Scotland from different bases. It is not clear how many staff there are to service them, but I understand that there is only one full-time member of staff to serve the whole Lothian and Borders area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Memorandum at the front of the Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some increase in central government manpower will be necessary as a result of the new role for rent officers in relation to applications for housing benefit and perhaps of the new functions under part II for the Rent Assessment Panel."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the word "perhaps". The procedure bypasses the rent officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives the tenants direct access to the rent assessment committee or to the panel. It is inevitable, given the circumstances in which short assured tenancies are to be set up, that many people will try to mitigate the level of rent that they have to pay. We shall press the Minister further—perhaps on clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
stand part—about services available to rent assessment committees and tenants' access to them. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said that it is not easy for someone in the remoter reaches of his constituency to make contact with the clerk of the rent assessment committee for Lothian and Borders, who works in the Scottish Office in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to delete a sentence from subsection (1) in order to remove all shadow of doubt that a tenant should have direct access to the rent assessment committee. The Minister explained that the sentence is there to deter frivolous applications. We have already said that the leglislation is tailor-made for creating litigation. As the Bill is drafted, a tenant who feels that his rent is excessive—even though he does not have direct access to information about rents for comparable properties in the same neighbourhood—can ask the rent assessment committee to investigate and conduct a hearing but the committee may feel obliged to reject the initial application because the tenant does not have sufficient information about rent levels in the area. The condition in subsection (1) is unworkable and frivolous. I am glad that the Minister, following pressure from us and representations—although perhaps differently motivated—from the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and the learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), has undertaken to reconsider the matter. However, I have some misgivings about all the concessions we have obtained because it may mean that consideration on Report will be protracted. Many small details will have to be dealt with, but we shall let the Minister get away with the assurance that he gave on the clear understanding that he intends to table an amendment on Report to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman said that there is only one member of staff for Edinburgh and the Lothians. There is a clerk who is mainly responsible for running the office services in Edinburgh, but 12 others serve the commitees as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to future staff requirements, the rent assessment committee's role as appeal forum for rent registrations will gradually decline as the new assured tenancies come into effect. That will counterbalance to some extent workload generated by the new proposals. Therefore, we do not expect a huge increase in the numbers of staff required, but we shall keep the matter under review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the objection to setting out criteria, as the Law Society suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider setting criteria for the operation of the rent assessment committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The surveyor will usually be a local estates surveyor who is experienced in valuation of property in the area. I shall look again at the points made and reconsider the drafting, but that is as far as I can go at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider also the dilemma that will face tenants and rent assessment committees when they have to deal with an entirely new form of tenancy? How will the committee establish a comparable rent for comparable tenure if no such tenure has existed before? In the initial stages there will be special difficulties. Inevitably landlords will try to jack up rents. That is in the nature of the system. If they think that they can get away with setting a higher threshold of rents in the neighbourhood, they will do so. As the Bill is drafted I do not see how the tenants or the rent assessment committee can guard against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has undertaken to consider the matter, and on that understanding I shall press the amendment, although I am in some trepidation about the Report. We shall have to give detailed consideration to the matter on the Floor of the House, which will be fascinating for our colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom. It would far more satisfactory to deal with these matters in committee, but it seems that the Minister is not ready to do so, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 369, in clause 31, page 18, line 8, after "locality", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or rent or rents at which the house might reasonably be expected to be let under a short assured tenancy in the open market".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 433, in page 18, leave out lines 15 to 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 381, in page 18, leave out lines 19 to 25 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the rent payable under any short assured tenancy in question is significantly higher than the rent which the landlord might reasonably be expected to be able to obtain under the tenancy, having regard to the level of rents payable under any short assured tenancy in the locality.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with the powers of rent assessment committees to determine rents for short assured tenancies where a tenant has referred the rent to a committee because it is excessive in comparision with similar rents in the area. Subsection (3) prevents rent assessment committees from determining such rents unless there are sufficient similar tenancies of similar houses in the area to make a comparison possible, and unless the rent is significantly higher than the landlord might reasonably be expected to obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Confedertation of Scottish Local Authorities and Shelter have suggested amendments to subsection (3) because they feel that the restrictions on Rent Assessment Committee's powers are unjustified. I think that all Opposition Members agree with them. Shelter has advanced a strong case for deleting the whole of subsection (3). It would like the Minister to produce new wording. Shelter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As currently worded, a Rent Assessment Committee cannot make a determination of a rent referred by a tenant under short assured tenancy unless it considers that a) there is a sufficient number of similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality and b) the rent payable is significantly higher than the landlord might reasonably be expected to obtain having regard to similar
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
tenancies of similar houses in the locality. The requirement at a) which must be met before the Rent Assessment Committee can make a determination will effectively rule out the Rent Assessment Committees making any determinations in the short-term as there are very few short tenancies at present and a "pool" of short tenancies, ie similar tenancies for the purpose of this part of the Bill cannot possibly spring up overnight."</p></blockquote>
If the Bill is passed in its present form, rent assessment committees will not be able to make the comparisons that subsection (3) requires them to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be remembered that, for the purposes of housing benefit subsidy, Rent Officers are to be asked to make an assessment of whether the rent in payment is reasonable for housing benefit claimants. If, after valuation, the Rent Officer considers that a lower rent would be reasonable, he will notify the local authority of this assessed figure. This figure will be the maximum rent on which subsidy will be paid. In the Consultation Paper, the Government accept that although the rent officer will take market rents as the basis for his assessment, "at least initially, there is likely to be insufficient market evidence in many cases. In these cases the rent officer will fall back on a rate of return method."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Given that there is acceptance that in the short term at least, there is likely to be insufficient market evidence for comparison but that this will not prevent Rent Officers adopting a method of assessing whether the rent in payment is reasonable where the tenant has made a claim for housing benefit, there is no reason why Rent Assessment Committees should be prevented from considering an application from a tenant for a determination of a rent simply because there is insufficient market evidence."</p></blockquote>
That is the pool of similar tenancies to which paragraph (3)(a) refers.

	<br><blockquote><p>"The current phrasing, that the rent must be significantly higher than the rent which the landlord might reasonably be expected to obtain under the tenancy before the Rent Assessment Committee can make a determination (provided they are satisfied that there are sufficient comparables) is likely to cause untold problems. The question of what constitutes "significant"—</p></blockquote>
raised by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn) with regard to tenants making applications under the clause—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is very much an open one and open to wide interpretation. Beyond the important fact that a Rent Assessment Committee would not be able to determine a rent where they considered that a rent was higher but not significantly so (however defined) the use of this word is likely to increase litigation, with appeals against Rent Assessment Committees' interpretations of significantly. Surely it is not the Government's intention to take up court time with such matters."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is creating numerous problems for himself, tenants and rent assessment committees by the wording of the clause. He should at least delete "significantly" from paragraph (b). If he wishes to be fair to everyone involved, he should accept amendment No. 433, which deletes subsection (3). He should reword the subsection so that rent assessment committees are allowed to determine appeals from tenants when they have been properly lodged. Shelter has highlighted the serious problems that exist under the present wording of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The rent assessment committees would have immense problems in the Borders in discharging their duties under the clause. How does the Minister envisage the rent assessment committees operating where no data and evidence of a comparable nature will be available? I worry that a monopoly will be the result and that tenants will have no choice. There may well be implications for housing benefit if there are no controls to prevent abuse. In rural areas, claims for housing benefit may be increased artificially because of the way that landlords operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am uncertain about how the provision will operate in the Borders. I am satisfied that machinery will be set up that will be efficient in the central industrial belt and other parts of Scotland where comparisons in tenancies may be drawn, but in rural areas comparators will not be available from which to work from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked about the Law Society of Scotland and general arrangements for rural Scotland. The suggestions that the Opposition have made may tend to reflect the discretion of the rent assessment committee, but the same could be argued about the Bill as drafted. We shall have to consider how best the criteria should be expressed to guide the Committee without inhibiting its determinations. An explanatory leaflet will be available as usual on the important matter of advice to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) concentrated on the words "significantly higher". I have already undertaken to consider those words in relation to the earlier paragraph, so I shall do again in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate highlights the fundamental difference of approach between the Government and the Opposition. We believe that the surest way to achieve more and better rented housing is by getting rid of unnecessary and restrictive controls that interfere with the proper operation of the market. The Opposition believe in imposing restrictions and controls, thus distorting the market, and in the long run damaging the interests of tenants as much as landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 369 and the others in the group are taken together, every short assured tenancy would be referred to the rent assessment committee, even when the rent was obviously reasonable. That would be a waste of the committee's time and it would delay its consideration of serious cases, thus running the risk of allowing unreasonable rents to apply longer than necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I recognise that the Opposition are genuinely worried that in the early stages of the new assured and short assured tenancy arrangements, there will not be sufficient short assured tenancies in the area for the rent assessment committee to make a fair comparison. All I can say to that is that I disagree. I am confident that there will be quickly sufficient evidence for rent assessment committees to reach a well-balanced judgment. Their findings will be made public. The Opposition are exaggerating any
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
difficulties which might arise, but I have listened carefully to them both on this and the previous amendment. I shall certainly look at the matter again but without any hard-and-fast commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be burning the midnight oil for a long time considering all that. We may have to defer consideration on Report until Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berkwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for raising the special difficulties that are likely to arise in rural Scotland. It is clear that Conservative Members think that a significant number of the 90,000 empty private houses are in rural Scotland. They are probably right; they are probably semi-derelict farm cottages in obscure corners of the Highlands or the Borders that have been standing empty for years. The Government think that this provision is a magic potion whereby they will be able to make houses plentiful and that people will be trekking their way up highland glens looking for accommodation. How can a rent assessment committee assess what is a reasonable rent for a wee cottage in some remote corner of the Borders when it may be 10, 20 or 30 miles from the next property which will be subject to this form of tenure, and which may be a different type of accommodation? It depends whether the house is in a village or small town, or totally isolated without access to public services. I presume that the rent assessment committee will need to take those matters into account. The Minister says that he is confident that the rent assessment committees will rise to the task, but I wonder about that, and about the timescale of their operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with tenancies that may be as short as six months initially, and thereafter cannot run for longer than two months. After the first six months' tenancy, a tenant may be notified by the landlord that his rent will be increased for the ensuing two months. He must then deal with that problem by getting on his bike, finding the nearest telephone box that still works, and contacting the rent assessment committee in Edinburgh. Its members will then climb into their limousine and drive to Cappercleugh, or wherever, to inspect the tenant's house and consider what may be a fair rent. But first, they must discover whether a comparable house exists in the neighbourhood. It will take time to find that house, form an opinion, conduct a hearing and then put into writing all the relevant information. By then, the two months' tenancy may have ended, and the argument would be somewhat academic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be making heavy weather of my point and I appreciate that I am intruding on a debate introduced by my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). However, the machinery that the Government are setting up is unworkable and unreasonable. I am trying to read the headline of the leaflet that the honourable Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) is holding up. I caution him for commenting on majorities, because there are not many Conservative Members present and he risks losing his quorum.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate is fascinating, and the longer it continues the less I see a case for including clause 31. I presume that the justification for referring to the rent assessment committee with respect to rents under short assured tenancies is to guard against the danger of landlords abusing their monopoly powers. As Opposition Members have said, the reference to the rent assessment committee cannot apply to a single house in a rural area, but it is precisely there that the monopoly power could be exercised because the tenant has no immediate choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the restrictions and references would apply in urban areas where comparable properties exist, the monopoly element would be the least in such areas because there is a range of properties and tenants have a reasonable choice and can move if they consider that the rent is too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause creates a fundamental problem. The mechanism will probably be more trouble than it is worth. I ask my honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State whether the clause needs to be implemented at the same time as the rest of the Bill. Given the complexities that have come to light during the discussion, there is a good case for the Government not to implement the clause, or at least first, to see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause will be implemented when the rest of the Bill is enacted because of the monopoly element to which my honourable Friend and the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) refer. In remote rural areas, tenants need such a safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), the Department has discussed the operation of the proposed duties with the president of the rent assessment council, who foresees no problems, even in rural areas. Rent officers already have such duties, although different criteria are used. However, I admit that there are difficulties, and we shall take them into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking not about rent officers but entire rent assessment committees. Is the Minister satisfied that rent assessment committees can deal with appeals within the two months' maximum renewed stage of a short assured tenancy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, anybody can respond with sufficient speed and effectiveness if it spends enough on staff and resources. As I said earlier to the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, rent assessment committees must have sufficient staff and resources to do the job properly. At present, the timing between an application and a hearing is two to three months,
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
and I assume that the procedure will remain the same, but on a much wider scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he would reconsider the matter with no hard-and-fast commitment. I do not know what that means. Will he clarify whether he is prepared to redraft the clause and to change its meaning? He has not dealt with the essential problem that subsection (3) throws up. He accepted that in the early stages of the leglislation's operation there would be no pool of similar tenancies against which rent assessment committees could judge. Clause 31(3)(a) clearly states that, unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a suffcient number of similar tenancies of similar houses in the locality",</p></blockquote>
rent assessment committees cannot determine the rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, in the early stages of a short assured tenancy, tenants will have no proteciton against landlords who demand excessive rents. They will be unable to appeal to the rent assessment committee at that stage because there will be no pool against which the rent assessment committee can judge their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reality. The Minister says that that will change very quickly. How quickly is "very quickly"? Will tenants be bereft of any rights until the first or the third year after the Bill's enactment? It is nonsense for the Minister to argue that unless the restrictions are placed on the rent assessment committee, there will be a flood of referrals and virtually every short assured tenancy will be referred to the committee. The Minister knows that all protected tenants already have the right to refer their rent to the rent assessment committee. How many referrals are made every year? Does the Minister have the statistics? There is no flood now and there will not be one if subsection (3) is deleted from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister poses as a friend of tenants and a protector of tenants' rights. The honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) has suggested that we take all rights away from tenants and have a trial period in which landlords may do as they wish. That seems to be his answer to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is misleading the Committee if he says that the only basis for rejecting the Shelter amendment is that there would be a flood of short assured tenancies referred to the rent assessment committee. He knows that that is not true. He gave the game away when he said that the Conservative party wanted to remove positive controls and to allow the market to operate freely. That really means allowing the landlords to do as they wish, without restrictions, controls or protection for tenants. Unless the Minister is prepared to accept the Shelter amendment, I shall not withdraw amendment No. 369.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reinforce my self-interested constituency point. I am deeply perplexed and distressed by how the clause will apply to my constituents who seek short assured tenancies in one of the most rural areas of Scotland. The Minister has given me no satisfaction about how they will obtain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
their rights and protection in the circumstances of a monopoly. I do not go as far as the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) and say that we should throw out everything because that would mean throwing the baby out with the bath water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not be doing my job properly if I did not try to get more satisfactory answers on how the clause will apply to rural areas. There is no prospect of any of the clause's provisions applying to my constituency. The Minister may disagree, but I know the housing stock better than he does and I am sure that I am right. My constituency is not unique, and we are faced with a glaring omission in an unsatisfactory part of the Bill. Unless the Minister can give us more satisfying assurances, he must re-examine this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said when I first responded to the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that I was confident that there would be a sufficient body of evidence for rent assessment committeess to reach well-judged determinations.

	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
after "he", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or the local authority on his behalf.</p></blockquote>
I have listened with interest to how the debate has developed, and particularly to the comments by the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Mr. Fairbairn), whom I understood has elicted from the Minister an undertaking to look again at the entire clause, and not merely at the specific aspects dealt with by the previous amendments. Will the Minister confirm that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous debates the Minsiter said that there are good landlords and bad tenants. The opposite of that applies also. There are many examples of bad landlords within the private sector, and the amendment tries to deal with that reality. Bad landlords harass tenants and place them under duress. Under clause 31 they can try to stop a tenant making a referral to the rent assessment committee. The amendment tries to allow the local authority to act on behalf of the tenant in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that bad landlords exist and that their actions may include putting tenants under duress and trying to stop them exercising their rights. The amendment will give tenants greater protection. If the Minister is genuinely interested in tenants' rights, he should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there can be good and bad landlords, just as there can be good and bad tenants. I regret that I cannot agree with the amendment, which harks back to the obsession that local authorities should have a finger in every pie and should take part in every housing procedure. This issue involves a contract, which is freely negotiated between two responsible persons. The whole principle of the legislation is that leases should be of that nature in future and that the local authority has no part to play directly in appearing for one side or the other in settling disputes about terms of a contract, which is what a lease is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that the tenant may not be able to present his case persuasively enough, or may be intimidated by the landlord into not presenting his case. If the tenant cannot present his case for himself, he can get help from others. As the procedure of the rent assessment committee is relatively informal, that need not be the services of a solicitor, for example, which would in practice would have been necessary if amendments tabled—earlier by the Opposition—had succeeded in transferring that responsibility from the rent assessment committee to the sheriff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using the scenario favoured by the Opposition, if a tenant fears his landlord too much to use a procedure that shields him from excessive rents, I find it difficult to believing that such a landlord would be taken in by the fact that the local authority made the application on the tenant's behalf. Any landlord would be able to to work out that that could hardly have happened without the tentant's knowledge, consent, and co-operation. The bad landlord, whom the honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) has in mind, might be too
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
scrupulous in observing the legal niceties of the distinction between a tenant and his agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases of abuse or breaking the law should become matters for the police. I have had to go to the police many times in my constituency when tenants have brought certain matters to my attention. The amendment would be ineffective for the purpose which it is designed to serve. It reflects the out-dated idea that the local authority must get involved in every housing matter, and always on the side of the tenant. The is a one-sided view, on which I have commented before. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to private landlords. I am not aware that even this Government have got round to privatising local authorities—although I should perhaps not suggest that because it may be in the pipeline. The Minister was suggesting that a tenant on the receiving end of such treatment from an irresponsible or rapacious landlord should either go to his Member of Parliament, who could do something about it, or to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingham) has made a practical and sensible suggestion. Local authorities could perform a useful role. They provide funding for citizen advice bureaux and other advisory services so that people living in the area can avail themselves of their legal rights. Elected councillors are in contact with the people they represent. There are shop fronts in the main towns of the authority's area so that people know where to go for advice about problems. A local authority is uniquely suited to carry out such a function.

5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told over recent months and years of the multitude of ways in which private organisations and landlords can interfere in the operations of local authorities. Indeed, we shall be debating a clause later in the Bill which will enable private landlords to put in bids for local authority housing stock, so that they can be ahead of local authorities, and build empires in different parts of Scotland. Why cannot local authorities if they are asked, have the right to represent tenants in the private sector who believe that they are suffering unfair treatment from their landlords? The Minister is characteristically dismissive about the positive and constructive role that local authorities could play, and I invite him to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Listening to Opposition Members, one can believe that the world is split into goodies and baddies. The goodies are the local authorities and the baddies are anyone else, such as private landlords. The world is not like that. There are good and bad local authorities. It is not realistic to write such a provision into legislation. My honourable Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland summed it up beautifully. There are answers if people have problems. Members of the Committee regularly see people with problems, especially regarding local authority housing, which have to be dealt with on an ongoing basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that the principle is the same. It proves my point. Someone who is harassed by a private landlord is frightened to go to the police. The Minister, acting on that person's behalf, calls in the police to investigate the case. In those circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to allow local authorities to act on behalf of tenants, but the Government are not prepared to allow that because of their obsessive hatred of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should accept the amendment. HE should recognise that the local authority acts in the community's interest. I am not making a political point. I am sure that whatever the political complexion of a local authority, it would act in what it believed to be the best interests of the people who resided in the area. If a councillor or council official discovered cases of tenants being harassed by private landlords, they might consider referring the matter not to the police, but to the rent assessment committee set out in clause 31. That is not an unreasonable proposition. I ask the Minister to reconsider because he rejects the amendment out of hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The harassment provision bites on all landlords not just private landlords.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make some rather uncharitable comments about the clause but when the honourable Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) came like a caveman out of the backwoods of suburban Glasgow, and suggested that there should be no recourse at all to rent assessment committees—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not my position.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the honourable Member. I thought that he was even further to the Right than he originally seemed.

I am glad that we have had an opportunity to clear up that minor misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that the provision does not go far enough. There are a range of shortcomings in the machinery that the Government are establishing to enable tenants in short assured tenancies to ensure that their rents are set at a fair level. There is a bit too much market and not enough fairness. But we should be thankful for small mercies and be grateful that the Government have included this provision in the Bill. We are grateful to the Minister for undertaking to re-examine the clause to try to tidy up the apparent ambivalence in subsection (1) in particular which could make it unnecessarily difficult for a tenant who feels that he is paying too high a rent to get something done about it. The Minister has undertaken to look at the clause with a view to improving it on Report. Perhaps he will tell us more about that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is very little that I should say at this stage. I shall obviously consider the criteria for the tenant and the rent assessment committee.

	<div class='clause'>Clause 32</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>TERMINATION OF RENT ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE'S FUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 373, in page 18, line 46, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Before considering making such an order, the Secretary of State shall consult the district council within whose area such houses are situated".</p></blockquote>
This is a strange clause. It allows the Secretary of State to disapply the rent assessment committee's functions in relation to excessive rents for short assured tenancies. The notes on clauses state that subsection (1) provides for that power to be exercised in particular areas or with particular characteristics. The Minister owes it to the Committee to explain what the particular areas and characteristics are in which the Secretary of State would intervene to disapply the rent assessment committee's functions. The mind boggles at the clause. Would one such area be one where there is little support for the Conservative party? Would a particular characteristic be where the Conservative party has friends in the city? Some people might have an interest in imposing exessive rents which also contribute to the Conservative party. Are those the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might intervene? Anything could apply under the clause. It would be wrong for the Committee to allow the clause to go through unless the Minister puts on the record exactly what the particular areas and characteristics are in which the Secretary of State could use the powers conferred on him by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we are discussing excessive rents it is important for local authorities to be involved. A strong central theme of the Bill has been the fact that local authorities are to be given a strategic role in relation to housing in their areas. Part of that strategic role will be to have an oversight of rent levels. The amendment asks that before any such powers are exercised by the Secretary of State he takes into account any views expressed by district councils. That is reasonable, especially when the Secretary of State has been given wide powers which could be used in a party-political sense. It is important that before he applies these powers he consults the people who have the strategic responsibility for housing in the area, namely the district councils. I hope that the Minister will accede to this reasonable request.
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
Above all, I hope that he outlines in great detail where such powers would be applied by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my honourable Friend responds to the amendment I hope that he will confirm that these orders will be put through the Houses in the normal way which will mean that Parliament will have an opportunity to pray against or initiate a debate on them. In that case the area affected could have its problem aired in the House of Commons where the decisions are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I hope my honourable Friend will bear in mind that whatever Government are in power at a given time consultants alone would not stop them behaving politically as feared by the honourable Member for Dundee East (Mr. McAllion). The only safeguard against that is not protacted negotiations and consultations, but a debate on the Floor of the House, where honourable Members can raise matters that they deem to be political, despite the Government of the day, with their majority still, as the honourable Gentleman fears, behaving politicaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another example of duff law. I subscribe to the view of the honourable Member for Dundee, East who said that if there are reasons in the Government's mind which justify disapplication they should be listed. That is crystal clear. The clause has two subsections. One potentially stifles opposition by saying that the order to disapply will be subject affirmative resolution. That means that we could air views on the locality. That is important as far as it goes—for an hour and a half after Ten o'clock. But these debates are fairly meaningless in terms of achieving change. They may air grievances, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consultation will not achieve anything either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not discussing consultation. I am arguing that the second half of the clause does not begin to meet the need to consider the justification for disapplication. There is no excuse for introducing such blanket legislation, without reason and with no quarter given to any criticism. The Secretary of State shall decide at his whim and fancy what shall justify disapplication in clause 32. That seems hopelessly wrong and it is a misguided way of applying primary legislation. The Committee will not be doing its job if it does not squarely tell the Minister that the Bill is bad precedent, bad law and wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have reasons for proposing this measure—I cannot think what they might be—which they believe are cogent, for heaven's sake, let them be listed in the Bill so that there may be no doubt. Otherwise, the clause will inexorably increase the centralised power of the Secretary of State. Of course, he will not be able to use that power without recourse to Parliament because the second half of the clause refers to affirmative orders and that means that there must automatically be debate. However, I do not have much faith in such debates, nor in consultation. I have no faith whatever in the clause as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
I see no reason for it, but if it has a legitimate purpose which none of use has been able to jalouse—that is a Hawick word for "determine"—it should be stated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the honourable Gentleman for giving way. Of course, it is possible that there would be no houses to let under the terms of clause 31 and, if that were so, there would be no need for the Committee. That is one obvious reason—I can think of others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have spent two hours discussing the fact that in rural areas there can be no applications because there are no precedents. Clause 31(3)(a) and (b) relate, effectively, to disapplication, so we have already covered that issue. I do not know the difference between termination and disapplication when there are no comparable rents, but I may have misunderstood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the fact remains that this a duff way of legislating and I take exception to a blanket power being laid in the lap of the Secretary of State with no justification that, I can see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall deal with the fundamental principle of this bizarre little clause in the clause stand part debate but I agree with every word said by the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). I, too have no faith in the fig leaf, of parliament any scrutiny that is, applied to that kind of order. It is meaningless and we and everybody else know it. It is a waste of parliamentary time that takes in no one, with the possible exception of the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Gentleman would care to check the parliamentary record of the period between 1979 and 1981 he would find that, as a result of my activities, the Government had to withdraw an order that had been tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, well—one order was withdrawn as a result of the honourable Gentleman's activities! Frankly, I doubt whether it will be of great consolation to my constituents to know that an order can be introduced in Parliament to remove the power of a rent assessment committee to take any action to alter their rents. I suppose that the logic of the statement made by the honourable Member for Tayside, North is that they should feel that everything will be all right because the great mother of Parliaments in Westminster will give due consideration to the order that there is no need to worry because the honourable Members for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) and even for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) will be there. They will be able to apply their grey matter to considering, whether a rent assessment committee should be able to determine the rents on a particular class of houses in Athelstaneford in my constituency. However, I cannot see that that makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, local authorities for the areas, at least,
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
should be consulted. We have not heard from the Minister, but I am inclined to advise my honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) to stick to his guns. He has done well in the Committee by making a number of breakthroughs and striking blows for Socialism in the face of this intransigent macho mandarin from the Scottish Office and he may land another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate and I begin by mentioning that the provision mirrors a similar power in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. The reason for it is that if the market grew so much that rent a assessment committee never made determinations which were different from market rents—it is a general power which mirrors that in the 1984 Act—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which section?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 95. In other words, if it appeared that the rent assessment committee no longer served any use ful purpose for tenants, the power would be exercised. Of course, consultation of local authorites and many other organisations would have to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said, there would have to be an affirmative resolution. My honouralbe Friend had a notable success when he forced the Government to withdraw the furniture and upholstery regulations, having drawn heavily on his extensive experience of such matters in Dundee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the power in the clause was used, my right honourable Friend and learned Friend the Secretary of State would need to give extremely careful consideration before exercising it and that would necessarily involve consulting local authorities and a wide range of other interests. Any order would have to be subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, honourable Members would have a full opportunity to discuss it to ensure that my right honourable and learned Friend was aware of all the relevant facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, it is difficult to understand the Minister. He said that, of course, there would be full consultation with district councils and other bodies. Does that mean that he accepts the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted, but I do not believe that it is necessary to write the need for consultation into statute as that would be against all precedent. Certainly, consultation would have to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but when the Minister responded to the worries expressed by the Opposition about the blanket power which the clasue would give the Secretary of State he said that it be used only when a rent assessment committee served no useful purpose. However, the Bill does not say that and the power that the clause would confer on the Secretary of State would allow him to intervene as and when he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
sees fit. The Minister has not dealt with that aspect. If the Secretary of State can intervene only in certain prescribed circumstances, the Bill should state that and not give him a blanket power to act beyond those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cited section 95 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1985 and said that it provided for a similar type of order. My honourable Friend might like to know that section 95(2) of the 1984 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order under this section may contain such transitional provisions, including provisions to avoid or mitigate hardship, as appear to the Secretary of State to be desirable."</p></blockquote>
I see no provision to encourage a future Secretary of State to mitigate hardship in connection with this provision. He would have power to introduce an order which could take a rent assessment committee out of a neighbourhood and leave the tenants of that area with no recourse for a review of their rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend makes a good point. The clause will confer a blanket power on the Secretary of State and it is no use the Minister telling the Committee that he thinks that it will be applied only in certain prescribed circumstances. The Secretary of State will have power which he may apply as and when he sees fit and it is that essential element which the Minister has not tackled. He has not said how that power can be brought under control and limited to use only in certain circumstances and not be politically abused. There is always potential for such abuse, given the Secretaries of State that Scotland has had since 1979. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment as it is not necessary to write that provision into statute. I refer the honourable Member for East Lothian to clause 49(3) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Orders or regulations under this Part may make different provision for different cases or circumstances or different areas and may contain such incidental, supplemental or transitional provisions as the Secretary of State thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that that power will hardly ever be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to abuse. When a Secretary of State, of whatever party, must present his case to both Houses of Parliament, it must stand up to the glare of the closest scrunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last remark is nonsense. The Government have imposed the poll tax on Scotland when eight out of 10 Scots have rejected it. The provisions of scrutiny of the Secretary of State's powers in the clause are not worth the paper on which they are written. There is an in-built Tory majority in the Government that will vote through any nonsense that comes into the heads of Secretaries of State for Scotland.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already discussed the principles of the clause which provides for the termination of the functions of rent assessment committees under any circumstances that enter the Secretary of State's head. I do not like giving Secretaries for Scotland that sort of power. It has been exercised wrongly by the Secretary of State for Scotland recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) will be aware of the position in Strathclyde with regard to education. The Secretary of State for Scotland is using powers in a provision drafted in the same way as the one that we are discussing to introduce orders to change primary legislation. That is a sloppy way of approaching such matters. The Government are seeking powers for future Secretaries of States for Scotland to take a short cut. Rent assessment committees will be taken out of particular categories of housing in Scotland for any reason that may enter the Secretary of State's head. There might be superficial consultation with district councils. My honourable Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), with his well-known doggedness, managed to extract the undertaking from the Minister that district councils would be consulted. We could consult until we are blue in the face, but the Government will do what they want in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) says pompously that the matter will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. Who is kidding who? We have seen statutory instruments being discussed after 10 o'clock or midnight on the Floor of the House—if we are lucky. Otherwise, they are considered in one of the Committee Rooms. There is a formal debate on the motions that the Committee has considered the statutory instrument. Members can note for or against but it does not matter too much as it will still go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no great consolation to our constituents to find that a statutory protection that gives them recourse to the rent assessment committee can be swept aside by a vote in the House of Commons in the middle of the night. A few honourable Members may have been able to debate it a little on the Floor of the House, but when the Division bells ring, honourable Members appear from all over the place. Even the honourable Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams) could vote on the matter, and those representing Scotland would be outvoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussiong a fundamental issue. We heard this morning about the establishment of short, assured tenancies and all the misery and insecurity that they will engender. Clause 31 will enable rent assessment committees to consider complaints about excessively high rents, but under clause 32, the Secretary of State can remove those rent assessment committees at the drop of a hat. We are entitled to be anxious about the implications of that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reject the Minister's proposition that there is a precedent for the clause in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Section 95 refers to release from rent regulations and subsection (1) is very specific and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State is satisfied with respect to every part of any area that the number of persons seeking to become tenants there—

	<ol>

	<li>of dwelling-houses exceeding a specified rateable value or</li>

	<li>of any class or description of dwelling-house or of dwelling-house exceeding a specified rateable value,</li></ol>
is not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling-houses in that part, he may by order provide that no such dwelling-house in the area shall be the subject of a regulated tenancy."</p></blockquote>
As the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, subsection (2) refers to transitional provisions for hardship. The Minister adverted to clause 49, which partially covers that point, but it does not cover the hardship provisions. The Minister should not glibly say that he has the authority and the entitlement to introduce clause 32. Subsection 32(1) provides as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State by order so provides, section 31 above shall not apply in such cases or to tenancies of houses in such areas or in such other circumstances as may be specified in the order."</p></blockquote>
There is a world of legal difference between subsection 32(1) and subsection 95(1) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. It is disingenious of the Minister to use the principle of section 95 of the 1984 Act, which he will realise if he thinks about if for a legal second. One could argue about generalised powers being landed in the warm lap of the Secretary of State for Scotland, but there is no comparison between the powers that accrue to him under section 95 of the 1984 Act and those of subsection 32(1) of the Bill. It is wrong for Parliament to allow the Executive to assume those powers bit by bit, willy nilly, by just slipping in extra bits of power here and there under
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
affirmative orders. It happens all the time that the power of Parliament is being taken away bit by bit by silly pieces of legislation such as the Bill. There is no justification for such lazy nonsense from the Scottish Office, who say, "We need not bother about that; we can slip in a wee clause that will give the Secretary of State the power to do what he likes." It is bad legislation and the Committee should have none of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of saying sorry.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not expect that power to be exercised for some time, it will be exercised when the supply of rented housing rises to meet demand—when the Government's policy has been seen to be successful. I do not expect my right honourable and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to make use of the power unless there is a good, convincing reason for doing so. Once the policy embodied in part II comes to fruition and supply for private renting has grown to the extent that demand is fully met, we argue that the market can be left to operate without interference. It is in those circumstances that I envisage that the power could be exercised to disapply the rent assessment committees' functions to determine rent for short assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Honourable Members have voiced discontent about the intentions behind clause 32. Their suspicions are entirely groundless. To help convince them, I draw attention to section 95 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which gives my right honourable and learned Friend the power to disapply rent regulation. Opposition Members will no doubt be interested to know on how many occasions the power in the 1984 Act has been used. Although the Act has been on the statute book for several years, it has never been exercised. There would have to be extremely good reasons for a power of that nature to be exercised.

real reason? I accept that it would have to go through both Houses. But the point is that the power can be used not only by Governments of the Minister's political party, but by Governments of any political persuasion, some of whom may not be as disinterested or self-effacing.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an even better reason. Tranent is an important town in my constituency. The honourable Gentleman could not bring in such an order under those circumstances; he would have to go through Tranent on his way from his constituency to Edinburgh and the good people and the belters of Tranent would ensure that he did not get away with it. They can be very persuasive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The thought of a Liberal Government with the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berkwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) as Secretary of State for Scotland was a flight of fancy. Nevertheless, I was provoked into thinking about a situation where the honourable Gentleman and his honourable Friends were the Government and I and the honourable Gentlemen on the Opposition Benches were the Opposition—an unholy alliance. I am sure that we could find technical reasons against such an order. It is easier to block statutory instruments that any other form of legislation. I have my eyes on another statutory instrument that may come before us soon. If the Minister responsible—not a Scottish Minister—is foolish enough to table it unamended, I assure the honourable Gentleman that I shall bring into bearing factors which will force its withdrawal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's reply on the blanket powers given to the Secretary of State for Scotland. He thought that they would be exercised only when the market had at last started working. There has been a capitalist market for 300 years and the Minister at last sees some point at which it may work and supply exceed demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that supply now technically exceeds demand? In Scotland, 130,000 houses are empty and 38,000 families are described as homeless. In that pure technical sense supply exceeds demand. But that is pure fiction. In reality 200,000 people on council housing waiting lists are not adequately housed now and 1.25 million people live in overcrowded accommodation. But in technical terms, the Minister could now argue that the market was working, that there was an excess of supply over demand and that the Secretary of State for Scotland could intervene and disapply the rent determination and the rent assessment committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense for the Minister to say that he knows in what circumstances the power will be applied, yet not be prepared to write into the legislation what
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
those circumstances are. He is asking the Committee to give the Secretary of State for Scotland a blank cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense to speak of the power of Parliament to deal with statutory instruments. If there was a guaranteed way to Back Benchers to stop statutory instruments the poll tax would not be implemented in Scotland. I shall be asking the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for advice on how to we can wreck statutory instruments on the poll tax.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was getting so excited about becoming Secretary of State for Scotland that I forgot to make my final point. Presumably some of the costs and bureaucracy of rent assessment committees will be reduced if orders are introduced to terminate their work. What would it cost to omit the clause?

On the point raised by the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) the 130,000 houses are not in the market. We wish to bring them back into the market. That is the basis of our policy. Empty houses are not part of the housing supply; they become part of that supply only when they are available for renting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked what the position would be if he were Secretary of State for Scotland. Neither he nor anyone else in that position would be able to use the power arbitarily because he would be subject to judicial review by the courts if he exceeded his powers. If the Secretary of State acted unreasonably, the matter might be defeated when debated in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister is genuine in his wish to protect tenants from harassment. He spoke of his personal experience of constituents who had been the victims of harassment and of having to refer them to the police. The clause relates to protection from
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
eviction, and no issue is more sensitive or emotive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party is keen on Victorian values, but I doubt whether the image of the landlord with the waxed moustache turning the widow and her bairns out into the snow is a Victorian value to which the Government wish to return. Although some might share such an ambition, the majority do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to pay lip service to the need to protect people from unreasonable eviction and from the harassment leading to it, but quite another properly to legislate to prevent it. The amendment is simple; it seeks to omit the word "persistently" from the measures. As it stands, the Bill leaves a loophole for harassment, which the Minister has said repeatedly that he does not wish to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) earlier raised the spectre—the Minister called it a bogie—of Rachman. It happened a long time ago and we have been told that the Government have learnt from the deregulation that occurred in the late 1950s and the burgeoning of Rachmanism. We have reached a consensus—although some choke on it more than others—that there are bad landlords. The Minister has said it repeatedly. He was generous enough to concede it again not an hour ago. Earlier, the honourable Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that he had met kindly lairds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was it? I am all too aware that many landlords cannot be described as kindly. The deregulation proposals in the Bill are likely to bring back in some cases, and into the market for the first time in others, the kind of landlords who will raise the spectre of Rachmanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause apparently seeks to protect tenants from harassment and to ensure that they should not be forced to give up their rights or their houses. However, it will apply only when a landlord
	<br><blockquote><p>"persistently withdraws or withholds services reasonably required for the occupation of the premises".</p></blockquote>
Our amendment seeks to delete the word "persistently" so that a landlord who has once withdrawn or witheld essential services, can still be held to have acted unlawfully. That is not a revolutionary demand. It may be thought that that is too pat a possibility, but I suspect not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A landlord could, on one occassion, withdraw electricity and gas from the house of an elderly tenant in the middle of winter, thereby forcing that elderly tenant to vacate the premises—in other words, evict that tenant as he or she could not possibly live in the winter without electrictiy or gas. A landlord may commit such a heinous act once, and having done so would not be acting unlawfully under this legislation. He would have to withdraw such essential services persistently before he could be caught by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shelter has been kind enough to give us the Chambers dictionary definition of "persistent"—it is "constant or constantly repeated". "Constant" is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
defined as "continual", which is further defined as "unceasing". That is not at one with the Minister's efforts to convince us that the Government have learnt their lesson from the 1950s and early 1960s. Rachman must not be permitted to reappear on the streets and stairs of the tenanted properties that will come on to the market as a result of the Bill. If the Government are genuinely determined to plug all the loopholes to guard against such harassment, I ask them to consider the deletion of "persistently". That will protect tenants who otherwise will be left at the mercy of unscrupulous and bad landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Mr. Rachman had gone only once to a door with his Alsation dogs barking at the tenant and forced the tenant out, he would not, according to the terms of the Bill, have acted illegally, for he would not have persistently taken an Alsation dog to the tenant's door. That cannot be the Government's intention. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to our reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) has spoken about a particularly important provision in the Bill, and the matter that he raised is also important. He said that "persistently" meant "constantly, repeatedly", and I shall deal with that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern that the honourable Gentleman and many other honourable Members feel about this matter is misplaced. Whether services have been withheld or withdrawn persistently is only one of two tests that can be applied under clause 33 or 35 to discover whether a landlord is liable for damages or guilty of an harassment offence. The other is that the landlord has done acts calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of the residential occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman's point was that a single act could constitute a grave abuse, and that that should be taken into account. If a single withdrawal or a series of withdrawals of a service were serious enough, they would easily qualify under that test—for example, the deliberate withdrawal of electricity or heating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second test, to which the amendments are directed, is designed as an extra safeguard in a case where the landlord withdraws a service which, on one or two occasions, could not be regarded as sufficient to drive the tenant out, but which done persistently, time after time, amounts to harassment. The amendments are unnecessary. Tenants and other residential occupiers will be well protected by the provisions in the Bill. I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government must have had in their mind that neither of the two possibilities could apply. I take back my point about Rachman appearing only once at the door with an Alsation. Clearly, that would be an act designed to force out the tenant. Perhaps that was too draconian an example, but both possibilities would not have been included in the clause if it were not felt that a landlord might be guilty not of a grievous act
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to interefere with the peace or comfort"</p></blockquote>
but one might be a withdrawal of "services reasonably required". That is a lesser offence than committing an act
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort"</p></blockquote>
of the occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill includes two levels of harassment of which a landlord could be guilty. The only difference between us and the Government on the second, less serious level is that the Bill requires that the withdrawal or withholding of services must be persistent. Why not leave it open to the courts to make a judgment on even a single act of withdrawal or withholding of services? The Government are keen to convince us they are determined to protect tenants from unkindly landlords. Why not give them that added protection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is minimal and unnecessary—which was the thrust of the Minister's remarks—it would cost the Government little to accept it. It would send a signal to the racketeers who may be waiting for the passage of this legislation before getting into the housing market. It would certainly send a message to the racketeers' potential victims that the Government genuinely care as much as they claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the honourable Gentleman said about an owner with an Alsation who appears at the door and physically threatens the tenant. That would be covered under subsection (2)(a), which deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"attempts unlawfully to deprive the residential occupier of any premises of his occupation of the whole or part of the premises".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, that would not be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of the word "persistently" was deliberate to cover cases of harassment where a landlord perpetrates acts which, individually would not be regarded as serious but, cumulatively, could force a tenant out of a home. That is an important safeguard for tenants, and I hope that the honourable Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not given me much to justify withdrawing the amendment. I am looking anxiously at my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) for a lead. Nothing in what the Minister said has given me any comfort, so I am extremely reluctant to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister identified the crucial point. Individual acts of harassment may be petty and would not satisfy the test of subsection (2)(a) as acts
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to interfere with peace or comfort"</p></blockquote>
but which are none the less tantamount to an attempt to edge a tenant out of a property. The committing of one such petty act of harassment should be open to prosecution. The courts should judge whether it was an attempt to remove that tenant. If the tears shed over harassment of tenants during the past few weeks are to mean anything, if they are to be other than crocodile tears, the Minister should agree to drop the little word "persistently". It would send the right message to potential victims and potential aggressors.

	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
At this 11th hour, having already asked the Minister three times, I beg him to reconsider this matter. If not, we shall have to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the honourable Gentleman wishes to divide the Committee. All serious cases of physical threat will be caught under subsection (2)(a). The problem is that a single act may be relatively unimportant on its own, but taken cumulatively could constitute harassment. There is a fine line between what does and what does not constitute harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Gentleman has a clear idea in his mind—and so do I—of what would be a definite case of harassment—the man with the Alsatian at the door, the physical threat. There is no problem about such a case; the facts are established and it is straightforward. What is less clear is an act of negligence or forgetfulness. That, on its own, may not constitute harassment, but if it happened more than once it would be construed under subsection (2)(b) as harassment, even if it were not deliberate. It is a matter of finely balanced judgment and the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question put and negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 448, in page 19, line 19, after "residence" add
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) obtains an order for possession of a house in such circumstances as are specified in Schedule 5 to this Act, and it is subsequently made to appear to the court that the order was obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of material facts.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the tenant who loses his home after the landlord has dishonestly obtained possession of the house will be entitled to damages. If a landlord has obtained a possession order by giving false information or by withholding information from the court, he is not entitled to that order. Therefore, technically he has unlawfully evicted the tenant. The amendment seeks to ensure that a tenant so evicted has the same right as any other unlawfully evicted tenant to seek damages under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, in a debate on ground 8 of schedule 5, the Minister said that if a landlord obtained possession after giving certain assurances and then did not do what he had said he would do, the tenant would be entitled to claim damages. The amendment seeks to write that into statute. All the amendments to which I have already spoken are reasonable, and amendment No. 448 is no different. It seeks to give powers of protection to tenants. The Minister has said repeatedly that he has the interests of tenants at heart. We have not seen much evidence of that so far, but if he accepts the amendment he might prove otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamiltion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the honourable Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram). There are such rights already under common law. Naturally, he is right to deprecate landlords who use dishonest means to gain possession of a house. I understnd what has inspired
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
the amendment, but I do not believe that it is necessary. Under common law, tenants in such circumstances—the victims—can take action if they discover that a possession order was granted against them under false pretences. They would have a good case for damages against their former landlords. A special provision added to the Bill to that effect would not be of any practical benefit to such tenants.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that, under section 21 of the Rent Act 1984 dealing with protected tenancies, former tenants have the right to seek compensation for misrepresentation or concealment of material facts in certain circumstances?

	<p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has taken us a little further. He referred to the dishonest attempts by a landlord to gain possession of a house under schedule 5. However, I fear that our debate exposes the fundamental dishonesty of the Government in introducing such a provision at all. There will be no need for people to seek to gain possession by unlawful means as there will be a long list of lawful ways by which they can secure possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) raised a disturbing point. He said that it would be even easier than it should be for landlords to get away with exploiting the terms of schedule 5. The tenant affected by the abuse of the powers in that provision might not be able to obtain damages under the circumstances that my honourable Friend described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
The Government are taking the credit for bringing in new protections against unlawful eviction, and are saying a great deal about the possibility of damages for harassment. Conservative Members are going around Scotland saying that the Government are creating wonderful new tenants' rights. However, we have already debated a number of clauses and schedules that establish brand new rights for different types of legalised harassment, pushing up rents and so on, and new grounds for eviction that will make it easier for tenants and their families to be put out on the street. I am not very impressed by the Government's words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my honourable Friend the Minister becomes too pliant in the face of the amendment, I trust that he will ponder on the appalling concept of once it had been established under statute that a person was in breach of his contract, he could at any time in the future obtain legal aid to bring an action to challenge the finding of the court, alleging that something said during the proceedings was untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that right were to be implicit in the law of Scotland, there would be no end to litigation, criminal and civil, in every area. Let us not forget that there many tenants may leave a building and afterwards allege that they did not do so willingly. In order to get damages, they will say, "Well, he left his dog in the house; sold the doormat; did something that upset my children; parked his car outside at night or revved it up when he was leaving and woke the baby." All those pleas would be made on legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not forget that wickedness in the human mind is not restricted to one party. It would be dangerous to introduce into the law of Scotland the concept that years later someone could challenge a court finding by trying to establish that a lie had been told during the proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a landlord dishonestly obtains a possession order by misrepresentation or concealment of the facts, the tenant could be regarded as having been illegally evicted. Furthermore, in such circumstances, the tenant would have a case for damages against the landlord anyway, so no special statutory provision would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross raised carries considerable weight. The common law is effective in dealing with cases like this, and to write specific rights for damages into statute is dangerous and casts doubt on more general rights under the common law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the honourable Member for East Kilbride will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 456, in page 19, leave outlines 37 to 44 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The sheriff may, at the request of the former residential occupier, make an order as a result of which the former residential
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
occupier is reinstated in the premises in question in such circuumstances that he becomes again the residential occupier of them".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with clause 33(6), which introduces a supposedly new provision to protect tenants against the evil of unlawful eviction in Scotland. The subsection means that a landlord who had unlawfully evicted his tenant would not be liable to pay damages if he had let the tenant back into the house before the proceedings began. It makes it possible for the former, or wrongfully evicted tenant to make application to the sheriff for an order to reinstate him in the house from which he was evicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to insert a new subsection to replace subsection (6). Our amendment would retain the right of a former tenant to request the sheriff to make an order that he be reinstated in his house, and also allow him to claim damages for the loss of the right to occupy the house. In addition, it would allow a tenant who had been reinstated in his house before proceedings began to claim damages for the loss of the right to occupy the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome paragraph (b) of subsection (6). It enables tenants who have been wrongfully evicted to seek an order from the sheriff court to get back into the house. That paragraph embodies an important principle. However, we should like to take it further so that the tenant could get damages because he had been temporarily put out of his house unlawfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our anxiety is that some landlords might try it on and attempt to get away with evicting a tenant unlawfuly in the hope that he would not take recourse in the law. When the landlord discovers that the tenant intends to go to the court to get redress, he may immediately reinstate the tenant and hope to get away scot free. A landlord might be encouraged to indulge in such tactics. We believe that the tenant should be able to go to court to seek reinstatement, but that the landlord should not get away with trying, unlawfully, to evict his tenant. In some cases, the tenant would have been evicted but then told that he could return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords should be liable to pay damages for such abuses, and I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 456 would mean that a residential occupier who had been driven out of his home could both obtain a court order to reinstate him and claim damages for alleged eviction from his lanlord. The right to damages provided by clause 33 is intended as compensation for residential occupiers who have lost their homes. It would be wrong for such an occupier to have the right both to a court order reinstating him and to damages for being illegally evicted. If he were reinstated, he would no longer be without his home, and therefore he should not be eligible for the damages provided for in clause 33, I hope that the committee will not support this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my honourable and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross like to intervene? No? I understand that the tenant would still have to claim for solatium, and he would still have a claim under clause 33(5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the honourable and learned Member for Perth and Kinross was getting to his feet. We can always do with his advice and experience in these questions. What about cases where the lanlord is simply trying it on, and seeks to evict a tenant unlawfully hoping that the tenant is not aware of his rights under the provision, and reinstates the tenant only when he realises that legal action is being initiated? Surely it should be possible to discourage, and indeed penalise, landlords who abuse the spirit of the law in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be nothing to prevent a tenant claiming damages under common law if he had been harassed in that way, and had suffered a loss as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to intervene briefly, Mr. Lambie, but trying to intervene on the verbal outpouring of the honourable Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is like trying to whistle between the spurts of a popgun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I wanted to say is that my honourable Friend is right. Anyway, if the landlord merely had a change of heart and decided not to occupy a house that he was entitled to respossess as his principal residence, that would not give rise to damages; it would just be very lucky for the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has suggested that under those circumstances the tenant could still obtain damages under common law. What therefore does the clause add to the present law? I suspect that it will emerge as a piece of window dressing by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the matter further consideration, and raise other aspects, perhaps, on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis that the Minister said that a tenant in the circumstances I have described will still have an opportunity to secure damages from his landlord under common law, I may withdraw the amendment, but I think that the Minister has something further to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robetson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I am worried about those who have lost their homes temporarily, suffering considerable hardship, costs and aggravation. Is there not a case for specific provision, first, to compensate those who are evicted, and, secondly, to penalise landlords who so conduct their affairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the position would be covered by common law. For example, if someone was out of a house temporarily and then reinstalled, it would turn on the facts and circumstances of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—[Mr. Michael J. Martin 
	<i>in the Chair.]</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate, but the honourable Gentleman asked a relevant question about the circumstances covered by the statutory right and those covered by common law in regard to damages for unlawful eviction. The clause gives a statutory right to damages where a tenant gives up the property due to the actions of the landlord set out in the clause. The right arises only where the tenant loses possession of the property. If he does not lose possession, or is reinstated, the right does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, subsection (5) preserves the tenant's common law right to sue the landlord for damages for any loss he may have substained from the breach of contract under the lease. The clause gives a right to damages if the tenant has been harassed into giving up the premises, whereas under the right in common law the tenant would have to prove that there had been a breach of the contract, that he had suffered loss as a consequence, and the extent of that loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is havering again. He would have done just as well to leave us with the initial common law protection. The purpose of clause 33 is not clear if it takes us no further than the common law protection that already exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisified. We want proper protection against unlawful eviction. That is what the clause is supposed to deal with, but the Minster has merely confirmed that a person who has been unlawfully evicted may, with luck, get his house back but will get no compensation for the harassment he has suffered over and above that he would have received under common law. As we are making no headway at all, I shall withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, I confirm that compensation for residential occupiers will be given to those who have lost their homes, so clause 33 is an extension of the rights to damages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not talking about that at this stage—we are discussing those who have lost their homes temporarily. That would be an unsettling experience for any family. There is no prospect of additional compensation or an additional penalty being imposed on the landlord in such circumstances, so I am not impressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member --> Government seek to enact legislation that will lead to many more evictions in Scotland. It is designed to create more hardship to tenants and encourage private landlords. It is hypocrisy, to put it generously, for the Government to include in this legislation this quaint little clause that purports to improve the protection for tenants. It does not make sense and it is dishonest.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 459, in page 20, line 27, leave out from "is" to end of line 35 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) the difference in value, determined as at the time immediately before the residential occupier ceased to occupy the premises in question as his residence, between the value of the landlord's interest determined on the assumption that the residential occupier continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as before that time and the value of the landlord's interest determined on the assumption that the residential occupier has ceased to have that right; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) the additional expense incurred by the residential occupier which would not have arisen had such residential occupier not been deprived of his occupation of the whole part of the premises.".</p></blockquote>
As I am not a landlord or a tenant and certainly not a lawyer. I shall not wax eloquent on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment concerns fairness, which is becoming more and more stark as we go through the Bill. It has been said that if the legislation is not to be regarded as a landlord's charter, the Government must try harder to convince people that they accept the logic of the consenses that we arrived at before you joined us, Mr. Martin—that there are bad landlords who sometime do bad things. The amendment deals with the unfair exclusion of an occupier who returns to his premises. If the occupier has incurred additional expense as a result of that temporary eviction, it is fair that they should be reimbursed. If not, the suspicion will gain ground, if it has not already done so, that the Government are bending over backwards to suit the interests of landlords and pay only lip service to the issue of fairness for tenants, even though much of the legislation is predicated on a bogus commitment to tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have dined well and have had a rethink. I may get a surprise if he accepts my amendment: perhaps he is in a convivial mood. If he does not, I may ask my honourable Friends to press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) I stress that clause 33 gives an illegally-evicted tenant an additional right to damages. He will also retain his present rights, including his right to any damages to which he may be entitled. The only qualification is that he may not use the new right and any other right he may have to obtain double damages in respect of the same loss he has suffered. Even if the tenant can pursue damages for the same loss in two different ways—using the new right or an existing one—he can choose which is more likely to benefit him most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 459 is not necessary. Given the choice available to the tenant, and extended by the new right we are introducing, he should be able to receive adequate compensation for any loss he suffers. Any landlord who evicts a tenant illegally will not benefit financially from his action. I therefore hope the amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that answer was as clear as my exposition, which was not very clear. But I have an excuse; I am not the Under-Secretary of State responsible for housing in Scotland, nor am I a lawyer or a landlord. The Minister is all three—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry. I meant to say that his family were landlords. I have a great affection for the Minister and I did not mean to hurt his feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have stated that no landlord will benefit financially through the illegal eviction of a tenant, but the amendment seeks to ensure that no one who is illegally evicted will be a brass farthing out of pocket by having been so evicted. That is different from the Minister's assurance; it does not necessarily follow that the corollary is true. The best way of ensuring that it will be true would be to accept the amendment. The Minister has not explained why the Government will not accept it, and I need to know before I can consider asking leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway), I am a landlord. I do not seek to conceal it, and I am certainly not a lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise the matter of a tenant's choice between seeking damages under this provision or under common law. Presumably that decision will not be taken by a tenant, who would find it difficult to understand the Bill, never mind common law. The choice will have to be made on legal advice and tenants would, I assume, qualify for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland said that part II of the Bill would be a fruitful source of litigation and I should like the Minister's comments on that statement. Can the Minister give us examples of circumstances in which a tenant will be better off as a result of the Bill than he or she would be under common law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, all common law rights remain in tact in that connection. The honourable Member for Glasgow, Hillhead said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
that he did not want tenants to lose in the process. As I said, I am satisfied that the new rights to damages will effectively deter landlords from seeking to evict illegally. Indeed, the extent to which the deterrence is effective will determine the extent to which legal claims arise. At the same time, illegally evicted tenants will be compensated handsomely for their loss, thus the amendment is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 463, in page 21, leave out lines 4 and 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to the bad landlord who might attempt to evict his or her tenants illegally or to harass them. The consequence of such action is that he will be liable to pay tenants in respect of their loss of the right to occupy the premises in question. Damage is assessed on the basis set out in clause 34. Subsection 2 sets out the assumptions on which the assessment of damages to be paid to the tenant will be based. In subsection (2)(c), the assumption is that the premises do not have any development value. That is explained in the notes of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment questions whether that is fair. When replying to my honourable Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) during our previous debate, the Minister assured him that no landlord would benefit financially from an illegal act. That will be tested in the Minister's reply to the amendment, because it covers the circumstances under which landlords will be able to benefit financially from illegal action, such as harassment or illegal eviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fair assessment of the landlord's interest is made in determining the measure of damages. That is important. To assume that it is unlawful to carry out any development when making a valuation may lead to a figure that is lower than the true valuation of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an obscure point because major developments are taking place throughout Scotland. There has been a mushrooming of retail parks and superstores, usually on the outskirts of cities, and of huge leisure and retail developments, such as that on the Dundee waterfront. It is important to get the provision right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When property is located in a development site, unlawful eviction is likely because landlords may wish to realise the profits that become available when property is situated on development sites. A landlord may calculate that it will be in his interests to evict a tenant unlawfully because the profit available from sale of the property to a developer will be higher than any damages that may be awarded to the tenant. The landlord may benefit by evicting a tenant even if damages are incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
If the Minister was serious in what he said to my honourable Friend the Member for Hillhead, he should do something about the matter. The amendment is not aimed at the amount of damages to be awarded; its purpose is to ensure that landlords do not unlawfully evict, safe in the knowledge that the damages that he may have to pay will not be based on his true profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was suggested by Shelter, who have made a strong case. They have described circumstances in which landlords may make money by committing an illegal act. The Government must close the loophole and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) referred to the amount of damages to which a landlord who illegally evicts will be liable. The honourable Gentleman argued that the damages should be as large as possible. The aim of clauses 33 and 34 is to act as a deterrent to illegal eviction. That is why the amount of damages will be the full difference between the value of the house with a sitting tenant and its value with vacant possession. The intention is to ensure that any profit that the landlord may make by evicting a tenant will be wiped out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of potential development value is more difficult. The increase in value of premises because of possible development is independent of whether there is a sitting tenant. The increase in value if a tenant is illegally evicted is a gain to which the landlord should not be entitled, but any increase due to the potential development of the property legitimately belongs to the landlord who owns the property. I am confident that the measures in clauses 33 and 34 are sufficient to deter illegal eviction—to go further would not be justifiable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an appalling reply. It exposes the clause and associated provisions in the Bill and shows what a fraud they are. If the Government earnestly wanted to penalise bad landlords for harassing tenants and for seeking to evict tenants unlawfully to make a financial gain, the Government should introduce legislative provisions with puntive damages to penalise bad landlords effectivley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has confirmed that it will still be possible for a landlord to make substantial development gains as a direct consequence of illegal eviction of tenants. I am disappointed, as I was ready to welcome the clauses as I thought that they were a major step forward. I accept that they take us marginally further forward, but it is a paper exercise. The Minister has confirmed that landlords who harass and evict their tenants unlawfully, when they are able to make a significant development gain out of a change of use of the property or by selling it on the open, will be able to get away with it with only a marginal penalty. That is intolerable. I do not know how the Minister can claim credit for advancing the case for tenants' security and for seeking to prevent the abuse of tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was indeed appalling. He said that the compensation or damages
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
that a tenant is likely to receive will be the full difference between the value of a house with the tenant and the value of the house with vacant possession. That will be only a couple of thousand pounds. A landlord could gain £100,000 on the development value of such a property. It would be in the landlord's interest to harass and evict that tenant. He will make a huge financial gain from so doing. The Minister seems to think that that is fair, because it is the landlord's property and he has the right to develop that property. It is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is aware of the development fever in Scotland. Old residential properties have been taken over by developers and demolised. It is big business. The Minister says that tenants are to have no protection. The landlord can take along his Alsation dogs, as my honourable Friend the Member for Hillhead said kick out the tenant and make £100,000 from the sale of the house. The Minister says that that is fair and legitimate and that it is in the landlord's interest to do so. The Minister should think again. The astmosphere in Committee will change dramatically if the Minister persists in holding out against the amendment. It is totally reasonably amendment and all Committee Member's support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear that in addition to the new right to damages, we are also introducing a new offence, to which a landlord, who illegally evicts, will be liable.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it will not be wiped out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree that illegal eviction must be made so unattractive that no landlord is tempted to undertake it. However, the amendment goes too far to the extent that it cannot be properly justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be making headway. My honourable Friend the Member for Hillhead has done well up to now. The Minister says that the amendment goes too far. I do not agree, but as he says that it does too far, I wonder whether he implies that the clause is deficient. He must accept that there is no effective deterrent against a landlord in such circumstances. Someone who owns property with development potential in the centre of one of our great cities and who has a number of tenants in that property, may see a risk in having to pay moderate damages to tenants whom he evicts unlawfully, but may coolly calculate that the risk is worth taking, because he will still make a large sum of money. We had hoped that the Minister not only wanted to compensate the tenant, but also wanted to deter landlords who are playing that sort of game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister seems to have no intention of imposing punitive damages on a landlord involved in that sort of monstrous activity. When the Minister said that my honourable Friend's amendment went too far, he implied that there was
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
room for improvement. Would he like to look at this matter with the others that he will look at before Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galloway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely this flies in the face of the assurance given to me by the Minister after amendment No. 459. The Minister said that no landlord guilty of an illegal eviction would stand to gain financially, but if he resists the amendment and fails to come up with another suggestion which may not go as far as the amendment, but at least deals with the issue—as pointed out by my honourable Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson)—the Minister's assurance is hollow and not worth a dime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is resisted, the way is clearly open for landlords owning property on plum sites for development to bag the tenant, stump up a couple of grand damages, and coolly pocket hundreds of thousands of pounds, which on some sites may be millions of pounds. Unless some progress is made on the matter, the Minister's answer to amendment No. 459 will have misled the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) is correct. It may well be 9.30 p.m. now, but we have identified a fundamentally important issue. It would be scandalous if the Minister finds no way to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is a deplorable position for any Government to take. The Minister may not be able to understand this simple matter, but his colleagues on the Front Bench who understand it should advise him to back down.

give tenants compensation for what they have suffered and to deter landlords from abusing their position. I am not opposed to the clause—I do not think that anyone would oppose it—but it does not take tenant protection any further forward. The principle of the clause is sound enough—payment of damages in the sort of circumstances that we have discussed—but it is dishonest for the Government to say that they are creating a new offence from which landlords will be deterred by damages and court proceedings. The clause simply embroiders on existing common law provisions. There will be no effective deterrent against bad landlord practices and tenants will be no better off. The clause does not do any harm, but I should not like any one in Scotland to get the impression that the legislation does any great favours to tenants or takes any effective action against bad landlord practices. The clause is purely a cosmetic exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The deterrent is not only that the landlord must pay compensation but also that he would be guilty of an offence for which he will be liable for a fine up to the statutory maximum or to imprisonment.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is six

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pathetic to think that a £2,000 will deter landlords from illegally evicting tenants when they could gain up to £100,000 from such eviction. The Minister said that six months imprisonment is a deterrent, but the penalty is a fine or imprisonment, not both. In any case, the landlord may not be the one who turns up on the doorstep with the alsation, so it may still be in his interests to evict tenants illegally. The Minister is making a complete sham of the Government's case that in return for tipping the balance between the landlord and the tenant decisivley in favour of the landlord, in compensation, tenants should be given complete protection from harassment and illegal eviction. That protection is an utter sham when we consider the conditions under which clause 34 will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is setting up illegal circumstances in which landlords will have an incentive illegally to evict tenants in order to make money from the development potential of properties. The Minister refuses to consider that central issue. He says that the Government did not want to make illegal eviction attractive, but they are doing so by refusing to accept our amendments. Clause 34 is rendered meaningless by the Government's intransigence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the honourable Gentlemant to section 22(3) of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 which states:

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 275, in page 21, line 18, leave out from beginning to first "that" in line 19 and insert

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background to the amendment is the Government's claim that the clause is intended to strengthen the laws on harassment and illegal eviction of tenants. It is arguable whether that is an advance, given that the other clauses in the Bill make it easy and attractive for landlords to evict tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>867</span>
Under existing legislation, it is an offence for a landlord or his heavies to harass tenants. I could understand and the clause if the existing legislation made it difficult to prove the test of intent in court. The Government say that clause 35 will be a more useable test and it states that it will be an offence to harass a tenant if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe"</p></blockquote>
that his action is likely to force the tenant out. I welcome attempts to strengthen existing laws on harassment or illegal eviction, but I am not convinced that the clause is the best way of doing that. The amendment seeks to remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (in either case) he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe".</p></blockquote>
The court should not be asked to assess a landlord's intentions when he harasses or illegally evicts a tentant. It should apply the usual test of reasonableness to the actions of the landlord. That is why the words which would be inserted are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in circumstances such that the court is reasonably satisfied".</p></blockquote>
I accept that the Minister is trying to strengthen the laws on illegal eviction and harassment here. But if he accepted the amendment which has been suggested by Renfrew district council it would further strengthen the law and make it easier for the court to crack down on harassment and illegal evictions. It is much more difficult for a court to assess whether the landlord knew or had reasonable cause to believe that his actions would result in harassment than to apply the usual test of reasonableness. There are many clever lawyers on this Committee and they would have a field day defending clients who said that they did not know or had no reason to believe that their actions would result in harassment or illegal eviction. It may seem a slight amendment but it will strengthen the law against the landlords. I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the honourable Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that having reasonable cause to believe would almost certainly be established in court if the tenant had simply told the landlord that his conduct was liable to cause him to leave. It is common ground between the honourable Member and us that harassment is an evil which ought to be rooted out. Clause 35 is our attempt to make it easier to prove that an offence of harassment has occurred by introducing a new test of whether the landlord knew or had reason to believe that his conduct was likely to lead to the occupier quitting the premises. We believe that it will in practice be easier to prove than the existing test of whether the landlord intended to force the occupier to leave. Intentions are notoriously difficult to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that amendment No. 275 represents a different approach to make it easier to prove harassment. While I will always consider any proposals to make the law against harassment more effective, I do not think the amendment would be as helpful as leaving clause 35 as drafted. We are of course leaving the existing provision in place: the new offence is additional. The sheriff will have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
series of tests which he can apply to determine whether harassment has occurred. We believe it better to provide specific tests than to have a vaguer requirement as the amendment proposes. I hope the honourable Member will not press his amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the wording in clause:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe"</p></blockquote>
will be the only test which the courts will be asked to apply in the case of harassment? Will it be in addition to the existing powers of the sheriff to judge whether the actions of the landlord are reasonable? Will the sheriff still have the choice or will it be one or the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be in addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again we welcome the pious objective of the clause. The Minister was talking about rooting out evil. As a Committee we would be deluding ourselves if we came away with the impression that clause 35 will root out the evil of harassment of tenants by landlords. As I have already said, other parts of the Bill create a far greater evil by promoting insecurity among tenants. However, as far as it goes, the clause seems unexceptionable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause introduces the second of our proposals to tighten up the protection of tenants against harassment. A new offence created by the clause should be easier to prove than the existing one in the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. On that basis I am sure that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 476, in page 22, line 26, at end insert—

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask for some clarification before I move to the substance of the amendment, which is fairly clear. However, perhaps it would be easier if I stated the purpose of the amendment and then asked for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to extend the protection against unlawful evictions and harassment of residential occupiers to cover former part VII contract occupiers. Under the Bill residential occupiers would have no protection from summary ejection by the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask some preliminary questions. I ask them in all innocence, as I do not know the answers. First, the first line of the proposed clause 23A(2), as set out in clause 37, makes no sense. I think that it should read "In subsection (a) above", rather than "In subsection (2) above. It is possibly a typographical error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wish to query the definition of part VII properties. They are defined in section 64 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which refers to rateable values. If a property has a rateable value of less than £200 at April 1978 prices, it is excluded—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the honourable Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth) wishes to indulge in prolonged conversation, he should do outside the Committee Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my rhetoric is not captivating the attention of all Conservative Members, but it does not surprise me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part VII properties are defined in section 64 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which referes to rateable values. After the abolition of domestic rates, how will part VII subjects be defined? That is important to the background of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly 24 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 delays with special provision for agricultural employees under section 17 of the Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Act 1949. I and some other members of the Committee have a special constituency of clause 37 to section 24 of the 1984 Act. Perhaps I missed something in clause 36, but I do not see how section 24 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 is affected by clause 37. If I have missed it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So have I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that confirmation. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify those outstanding matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the substance of the amendment. It aims to extend much-needed protection. There is evidence of cases of unlawful eviction and harassment, especially of residential occupiers. They are in a very difficult situation, living cheek by jowl with the landlords in former part VII contract tenancies. As the Bill stands, residential occupiers will have no protection from summary ejection by the landlord. That is not satisfactory, and I hope that the Minister will reassure us about these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that this is an important issue. Under the existing legislation, tenants who have resident landlords are protected from illegal eviction and harassment. The clause seems to remove that protection. The Minister will have to make a very strong case for removing the existing protection, because I see no grounds for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister examine the proposed new section 23A(1)(a) closely? It refers to the occupier having
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of any accommodation in common with the owner or a member of his family".</p></blockquote>
Surely that is a very wide description. Whole families can be involved in exploiting tenants. The provision should be tightened to cover just the owner, and not other members of his family who happen to be resident in the house, thereby excluding the tenants from the existing protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister concede that tenants with resident landlords are currently protected and that the clause will remove that protection? Why do the Government believe it necessary or justifiable to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I will explain the case for the clause in relation to the amendment which seeks to provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"that there are at not time more than two occupiers in addition to the owner of his family."</p></blockquote>
One of the aims of the legislation is to encourage more people to let empty rooms in their houses. That is a simple and straightforward way of increasing the supply of accommodation, particiularly for single people. One factor which deters people from letting their empty rooms is the fear that they will not be able to evict an unsatisfactory tenant easily. The wish to be able to do so is understandable when someone is offering to share the house. I therefore cannot accept that there should be no exemption for genuine resident landlords from the need to obtain a court order to evict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I accept that there is an apparent anomaly in that certain occupiers with assured tenancies appear to be excluded from the protection of Part III of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 by the inclusion in clause 37 of the reference to members of the landlord's family. I am grateful to Shelter for having brought this to my attention, and will be considering how to deal with it. My inclination is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1987-1988V011P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>871</span>
restrict the exclusion to occupiers with resident landlords who also share accommodation with the landlord or one of his family, but I should like to give the matter some further consideration.
