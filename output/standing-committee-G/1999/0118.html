	<div class='page-header'><h1>Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move That, during proceedings on the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank you, Mrs. Michie. I begin by welcoming you. You are well-known on all sides of the House as fair and firm and we are looking forward to you chairing our proceedings with a great deal of humour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the liberty of looking you up in Roth's "Parliamentary Profiles", which describes you as "a strong-minded local advocate", which we shall certainly need in these proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking forward to an interesting discussion. It is a great privilege to be a member of this Committee. When I entered the House in 1992, I had the pleasure of being a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs which discussed the funding of political parties and contributing to its minority report. It is a great pleasure to take part in these proceedings. We look forward too to welcoming your co-Chairman, Mr. Maxton, who is also well-known to all non-Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is based on the report of the Neill committee, an independent body charged with giving authoritative advice to Government and Parliament alike. It was clear on Second Reading that the work of Lord Neill and his colleagues commands widespread respect in the House and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to say only a few words at this stage. In 14 months the House has had three opportunities to discuss the central issues of the Bill—the funding of political parties and the conduct of elections and referendums. The first occasion was in November 1998, shortly after the publication of the Neill committee report, when there was a full day's debate on it in the House. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement on Second Reading to coincide with the publication of the Government's White Paper and draft Bill. Earlier this month the Bill was debated on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from those proceedings, especially the discussion on Second Reading, that there is all-party support for the package of measures recommended by the Neill committee, which are to be given effect by the Bill. It is the Government's wish, as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made clear, that the Bill in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
its final form should have a political consensus behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it interesting that, during the Second Reading debate the discussion on political parties, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary remarked that it was odd that throughout the history of Parliament there had been so little discussion of the vital role of political parties. We recognise that the Committee has to listen and respond, to take the Bill forward rather than impose it. That is what we want to do. Certainly, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I and all our colleagues will try to ensure that we have the best possible discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have already indicated some of the matters that they want to address. I know, Mrs. Michie, that we shall have an interesting discussion that will take our public life forward. I look forward very much to our debates and I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I echo the welcome given to you, Mrs. Michie, by the Minister of State and say that we look forward to your chairmanship and that of Mr. Maxton? I too do not want to spend a long time in speaking to this motion other than to welcome the introduction of the Minister of State and to say that my colleagues will be seeking to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we made clear on Second Reading, we welcome legislation to implement the Neill Report and we support the basic principles of this Bill, although we will oppose clauses where the Government have deviated either from the letter or the spirit of Neill and seek to improve where we feel appropriate. We are particularly concerned about definitions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading we made it clear that we felt that this was a constitutional Bill and should, quite rightly, be taken on the Floor of the House at least in part, so we welcome last night's motion in the House. After discussions through the usual channels, the Committee has been discharged in respect of parts I and VII of the Bill. The clauses dealing with the creation of the Electoral Commission and the funding of referendums will be debated on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work of the Committee can now concentrate on matters relating to donations and spending in election campaigns. There are many parts and many clauses for us to get our teeth into, not least the sections on registration, accounting, donations, campaign expenditure, third-party expenditure, candidates' expenditure, the whole new section on companies, and the final section on overseas voters and enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, all those parts hang on part I, which deals with the establishment of the Electoral Commission, a constitutional novelty that not only replaces the various boundary commissions, but takes on many of the functions previously exercised by the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
State as well as many new functions. It will be difficult for the Committee to deal with subsequent parts of the Bill until part I has been disposed of, but I note that the motion will probably lead us to begin consideration of the subsequent parts of the Bill as early as Thursday of this week, which means that we shall be suffering from that constraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will assure us that the Electoral Commission clauses taken on the Floor of the House will not deviate substantially from those contained in the Bill that we have before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Stunell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hazel Grove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a relative newcomer to the House, it is good to have a Chairman who is announced as being firmly fair and possibly friendly on occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat party welcomes the Bill. In many respects it is an overdue and necessary regulation of our democratic processes. During the Committee stage we shall seek to clarify some points of detail and practicality that have not entirely been taken account of in the Bill. There are some areas where we believe that clarity is needed and others that need tightening up. At the end of this we should have a better and fairer democratic procedure for Parliament and for all of our electoral processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken note of the split of the Bill. I agree with the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) that it creates some procedural difficulty in respect of the Electoral Commission and its impact on the subsequent work of the Committee. Nevertheless, I hope that we can make constructive progress that results in a Bill that is a credit to the House and to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been my experience during my limited time in the House that the effectiveness of discussion and the quality of outcome does not benefit significantly from debate on the Floor of the House compared with debate in committee. I hope that the quality of the debate in the House will at least match that in this Committee and that, therefore, the outcome will be satisfactory. That is, perhaps, a discussion for another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said that she was looking for dialogue and consensus. We certainly welcome that statement. Successful legislation is that to which the broad body of political opinion is happy and willing to consent, otherwise there will be difficulties in future. I hope that it will not leave the Minister of State's mind at any point during the debate that we are looking for a broad-front approach to the Bill, which appears to be the most substantial overhaul of our electoral procedures since 1883. It is long overdue and much needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Linton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not add much to what has already been said except that it will be a pleasure for us all to serve on such a well-crafted and well-drafted Bill. To emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell), it will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
be the first complete overhaul of campaign spending legislation since 1883. For the first time ever Parliament will be looking at party funding, so we are in the unusual position of legislating on a blank piece of paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Party funding legislation in other countries is normally revised from time to time to take account of possible evasion, in much the same way as tax legislation. We all know that Governments often have a pressing agenda and Oppositions have the irritating habit of opposing what they do. We have a precious opportunity with consensus between all parties on the need for this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State served on the Home Affairs Committee where my party formed the basic views contained in the Bill back in 1994. Since the new Leader of the Opposition took over in 1997, the Conservative party has also committed itself to these principles. We have a window of opportunity where there is agreement on the main lines of the Bill among all the parties and that puts an additional onus on us to make sure that we get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a simple loophole in the 1883 Bill. It said that the candidate or his agent should be subject to controls, but it forgot about the party. If that loophole had been plugged then, much trouble since would have been saved. I hope that we spot and plug similar loopholes in the Bill and I shall try to speak on one or two areas where there may be unintended danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example relates to overseas voters. I have received representations from the Labour International branch in Rome and the British Conservative Association in Switzerland about the impact of clause 130 and proposals for a form of continuous registration. Another is clause 63 on Northern Ireland, which is well crafted for the problems in Northern Ireland, but is in danger of opening up a loophole that could be used by completely different sets of people to evade the main purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another is clause 72, which deals with the national spending limit and is a cental part of the Bill. However, I fear the experience of Canada has shown that however one defines an election expense, there will always be a good deal of slippage and many resourceful party treasurers who can argue that certain items are not election expenditure when they clearly are. It will be necessary either to put more safeguards into the definitions or to have a lower limit to take account of the ability of party officials to inflate the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, clause 48 deals with limits on donations. The main purpose of the Bill is to avoid going back to political parties relying on single, seven-figure donations from individual people. That will be frustrated unless we introduce some limit in what individuals may give. It would strengthen the Bill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
enormously if we could introduce such a limit, not on corporate, trade union or party donations, but simply on individual donations, to make sure that the main thrust of the Bill—to control party spending and to create a level political playing field—is delivered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in welcoming you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. I shall keep my remarks extremely brief. I look forward to serving on this Standing Committee. I hope that the Minister will accept that as this is a measure which commands a great deal of cross-party support on many issues, it is the intention of the Opposition to be as constructive as possible, and also to make sure that the matter is dealt with reasonably expeditiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I may be forgiven if I cast a single discordant note at the start and express some slight surprise that we shall sit for the first time to consider substantive issues on Thursday. I was not aware of that until I arrived today. One of the features of the Bill, as the Minister will be aware, is that because of negotiations through the usual channels, until last night there was a lack of complete parity as to which parts would be taken on the Floor of the House and which parts would be considered in committee. I defer to other hon. Members who may have been in the House for far longer than I have, but my experience of serving on Standing Committees is that having had the first meeting on the Tuesday, we all went away until the following Tuesday to reflect upon our amendments and to try to make sure that they were cogent and not prolix or repetitive. Yet in this Committee we are to start on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly not a matter that I shall press to a vote, but even at this stage will the Minister reconsider? Would it not be to the advantage of the Committee in terms of our efficiency and effectiveness to have what I have always understood to be the usual delay so that there can be sensible reflection on those issues the need consideration? I simply float that idea. Perhaps the Minister will explain why we are starting so quickly on Thursday. There may be some aspects of the matter that I do not yet understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to that caveat, and looking forward to serving on the Committee, I welcome its commencement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can start by answering some of the points that have been raised. The hon. Member for North Dorset inquired about the provisions of part I and asked whether there would be any deviation from those now contained in the Bill. I am able to give the hon. Gentleman some assurance in that the Government do not envisage any substantial amendments to that part of the Bill. Of course, Governments never say "never, ever", but I hope that that will reassure him.

I welcome the comments that have been made. It was clear in the brief debate on the sittings motions that all members of the Committee want to make sure that we take the Bill forward in that way. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has described the way in which he intends to proceed on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I am illustrating my research into Roth's today. It refers to the hon. Gentleman as "a highly intelligent, practical performer".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain later how I intend to proceed, but, from previous experience, may I add that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton), whom I have not looked up in Roth's, has great knowledge and expertise of party political funding. We shall welcome his contribution. I have listened carefully to the points that he wishes to highlight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the way in which I wish to approach the Bill. The fact that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is from Beaconsfield gives me an excuse to tell a favourite political story Disraeli, the first holder of the hon. Gentleman's title. Disraeli once gave the following advice: when dealing with royalty, lay flattery on with a trowel. That is how I intend to make sure that the Government achieve their business. Roth's says that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is not overly partisan, and the way in which he made his comments reflects that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the sittings motion, we are trying to ensure that the conduct of the Bill is such that all members of the Committee can make their points in the way that they wish. Clearly, discussions have taken place through the usual channels. As an ex-member of the Whips Office, I am reluctant to interfere in those discussions. I am sure that further discussions can take place about how best to proceed. Having said that, Mrs. Michie, I urge the Committee to vote for the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesday's at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I should also like to remind hon. Members that, as has already been mentioned, adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee. As hon. Members are aware, the House last night agreed to a motion discharging the Committee from considering parts I and VII of the Bill, together with any new clauses or schedules relating to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
