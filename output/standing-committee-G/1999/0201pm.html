	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 117, leave out lines 8 to 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may seem to cover some of the ground that we covered this morning, but its implications are more sinister. Paragraph 14 of the schedule exempts from disclosure
	<br><q><p>"(a) individuals ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland; or</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) members associations wholly or mainly consisting of members of a Northern Ireland party,"</p></q>
The exemption from disclosure could cover Members of Parliament who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland. Members of the House who represent Northern Ireland constituencies, or those who are ordinarily resident in the Province, could receive money from overseas sources that would otherwise not be permissible and would not have to declare it. That seems to run in the face of the rules of the Register of Members' Interests and is disturbing. It would also apply to Members of the European Parliament from Northern Ireland constituencies who, likewise, would be exempt from the rules of disclosure. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister whether the rules of the House and the European Parliament on members declaring their interests would be paramount when the Member in question might be able to quote from paragraph 14 of schedule 6. That is my first major concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second major concern is paragraph 14(1)(b), which states:
	<br><q><p>"members associations wholly or mainly consisting of members of a Northern Ireland party."</p></q>
One members association wholly or mainly consisting of members of Sinn Fein is the IRA. There are other members associations with paramilitary connotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
Granting such an exemption will open an enormous loophole for foreign funding of paramilitary organisations, even if they are at present in abeyance in Northern Ireland. They could claim to be members associations of Northern Ireland political parties and, therefore, exempt from rules on disclosure. They could continue their activities in complete privacy from the glare of the Electoral Commission and publication of their sources of funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are more concerned about that than about clause 63, which we discussed this morning and which covers the up-front legitimate political parties of Northern Ireland. The amendment covers a range of bodies that may not stand for election and may not be subject to the Representation of the People Act 1983 or other legislation covering elections. I am very concerned about that. Will the Minister say whether individuals who might be Members of Parliament ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland, who can take such foreign money as they care to without disclosure, and organisations that describe themselves as members associations, which might be paramilitary in nature, can benefit from the exemption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up too much of the Committee's time. I shall try to avoid reiterating what my hon. Friend has said. I accept that the schedule is linked to clause 63—it is parallel within the rules, although with a slightly different application, as it relates specifically to exemptions made in terms of information about donors. I want to expand on a point that I touched on earlier, which will be worth while for the Minister to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Human Rights Act 1998, there is a duty to provide free and fair elections. I cannot see how that duty will be fulfilled if, within a country where one is selecting a common Parliament, certain political parties are given financial advantages over others. For example, we have often discussed on the Floor of the House the problems in eastern Europe. Although democracy may have arrived nominally in certain countries, those who are holding power have the whip hand in the distribution of money and in access to the media. They rig elections—that is the usual word—for their own benefit. Clearly, these are matters of fact and degree, but how can we have a free and fair system of political activity if a particular group, party or certain individuals are favoured within the system? Such parties may therefore receive funds that others are not allowed to receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That issue will not go away, and I could equally have raised it under clause 63. It goes to the heart of the matter—if the Bill were to go on the statute book in its current form, and if I were advising a disadvantaged political party, I would suggest a challenge on that issue. Although the de minimis rule might apply, I would have thought that, in the Northern Ireland context, that might prove a bit difficult. There seems to be anecdotal evidence that certain individuals in some parties receive funding from very strange sources, which never comes to public light when it should. The clause appears to allow the Secretary of State, in certain circumstances, the possibility of making rules favouring certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
parties, so that they will not have to make the same disclosures as other parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed the substance and principles of the amendment this morning and in previous sittings. I do not want to retread that argument. Opposition Members voted earlier against the inclusion of clause 63. It has already been established that this schedule, and amendment No. 71, relates to that clause. Logically, one would expect hon. Members who had already taken such a principled position to want to press the matter to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset asked whether the part of the schedule being debated gave an advantage to Members of Parliament residing in Northern Ireland. He asked whether it would be possible for them to avoid disclosure if they made a contribution. That would appear to be the case from reading this part of the schedule, but I remind the hon. Gentleman of a debate earlier today on an amendment in his and his hon. Friends' names about the position of Members of Parliament, who are office-holders as well as members of a political party. Even if we agreed with the substance of his argument, the Member of Parliament would still be disclosed as a condition of his office under paragraph 8(b) of schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset asked whether members of a political association could be members, wherever they came from, of a paramilitary organisation. Again we discussed that issue this morning, although not in detail. A political association is made up mainly of members of a political party. It would be up to the Electoral Commission to inquire of a political party whether an organisation was an associated body. Members of paramilitary organisations seek to disguise their identity, so inquiries would not be easy, but one would be able to identify political associations on the extremes as a result of inquiries by the Electoral Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) made a human rights point. He argued for a level playing field, saying that all political parties should be subject to the same rules. I agree with him. I also agree that the Bill does not imply that that will happen, but I have consistently, over what seems like many days, made it clear that the Government will table amendments to rectify that omission. Although that is only a principle at this stage—I am flying a kite here—the Government intend to table an amendment that sets up a separate register in Northern Ireland. If they do, and if Parliament agrees to it, all parties on the Northern Ireland register would operate on equal terms. I accept that that is not in the Bill, but the amendments that we shall table will establish that no party gains an advantage. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will reflect on the matter and that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment. However, I am conscious that this part of the schedule is inextricably linked to clause 63. On a point of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
principle, hon. Members may therefore feel the need to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue a point with my hon. Friend the Minister, because these questions seem to be similar to those in clause 63 but go further? Does he accept that it is possible for a party operating throughout the United Kingdom to be covered by the clause, because its membership could consists mainly of members of a Northern Ireland party? An organisation such as those that I mentioned this morning—Precious Life or the Pro-Life Alliance—the majority of whose members were in Northern Ireland, would be exempt from disclosure for all their money. If an organisation spent 99 per cent. of its money in, say, Scotland but only 1 per cent. of its members lived there, it would be able to avoid disclosure completely. Is that my hon. Friend's intention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did not strike me until recently that paragraph 1(4)(c) lists among the activities of members associations
	<br><q><p>"promoting or developing policies with a view to their adoption by the party".</p></q>
That assumes that one is referring to the party of which they are members. However, a single-issue campaign group such as Precious Life could seek to influence the policy of another party and spend huge sums of money on attempting to affect, in the west of Scotland, the policy of the Labour party, the Scottish National party or the Conservative party on the issues on which it feels most strongly. As long as most of its members were in Northern Ireland, it would not need to disclose where any of the money had come from. That cannot be the intention of the schedule. Will my hon. Friend the Minister reflect on what I have said and give us appropriate assurances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Stunell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hazel Grove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my apology for my late arrival reached you, Mr. Maxton. I was speaking in the Chamber at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the schedule is very much of a piece with clause 63, and I share all the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) about it. When we were discussing that clause, I said that there was a serious risk that the Bill would create loopholes through which huge avoidance schemes would be deployed and developed. As it is so much in the interests of a party, or a benign donor to a party, to find a way of getting the finance to its destination, those loopholes will be used and exploited. From what I have heard so far from the Minister, that problem does not seem to be properly dealt with in this part of the schedule. It would be logical and consistent for me to say that, having opposed clause 63 on the grounds that it is so bad and so unsatisfactory that it should not be there, the same consideration must apply to this part of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman has said. Had he not been detained elsewhere on other business, he would have heard me say that those who oppose the schedule and who voted against clause 63

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
should on a matter of principle divide the Committee: the two are inextricably linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go over ground that we covered extensively this morning, but one point that I was keen to make this morning and am keen to repeat this afternoon is that, although there will be avoidance mechanisms and party mechanics to try to find evasion techniques—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —avoidance and evasion techniques—the whole attitude in the Bill towards disclosure and openness will make that kind of behaviour rare. I accept that there is a risk of a loophole, but the tone of politics will change as we become more aware of the need to disclose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok referred again to an organisation called Precious Life. I confess that I am not familiar with it. As I understand it, it is an anti-abortion campaign, with some fairly radical views perhaps, which operates in Northern Ireland and Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Candy Atherton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falmouth and Camborne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has reactionary views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, reactionary. We could have an interesting discussion about the meaning of the word "radical". "Radical" does not always mean progressive; it is possible to be radical in a very reactionary way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I agree that terms can be deceptive, I should draw my hon. Friend's attention to one of my favourite press headlines, which was published in Portugal in the 1960s. It states,
	<br><q><p>"Moderates Bomb Communist Party Offices". [	<i>Laughter</i>]</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All such matters are relative—the question is, for what did that party stand? Of course, one must make judgments according to the party in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precious Life operates in Northern Ireland and Scotland, but the way in which its membership is split is not important to the argument. Under the Bill, it will be possible for money to be collected in Northern Ireland and transferred to Scotland. Committee members have discussed the matter at length, and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) has particularly strong views on it. This morning, reference was made to loopholes, watertight firebreaks, and associated imagery. The Government anticipate that they will table an amendment that will stop the transfer of funds by a party that is registered in Northern Ireland, but operates in Scotland. Like the Tory party, which operates in Northern Ireland and Scotland, it may be that a party will hold joint discussions on policy. There is nothing wrong with that, but the Government are keen to prevent a Northern Ireland party from gaining money from the Republic—or from overseas via the Republic—and transferring it to a United Kingdom-based party that operates on the mainland. The possibility of evasion is real, and we will need to work hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the discussion on the amendment has progressed, I have become increasingly concerned. We seem to be debating the single currency concept in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
reverse, which holds that, in some way, moneys will not flow from Northern Ireland to Scotland. I know that one of the bidders for Nat West bank—perhaps it was the Bank of Scotland—has said that it would close down the Northern Ireland branches. However, like the hon. Member for Pollok, my concerns have broadened. Yet again, the Bill flies in the face of the concept that it is trying to create. I shall not rehearse this morning's arguments about clause 63, but I should say that the Minister has yet to allay our fears, so we propose to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier today, it appeared that I might not reach the Committee Room in time but for this debate, but I am delighted to have arrived in time. The amendment, and an amendment that appears in the name of the hon. Member for Battersea, have overlapping intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would delete paragraph (b) because it contains the phrase
	<br><q><p>"or otherwise enhancing in any way the electoral prospects of, any particular candidate."</p></q>
That wide and possibly unnecessary exemption might have unintended consequences. I hope that the Minister will say that he is aware of those consequences and, if they are intended, that they are intended. The phrase that I quoted might create another famous loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that, when we seek to control campaign expenditure, we actually do so. We do not want to encourage additional national campaign spending that will be exempted by provisions elsewhere in the Bill. Perhaps the total national campaign expenditure should include individual local campaign expenditures even if that means that the absolute ceiling should be increased. That might prevent sums from falling into the gap that exists between the expenditure that is declared in support of a particular candidate in an election or contest and the use of such expenditure to promote a party at the national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
That gap could be brought about in several ways—perhaps most obviously by the role that is played by party leaders. The next general election might be fought with billboard posters of the Prime Minister, although we might hope that next time he will appear with a more benign expression than we witnessed last time. Those posters might involve
	<br><q><p>"otherwise enhancing in any way the electoral prospects of"</p></q>
a particular candidate. The promotion of an individual might involve promoting him in a particular contest—in Sedgefield—and/or at the national level in support of a party or a party image or message. I hope that the Minister has considered that example and that he is satisfied either that it will not happen or that it will happen, that that was the Government's intention and that the Bill can accommodate the situation. The latter option does not appear to be likely, but it is not unfeasible. In this context, we are discussing a single-candidate party. A party called the London mayoral party might be established with the aim of electing a particular mayoral candidate. It could promote its candidate widely—perhaps beyond London—but might be able to escape some of the controls on national expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has commonly been held that, if one is promoting a candidate in a contest, such expenditure counts only if it is in the geographic area of that contest. The cost of distributing a load of leaflets in a neighbouring constituency, whether by accident or by design, does not form part of the election expenses of a particular campaign. As I once fought a general election camgaign in a constituency on the boundaries of England and Wales, and the Post Office was not able to recognise that Boundary lane was literally the boundary between the two countries, I fully understand the importance of the issue, at least at the local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording is capable of leaving a gap between provisions at the local level and those at the national level. I want to hear the Minister tell me that I have got that wrong. I also want him to tell me whether there is any reason in principle why he would not consider aggregating local and national spending on campaigns. A comprehensive total would make my concern irrelevant, as it would be covered one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start by the dealing with the matter of principle. It is an issue to which I suspect we shall return when we discuss amendment No. 32, which has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. The amendment clarifies the issue and brings it into sharp focus. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) accepted that some overlap existed. The Government are clear on the matter of principle, as was Neill. We have to start from where we are, and we have to draw on the only legislation that we have—the Representation of the People Act 1983. The simple way forward is to introduce new legislation, which runs parallel to the 1983 Act. As all hon. Members know, the 1983 Act considers
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
individual candidates, and keeps individual candidates' expenses on one side. The proposed new legislation, which we are considering, sets a limit—or cap—on the amount that a registered party can spend. That is for the sake of simplicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of time, the Electoral Commission might want to examine that issue. One of the points that I made to the Cttee this morning was that, because of the way in which we conduct legislative business, legislation surrounding elections becomes ossified. That is difficult to change. Instead of examining the size of patios or measuring up the value of an item at auction, I hope that the Electoral Commission will keep its eye on the big picture and examine such notions. The idea of bringing the two systems together is not ruled out for all time. For the sake of progress and the desire among all political parties for new legislation—which my party promised would be in place for the next general election—we believe that this is the route to take. I admit that our approach is for practical reasons rather than based on matters of principle, but, sometimes, that is what is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove asked me to consider a number of issues, and asked whether I was aware of particular problems. Cttee members imagine new scenarios all the time. I freely confess that, even in my wildest dreams or nightmares I could not have imagined all the new scenarios that were suggested. One of the scenarios that we were asked to consider was that of a series of election posters all over the country featuring not red eyes, but, perhaps in a presidential style, a benign Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and leader of the Labour party. Clearly, if the posters appeared across the country, they would be part of the national campaign. It is also clear that if the posters appeared only in the north-east, in the constituency of Sedgefield, they would be promoting a particular candidate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove always asks hard questions. He cited the example of Boundary lane, which exists between England and Wales. If posters were on both sides of Boundary lane, there would be a problem, but if a poster were on one side of Boundary lane by mistake, it would not, realistically speaking, be a problem. It is a matter of degree and judgment which the Electoral Commission will want to consider. Although it is possible to stretch an example, it is relatively clear, if one focuses on the matter, what is intended to be a party's national campaign and what is used to promote an individual candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. I accept the generality of what he says. However, I point out that a feasible defence of—or, alternatively, a feasible attack on—such posters appearing in, say, Surrey could be that they did not have to be included as part of the national campaign because they did not in any way—or, alternatively, did in some way—enhance the electoral prospects of the Prime Minister. A degree of ambiguity is involved, which might provide a loophole in certain circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have made progress on that point. The hon. Gentleman used the phrase "a matter of judgment", and clearly either the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
commission or the courts will ultimately have to make a judgment. However, I think that good sense will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other example, which was even more intriguing, was that of a person standing as the Labour mayoral candidate for London who put up posters not only in London, but across the rest of the country. It would be a very poor Labour mayoral candidate who took such an approach. One puts one's resources where one's muscle is, and where one wants to get the vote out. That was an unlikely scenario.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to accept the amendment, because it has an unforeseen aspect. Clause 65 is not the clearest in the world, but if the hon. Gentleman looks at it closely he will see that subsection (7)(a) is almost identical to subsection (5)(b), which his amendment would delete. In a sense, a double precaution was taken in drafting the Bill. I would be pleased to be able to accept the amendment, because it would put up the score rate that hon. Members were discussing earlier today. However, if I did so, the preceding line of the clause would be left hanging on the word "but", and that would be untidy. I give a commitment to pick up the amendment on the point of detail, rather than principle, and include it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments, and especially for directing me to subsection (7)(a), which makes it clear that election expenses that would be declared at a particular election are to be excluded. The middle of paragraph (b) hints at another situation, perhaps not connected to local election expenses. The Minister may be right to say that subsection (7)(a) is superior in achieving his intention. It also avoids the ambiguity of paragraph (b). I also understand his point about drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that subsection (7)(a) will give the Minister what he wants, and the absence of subsection (5)(b), subject to a new Government amendment, will give me what I want. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 41, leave out lines 35 to 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister is right in saying that this is probably the most opaque clause in the Bill. It also deals with the conduct of elections, a subject on which all members of the Committee have some expertise. I shall not detain the Committee long on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of my amendment is to reduce the spending limit for parliamentary elections. The Bill imposes two limits: the present limit on the amount that candidates can spend in their constituencies, which, at a national level, is about £5 million; and a new limit on the amount that parties can spend on a national campaign, with a suggested level of £20 million. The amendment would collapse those two limits into a single pot, covering both local and national spending. That would have two separate effects—to remove the phoney distinction between local and national campaign spending and to reduce the effective limit on national campaign spending from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
£20 million to £15 million. The first effect has something in common with the amendment recently tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to persuade a room full of politicians how artificial the distinction is between local and national campaign spending. For the past 48 years, we have lived with a strange anomaly in election law. A poster beside the A30 running through the constituency of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) that said, "Vote Walter—Conservative" would have to be declared by the hon. Gentleman on his election return as an election expense. However, a poster in exactly the same spot that said, "Vote Conservative" would not need to be so declared, nor would it be subject to any spending limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with that anomaly; the "Vote Conservative" poster would have to be declared in the national campaign spending returns. However, it does not deal with the first anomaly, in that this strange distinction between local and national campaign spending would be allowed to persist. My hon. Friend says that that would be more practical. I believe that it would be more practical to do it the other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with interest. Under the terms of the amendment, if I were an independent candidate, would I be allowed to spend £15 million on an election campaign in my constituency if I were minded to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the difficulties of having national campaign spending limits, because they apply only to parties, and not to individual candidates. I shall leave it to my hon. Friend the Minister to explain exactly how the Bill manages to square the circle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the notion of an independent candidate involves there being only one person. The notion of a political party involves there being more than one. That is how we arrive at the different equations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 35, in my name, deals more directly with the level of the national limit. The Conservative party, in giving evidence to the Neill committee, proposed that there should be no limit at all. Indeed, the one Conservative member of the Neill committee, the right hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), put in a minority clause opposing a limit. The Bill proposes a limit of £20 million, which was the Neill committee proposals. The Labour party proposed in its evidence a limit of £15 million; the Liberal Democrats proposed no specific limit, but on being pressed when giving evidence to the committee, they suggested £10 million to £12 million. My amendment would adopt the Labour proposal of £15 million, but I shall save detailed discussion on that for when we consider amendment No. 35.

I am trying to avoid a situation where parties can spend a lot of money on marginal constituencies and almost nothing on constituencies that they believe they have no chance of winning or are almost certain to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
win. I do not need to tell hon. Members that there is no such thing as being certain to win. Many people went into the last election believing that and were disabused of the idea. However, it is observable from election returns that the parties spend far more on marginal seats than on safe or unwinnable seats. That may be an efficient use of resources for them, but it is not a fair spread of resources for voters. Those who live in a seat that one party may describe as hopeless, unwinnable, an electoral desert or with not a snowball's chance in hell, or which the opposite party describes as safe, rock-solid, a fortress or a bastion, can be sure that they will be almost completely ignored. The candidate may come along with an election address and perhaps one or two disconsolate supporters. However, we all know that those who live in marginal seats will be inundated with coachloads of canvassers. The slightest inquiry to the candidate will immediately be attended to and any amount of paper will come through the letterbox. Indeed, the local pubs will have to order special supplies of food for pub lunches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman also concede that, miraculously, all that will be achieved inside the legal election limits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed miraculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having decided to recommend a national spending limit, the Neill committee then discussed the relative merits of what it calls an integrated or separated limit. The report says:
	<br><q><p>"An integrated limit would be one in which the national and constituency limits were combined to produce a single global limit".</p></q>
That is what I am trying to achieve in the amendment. The report goes on:
	<br><q><p>"The amounts of money that the parties were permitted to spend nationally would not be treated, for legal purposes, as a single national pool but would instead be divided up 	<i>pro rata</i> among the parties' candidates in individual constituencies."</p></q>
Thus, if a party had a national poster campaign, the cost would have to be divided between all the constituency candidates for seats in that region. The limit would clearly have to be much higher than the present limit. Indeed, it would be sensible to accept the figure in the Bill of £30,000 per constituency and turn that into an overall limit for local and national spending. The Neill committee decided against that in the end, but said:
	<br><q><p>"One advantage of this approach is that it would be 'traditional'. It would build on the existing system, modifying it only in order to reverse the modification that was itself introduced by 	<i>Tronoh Mines."</i></p></q>
That is an important point, because in the first half of the last century the parties believed that to be the approach. Indeed, little was spent on national campaigns; most election spending was at the local level. As recently as 1950, it is related in the Neill report, Violet Attlee drove her party leader round in an Austin Seven with one security man, and that was almost the total cost of the Labour party's national campaign. I dare say that the Conservatives spent a little more, but it was at a low level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
In 1952, a Malaysian tin mining company called Tronoh put a small advertisement in a Cornish newspaper, in which it advised its clients to vote Conservative because it was concerned about the threat of nationalisation. The judges' decision that the advertisement did not constitute an election expense, which surprised the parties at the time, opened the spending floodgates for national campaigns. The general election of 1955 was the first television election. National campaign expenditure now accounts for more than 90 per cent. of all election expenditure. Local expenditure accounts for a mere 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can doubtless see that the anomaly that began with a 1950s legal case has grown into the dominating factor in election expenditure law. The Neill committee and the Bill accept that anomaly, and a separate limit is set for national campaign spending. It would be more effective to revert to the law as it should have been before judges misinterpreted it, and set a single limit for local candidates and national campaigns. Parties would be unable ruthlessly to concentrate spending on marginal seats and ignore others, and the interests of the voter would be paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that, on studying my amendment closely and consulting the Committee Clerk, I am no longer convinced that it would achieve my objective, so I am happy to withdraw it. However, I want to hear why my hon. Friend the Minister thinks that the solution proposed by the Neill committee and in the Bill would be more practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the comments of the hon. Member for Battersea. I understand the thrust of his arguments, but when I try to marry it to the detail of his amendment, I experience doubts. In theory, an individual's campaign expenditure is very different from a political party's national campaign expenditure. There may be no link to a political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the question that I put to the hon. Gentleman during an intervention was a tiny bit flippant—I find this clause difficult to follow in any case—an unintended consequence of his amendment would be the removal of an individual's election expenditure ceiling. The Minister may say that I have got that wrong, and I appreciate that the legislation is entirely separate. The clause attempts to differentiate between the control of campaign expenditure and an individual's election expenses, but the amendment would delete the reference to an individual's election expenses, thereby leaving their status hanging in the air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must accept that, in theory, there may be a ceiling on am individual's own constituency election expenses, whether they are paid by him or by his political party or association. In addition, there is a limit for the national campaign. If no distinction is drawn between the two, the floodgates to bizarre inconsistencies will be opened with regard to independents. Independents who stand in particular constituencies might never have the status of a political party, but they may be entitled to expenditure up to the national party limit. Alternatively, they will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
penalised because, not being a political party, they will have no ability to spend money. I am not sure which it would be. A third possibility is that someone standing as an independent could be paid for his personal expenditure, but someone standing as a party member could not. One or two of those illustrations may be far-fetched, but they are possible consequences of deleting the paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is obscure and certainly tricked me. The first effect of the amendment would be to make the £5 million local spending limits part of, rather than additional to, the national limit of £20 million. My other objective was to ensure the same limit in every constituency. If it were £30,000, that would resolve the problem of the independents because they would have the same local and national combined limit as any party candidate. That would ensure a level playing field for independents and party candidates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's clarification, but I still believe that there are problems. Trying to subsume individual limits for constituencies into the national limit is unworkable in practice, although I understand the theory of the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, I am not the expert and it is the Minister's responsibility to reply, so I shall be delighted to hear how he believes the amendment would work in practice; I may then comment further on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea covered the ground well and I listened to him closely. I heard him say that, on reflection and having taken advice, the amendment would not do the job that he intended and that he was inclined to withdraw it. I am grateful for that and also for his helpful response to the draft Bill. He was one of the few hon. Members who responded. He raised the matter on Second Reading and during our sittings motions he highlighted the fact that he wanted to pursue the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 and my hon. Friend's later amendment No. 35 approach a similar objective from different directions. Amendment No. 32 would reduce the amount spent on entertaining by bringing local spending, constituency spending and candidate spending together with national spending. Amendments Nos. 32 and 35 have the same aim, but their consequences would bring the amount of the national campaign to around £15 million which, as my hon. Friend said, is the sum that Labour proposed when giving evidence to the Neill committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are arguments for reducing the amount spent nationally. I remind the Committee that the Neill committee considered that and identified the fact that, in the previous general election, the two major parties spent £26 million and £28 million. The Labour party's argument to the Neill committee was for a cap of £15 million and the Liberal Democrats, when pressed, suggested a figure of between £10 million and £12 million. The figure should be discussed. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said on Second Reading that there is nothing sacrosanct about it. If a case can be made for an alternative figure, we might consider it. The figure of almost £20 million is about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
right. We cannot aspire to reach the £10 million figure. We have stopped the arms race, but to go too far might makes things difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that we hardly aspire to reach that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed how much interest my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) was taking in this debate. Coachloads of people went to help in marginal constituencies. She will have heard the hon. Member for Hazel Grove say that the Liberal Democrats do not aspire to spend up to £10 million. Perhaps that suggests that they do not aspire to work hard in Falmouth and Camborne. Given the complexities of that constituency, that may or may not be a good thing. We shall discuss capping expenditure when we reach amendment No. 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea asked whether we would consider joining constituency local spending with national spending. The Neill committee considered the matter and decided against it on practical grounds. I said earlier that we want to build on the approach that was taken in the Representation of the People Act 1983, in the relevant constituency legislation and in the legislation that restricts party spending. I do not believe that our approach will be set in stone for ever. There are strong arguments in principle for bringing together local and national spending. I expect that, when the Electoral Commission is up and running and has some experience, that matter will appear on the political agenda. My hon. Friend said in his opening remarks that he would withdraw the amendment. I hope that he will give the Committee the benefit of that early judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to manifestos. The schedule contains a list of items that have to be included in the qualifying expenses for campaign expenditure. Sub-paragraph (4) states that that list must contain

and any costs that are incurred
	<br><q><p>"in connection with preparing or producing or distributing or otherwise disseminating any such document."</p></q>
Liberal Democrats have no difficulty with including on that list costs that are incurred in the production or distribution of such documents, or with "otherwise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
disseminating" them. However, we wanted to test the Minister on the issue of "preparing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preparing a manifesto or any other document setting out a party's policies may be a lengthy and complex process involving all kinds of aspects that are hard to measure and keep track of. My party's policy-making process will start with a working party that meets several times at various locations in the country, perhaps over a period of months, or even a year or more, and a green paper will then be presented to our conference for endorsement. I could continue—there are several more stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the way in which the Bill sets out the cost of preparing those documents is far too all-embracing and appears to rule out a great deal of grass-roots policy making, which is certainly important for us, and is probably important—at various phases of their political cycles—for all other political parties. The amendment is straightforward, and I hope that the Minister feels that there is something to be said for its general intent, if not its precise form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 57 would leave out sub-paragraph (2). I may have to return to that later, Mr. Maxton, because at the moment I cannot see what it is trying to do. However, I am very clear about amendment No. 56.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments have different purposes. Amendment No. 56 is a probing amendment by which the hon. Member for Hazel Grove seeks to establish that the preparation of the manifesto in terms of policy development work—discussions that take place at seminars and conferences over a long period—is not included under the schedule. In this context, preparation of the manifesto or other policy documents means the preparation of a document or manifesto, which includes design work, pictures and text preparation as a prelude to its production and printing. It would be strange, given that clause 10 provides for public policy development grants—public money to allow parties to prepare their policies—to deprive parties in that way under the schedule. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that that is not our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendment No. 57, I think that the hon. Gentleman is worried about the powers of the Secretary of State, which is a theme that he has pursued at various points in our proceedings. He appears to be anxious that the Secretary of State should act in a dispassionate, non-partisan way. I hope that I can reassure him on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives the Electoral Commission, over a period, the opportunity to compose and change schedule 7. The schedule's lists of expenditure that can be paid out and prohibited may change over time. For example, some of my hon. Friends are keen to have new technology reflected in the Bill. The Electoral Commission will be able to compose schedule 7 with the Secretary of State. If the hon. Gentleman looks at paragraph 6 of the schedule, he will see that it has to be laid before the House of Commons—not as an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
affirmative resolution, but in a similar way. Given the circumstances, it must be right for the Secretary of State to receive advice from the commission and to act as an agent by putting it before the House. He will be the conduit enabling changes to be made to schedule 7. The hon. Gentleman does not want the Secretary of State to have unbridled powers. I hope that I have reassured him on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for helpfully forestalling my arguments. It is encouraging to hear him say that the costs of preparing a manifesto will not be included, even though the Bill states that they will. Elucidation on the point might be helpful before the Bill is passed. Assuming that elucidation will be forthcoming, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister properly set out the arguments for amending part III of the schedule that I would have deployed, and which I have deployed elsewhere. The words that had especially caused my hackles to rise were:
	<br><q><p>"after consultation with the Commission."</p></q>
The Secretary of State may operate in two modes—first, acting on the commission's recommendation and, secondly, having consulted the commission, doing something that he had thought up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reassurances that I have been given. I hope that, in the 117-year life of the Bill, nobody will ever regret our having left the words in. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We now embark on the consideration of several clauses in which similar issues arise. The probing amendment would delete subsection (5), which criminalises the failures to which the clause refers. It reflects my anxiety about the burden to be placed on individuals' shoulders regarding campaign expenditure. The Minister will have noticed that I have deliberately not put down a marker on subsection (4)(b)—I accept that criminal sanctions should attach to a return that is fraudulent or that has been done improperly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To breach any of the requirements in the Bill would be a criminal offence. I am concerned that we are placing too great a burden on individuals. Might there be an initial spate of prosecutions of people who find that they are unable to keep tabs of campaign expenditure? Would they fall foul of these provisions and end up in the magistrates court? That might depend partly on the Electoral Commission's view of the exercise of its discretion. I am sure that the commission will try to differentiate between flagrant breaches and inadvertent incompetence. However, we are giving it great discretion.

5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us will agree that election campaigns are especially hectic. Rapid decisions are taken and the exercise of such rational control as may be wished for in an ideal world is not always the most prominent feature. Emergencies arise, so the till is—quite properly—dipped into. Money is produced and a worker is told, "Go and deal with this at once." He may be dispatched to obtain something. It may be late and the office may be about to close. The volunteer should come in the following day with the receipt but may not do so because he has something else on—he is not an employee, after all—and the receipt goes missing. We shall consider such problems as we progress because, one after another, the clauses pile criminal responsibility onto those who do not conform to the tight regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I applaud the desire to see matters regularised down to the dotting of the i's and the crossing of the t's. However, I wonder whether that will happen or whether it is possible in the way envisaged. I would be grateful for the Minister's opinion of the way in which the issue should best be approached. Are criminal sanctions on what I call the individual stepping stones appropriate? I accept that the final criminal sanction might be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might also have approached the issue by altering the £100 limit specified in subsection (1)(b). In an amendment to another clause, I have suggested raising it to £250. I accept that there may be an inconsistency if it were not raised in this clause, too. I hope that the Minister accepts that all the probing amendments are intended to begin a necessary discussion on the topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there are two issues, the first relating to the sum that might be spent without having to produce chapter and verse details or returns, and the second relating to the criminalisation of failures. I float the possibility of introducing sanctions that do not amount to the criminal conviction of individuals. One would have to reconsider the Bill closely, but it would essentially mean that a failure to act properly regarding X amount would require the forfeit of Y amount. The burden would not be put so explicitly on the poor association treasurers who must deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that, ultimately, no one in his right mind will be willing to take on that job. We all know the reality of the work. I do not know your experience of your association, Mr. Maxton, nor what it is like in the Labour party, but I know what it is like in the Conservative party. The position of association treasurer is always the hardest to fill. The job involves the thankless task of having to produce the annual accounts and to keep tabs on a group of workers who, while willing, are nevertheless not beholden to the person concerned or in any way under his or her control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden on such people will be intolerable. When the hideous penalties that might be visited on them for failing to comply with the relevant clauses are pointed out to them, it will be impossible to find local party treasurers—certainly at association level. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
notice the hon. Member for Hazel Grove nodding in agreement, so perhaps he thinks that there is some merit in what I am saying. How does the Minister think that the arrangement will work in practice? Will he remember that the willing and helpful civil servants who have drafted the legislation have, by the nature of their calling, not the slightest idea how a local constituency association works?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said. I would just add that there is an alternative to not finding anyone to do the job; finding someone to do it who then refuses to release money for anything, so that campaigns grind to a halt. That problem in getting treasurers to agree to campaign plans might not be entirely outside hon. Members' experience anyway. I do not expect anyone to nod openly, but hon. Members may talk to me quietly afterwards. What is proposed will not make it any easier to overcome existing difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield did not point out the significance of the size of the unit concerned. The Minister might like to reflect on the fact that the persons affected by the provision might vary widely in their knowledge and responsibility. They could range from the national party treasurer—who could not be given an exemption and would need to be made to comply, because the mischief of not doing so would be so great—to my friend Mrs. Brown in Littledon village branch, who has the utmost difficulty in comprehending the basics of electoral law and campaign procedure and who relies on a Post Office bank book. Someone who was doing a good job for the party and making a valuable contribution to civic society and who would never win anything in a month of Sundays could nevertheless be turned into a criminal for losing a receipt. We need proportionate responses to varied situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I said earlier that officials had appeared bemused, I noticed body language that suggested I had chosen the wrong word. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield suggested that they are completely out of touch with what happens in the real world of constituency parties. I hope that he will not suffer the same obloquy that my choice of words occasioned. However, it is a fact that the legal draftsmen and civil servants do not have detailed knowledge of how the relevant voluntary organisations work. I am sure that the Minister would agree that most party workers and office holders in all parties—this is not a party point—do what they do from dedication to their cause. They are committed to making it a success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Julian Lewis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Gentleman's argument. So far we have heard similar views from the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats. I recall when, in my time as an activist for the Labour party, the objection that was made to the use of court action by those of us who called ourselves moderates but who did not believe in bombing the communist headquarters—and I remember the then Prime Minister Jim Callaghan articulating this argument—was that it was unfair to tell Labour party constituency activists: "You have made a slight slip-up in the rules and we will take you to court." Only the belief that ruthless abuses of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
procedures were being carried out seemed to us to justify such action. However, that is not the case now and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove have made a very fair point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much hesitate to sign up to that line of thought, but in so far as the amendment is intended to make the penalty proportionate to the offence and the mischief that that offence might cause, I am entirely in accord with it. I hope for a helpful response from the Minister, bearing in mind that he has already undertaken to have a look at the various steps with respect to the size of accounting units. It was suggested this morning that there might be some connection between that matter and the level of donations. Perhaps we should consider it in relation to the severity of the offence, or even the question whether an offence has been committed. Whether the amount of money or the size of accounting unit involved is used as a level below which an offence will not have been committed, it seems entirely feasible to devise appropriate watertight wording. I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled amendments, which will be debated later, concerned with ensuring that the rules are not so onerous as to make a breach almost inevitable. I felt entirely at home with what the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said about the urgency and potential muddle that can arise in campaigns. I am not talking about what should happen in a national campaign or a closely-contested parliamentary election. The provision would apply to shire district elections with a few hundred electors, where Mrs. Brown would be doing her best in difficult and trying circumstances. She would be hit by the measure just as much as the national party treasurer would. In the rush and confusion so skilfully outlined by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, it would be difficult to avoid accidental breaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond helpfully and provide some assurance that he does not mean to erect barriers so high as to prevent not just offences but campaigning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me say at the outset that I understand the concerns raised by the hon. Gentlemen. The amendment is the first of a series that have been tabled with respect to the criminal elements in the Bill. I want to reassure the Committee and I remind hon. Members that the draft Bill was produced in July. Much effort has been expended in consulting the political parties with a view to devising a workable Bill. We have perhaps not engaged the parties enough in that, but the door has always been open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield excitedly talked about the hurly-burly of a political campaign. Some of us sometimes wonder whether we are involved in politics because we enjoy the buzz and excitement of campaigning and winning, rather than policy development and achieving things. I was gripped by the remarks of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but he should remember that the part of the Bill under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
discussion deals with control of election expenditure. We have specified a period of 365 days for a general election to enforce that control and a period of four months for another election, such as an assembly or European election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of those provisions, the hurly-burly that usually arises in the last few days of a campaign will not always arise, but there will be a longer campaign period and better accountancy practices will have to be put in place. I like the notion of a person nipping out of a shop or campaign headquarters, buying something and then forgetting to give the receipt in. I know those circumstances only too well and I recognise them easily. Of course, the Bill contains a de minimis provision, which the hon. Gentleman recognised in a later amendment that seeks to set an expenditure threshold of £250. Small problems such as running out of stationery will not arise and are covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Committee is confused; the clause addresses national savings on campaigns, and the controls for which we are asking relate to national expenditure. We are not seeking to impose sanctions on Mrs. Brown or on anybody in the local party. Subsection (4)(b) makes it clear that the sanctions apply to the treasurer or deputy treasurer of a national party, and there may be up to 12 deputies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to take it that the expression "registered party" as it appears in the clause would not include an accounting unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the national perspective, the national cap and accounting for the national cap. The clause concerns a small group of people, who should be qualified and who, by definition, will have been appointed because they were viewed as able to make a mature judgment. I do not think that many of the anxieties expressed should therefore arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's criminal sanctions have been of some concern, and I understand the sensitivities involved. The many hon. Members who have read the Bill closely will have noticed that defence clauses have been inserted at various points. The Government do not intend—and I suspect that the Electoral Commission does not intend—to pursue people relentlessly for an error. Clearly, the prospect of prosecution will be minimised for people who have acted in good faith, given their best endeavours and acted on the information available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Julian Lewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried by that reassurance, which means that deciding whether someone is prosecuted will be a very subjective process. Should we not be concerned about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has brought me to the point. It must be right that people who have made false declarations, acted in bad faith and knowingly deceived should be prosecuted. That is the point of the clause. Sometimes, however, people will have acted in good faith but got it wrong. The Bill gives the commission the power to go back to people and say, "Eh up, me duck," as they would in Nottinghamshire,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
"Reflect on this. Have you got it right? Can we have clarification?" As well as there being a defence, the commission has the opportunity to challenge a declaration before a final prosecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right; if people make false declarations, they should be prosecuted. The key point to remember is that we are talking not about the Mrs. Browns of this world or the treasurer of a small accounting unit, but about the national treasurer and the 12 deputies. Although I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, I accept that criminalisation is a serious issue, but we have got to the core of it in our dialogue with the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was misled in thinking that the subsection would apply to individual accounting units. Looking ahead, I see that individual expenditure is covered in clause 90. No, I am mistaken; it is in part VIII, clause 122, which is headed
	<br><q><p>"Control of candidates' election expenses".</p></q>
I said clause 90 because it revisits section 90 of the Representation of the People Act 1 983. That is where my confusion crept in. We may wish to return to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it will be easier to control national expenditure that is administered by a party's headquarters, but we must remember that the provision will also apply to small registered parties. Their problems may be different from those that are experienced at a national level by the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative party. Those parties are likely to employ accountants full time during an election to keep track of expenditure and to spot potential problems. However, as I am partially reassured by the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Minister's attention to terms in the clause such as "market value", "free of charge" and "commercial rate". I understand that I have to retable amendments to clause 146 but, as that is a long way off, I want him to be aware of the words in clauses 66 and 146 that do not overlap or correspond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 66(1)(a) refers to
	<br><q><p>"any property, services or facilities",</p></q>
which implies that there are three categories. Clause 146 mentions market value and property, which
	<br><q><p>"accordingly include the supply of goods".</p></q>
That may, or may not, include services and facilities. Clause 66 refers to the
	<br><q><p>"commercial rate for … use or for the provision of the services or facilities"</p></q>
and to the market value
	<br><q><p>"or that rate … payable by or on behalf of the party, the expenses incurred",</p></q>
and so on. I do not ask the Minister even to attempt a detailed explanation of what all those words mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
However, I point out that clause 146 refers to "market value" and "property" and various associated, so-called definitions, but in clause 66 there is a completely different set of terms, which includes "services or facilities" and "commercial rate". There are serious problems in respect of clause 66 which perhaps we can solve by putting the definitions in clause 146 in order; they certainly bear careful investigation. I shall table amendments to clause 146 that I hope will clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Electoral Commission to issue a standard set of definitions as guidance for people filling in expenses returns in accordance with the provisions on compliance or notification of expenditure in this part of the Bill. The commission could provide what would be, in effect, a code of conduct, or a code of right answers, that would put such returns beyond challenge, while at the same time—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.11 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before our short break, I was saying that the language used in various parts of the Bill was confusing, and perhaps worse. Even if the language in the Bill were consistent and compatible throughout, important issues of principle would remain as to whether certain things would be taken into account and how that should be done. For example, clause 66 refers to services provided free of charge. It has already been established that a volunteer will be able to offer services free of charge without their being included in the calculation. When I asked the Minister whether that meant that the volunteer's house, car or garage might be used, I think he said that it meant that only the volunteer's personal service would be regarded as free. I understand that clause 66 refers only to the national party campaign and, therefore, that the contribution that an individual or his car might make to that campaign is comparatively trivial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To move on to something less trivial, the clause refers to
	<br><q><p>"the market value of the property or … the commercial rate for its use".</p></q>
Parties commonly have leased accommodation. In addition, they might lease accommodation for a particular purpose during a campaign or dedicate a room, floor or building that they already hold for use specifically in that campaign, depending on its size and purpose, and that would appear to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up the reference to "commercial rate". The definitions relating to property in clause 146 refer to
	<br><q><p>"the price which might reasonably be expected to be paid for the property on a sale in the open market."</p></q>
We should consider what that might mean, bearing in mind the fact that many leases are historic leases, which do not necessarily reflect the full commercial value. I foresee some difficulties there, which can be overcome but need to be considered, partly in the light of the freedom of information argument that was mentioned earlier. The last thing we want to do is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
leave such uncertainty in the definitions that it is possible for mud to be thrown, inquiries to be held and newspaper articles to be written, despite the fact that a party is doing its best and believes that it has complied with proper practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my earlier point: we need a code of accountancy practice that is produced by the Electoral Commission. Demonstration by a party that its return has been filled in accordance with the code should be sufficient for the discharge of its responsibilities. It would be better to introduce such a code than to leave the rather airy-fairy definitions about which I have spoken floating about in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed auction prizes, which might seem trivial at the national party level. I thought so until I heard that £13,000 can be raised from the sale of a gavel. Such a sale is not trivial and might be a substantial factor. What is the value of an auction prize given to a party? Is it the ordinary going rate that would apply if the prize were sold in a shop or is it the market value achieved when the bidding stops? Sometimes a party might obtain best value for money by claiming the former, but in relation to other parts of the legislation it will obtain best value by claiming that the prize has the other value. Does the legislation apply to the first price, the second price or the net difference, and where do these differences come into play?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not asking the Minister to answer now, and I appreciate that a clause stand part debate should involve only the questioning and signalling of issues and difficulties that must be faced. The clause and other provisions dealing both with national and local party campaigns contain a number of phrases and implications on their application. These points should be addressed, as the last thing that we need is the uncertainty and difficulty currently present in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue that exact point with my hon. Friend the Minister. My personal circumstances suggest that there may be a need to tighten the phrase "market values". As it happens, I have a splendid constituency office, whose costs were charged not to an office costs allowance but to election returns on a precisely pro rata basis for the duration of the election period. As it happens to suit the landlord to have someone—I expect no ribaldry at the following remark—whom he can trust in the building without incurring large alteration costs, I have an arrangement of payments which is, in my judgment, below the property's market value. I do not think that the clause is intended to catch people in a similar position, but it would be wrong to write into law provisions covering things that we do not intend to happen. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the phrase "market value" is not meant in its absolutely literal sense?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that we were making progress. Although my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford South (Mr. Sutcliffe) twitched when he made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
that comment, I am grateful to him for giving us notice of issues that he wishes to pursue later in our proceedings. He reasonably expressed his view that there are discrepancies between the terms used in the clause and the definitions contained in clause 146.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consider the points that the hon. Gentleman raised, but they involve an issue of principle about which I do not think that there is any argument. The making of donations whose claimed value is obviously below their real price is, in effect, a subsidy to a political party that will give that party an advantage and others a disadvantage. I should like to take a couple of examples. One is the topical issue of poster sites. Controversially, those have been made available to one political party that has pre-booked them so that no other party can use them. Some have even been provided at a discounted price. A judgment should be made about the value of donations. The other example is that of property. A political party might receive a donation of a large and imposing building, perhaps like the one mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), for which it would not have to pay the real rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a stable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is a large and imposing Member of Parliament who occupies it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only speculate on my hon. Friend's position. He rents a building that is possibly in need of improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The building is in a wonderful condition, but to make it suitable for a second tenant, the landlord has to undertake major alterations. He does not want to do that because of the nature of the building, but to get the rent, he needs a tenant with whom he can have a trusting relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should rephrase. The landlord would get more out of his building if building works took place. He does not want to do that, but he does want to have a tenant whom he can trust, and who better than my hon. Friend? The office costs allowance pays the rent save for the duration of the campaign period, when the expenses are met by political funds. The gap can only be four, five or six weeks. The market rent cannot change in that time and the landlord could not find a better tenant than my hon. Friend. That was an easy example, but I do not want Committee members to find harder ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove mentioned leases, which run for a longer period. They are, to a large extent, historic documents. Again, that is a relatively easy matter. However, he made some relevant points and we shall try to anticipate his needs before we discuss clause 146. The hon. Gentleman made the interesting suggestion that the Electoral Commission should provide guidance not only to establish and promulgate good practice, but for accountancy practice. That is not beyond the realms of possibility. We have not had the opportunity to discuss the Electoral Commission, and I shall consider his suggestion carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>OFFICERS OF REGISTERED PARTY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 43, leave out lines 28 to 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment takes a different approach to the theme that we have been pursuing. It relates to the appointment of deputy treasurers. The Minister said that we are not talking about Mrs. Brown, who might be the treasurer or deputy treasurer of an accounting unit or local party organisation. I know that the Labour party is a reasonably slick organisation. It will enforce the Bill's provisions and investigate its treasurer and deputy treasurer to ensure that they have not committed an offence and are eligible to hold the post. The Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats will do likewise. But the Bill must be seen to be just and equitable for all political parties, whether it relates to the Conservative party and Labour party, or the Monster Raving Loony party and Wessex Regionalist party. It must be fair to the host of smaller political parties that are legitimately registered with the Electoral Commission and which may appoint deputy treasurers to run a campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of smaller parties are not unlike the problems that our local party organisations encounter. They may have to scratch around for someone in Sunderland or the Western Isles to look after their national campaign for that region. The job has to be advertised in the national press. It might be asking too much to interview candidates and check out their financial standing and references. That is not the way of the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) provides that a party treasurer commits an offence if he appoints a person as deputy treasurer of a registered party knowing that that person is not eligible. The phraseology uses "knowing", but it is easier for a full-time party treasurer, who might be a chartered accountant by profession, to take the necessary precautions to ensure that a person is eligible for appointment. The party treasurer of one of our more crackpot political parties, which have every right to operate as national political parties and have candidates in elections, may not be so wise and knowing in the ways of the world. He or she may be taken in by the slick character who comes into the office claiming that he can do this or that. Of course precautions should be taken, but in the heat of an election campaign it is unreasonable to suggest that a party treasurer has committed a criminal offence by not doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who are involved in the more mature larger political parties would regard those checks as normal, but what impact will the subsection have on smaller political parties? They have every right to conduct campaigns but, because they are run on a shoestring, their deputy treasurers may not be the people that we would choose for our parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for North Dorset will be pleased to know from the outset that I shall accept the principle of his amendment, although perhaps for reasons that were not in his speech. The hon. Gentleman will understand the language of clause 67(4), as it contains a double whammy by which both the treasurer and the deputy treasurer would be guilty of an offence. Accepting the hon. Gentleman's amendment would clarify the matter by making only one offence, but that would require a subsequent amendment in schedule 19. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment, we will take the spirit of the proposal and table the necessary amendments on Report. That would bring the Bill into line with what was discussed earlier when we debated clause 21(7); we said then that it was unlikely that any political party, whether it contained many slick willies, or was a de minimis party with real problems, would appoint a deputy treasurer knowing that he had a track record of bad form in that respect. I would be happy to accept the amendment, but for different reasons from those that were spelt out earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 44, line 20, leave out '100' and insert '250'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 91, in page 44, line 29, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment brings us back to our earlier discussion of the amount that may be spent unsupported by an invoice and receipt, and of whether an offence should then be deemed to have been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to concentrate on clause 69(2), as we have already discussed the issues raised by subsection (4), although I should like him to comment on that proposal too. There is a discrete issue in subsection (2) that we should consider in more detail; I was surprised by the precise wording, which states:
	<br><q><p>"Any payment … must be supported by an invoice and a receipt unless it is less than £100."</p></q>
My amendment proposes that the amount should be increased to £250, which is one way of dealing with the problem. Another way would be to ask whether both an invoice and a receipt were needed. The clause may go into too much bureaucratic detail; obviously, there must be some proof that expenditure was incurred and on what it was spent, but the double provision may cause difficulties when small sums are involved.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
We considered the matter when discussing an earlier clause and I do not want to take up more of the Committee's time on the subject, but I remind the Minister that the measure will apply not just to large political parties but to any registered political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot remember its status, but earlier the Minister mentioned a political party formed in the Morecambe bay area. That did not sound to me like a party that was likely to field a huge number of candidates. Nevertheless, it will face the full rigour of the Bill. Is it right that such parties should be required to produce both an invoice and a receipt? What will happen to them if they find that they do not have one or other of those items, yet they are confident that the expenditure has been incurred properly? Is £100, rather than £250, the right figure? Should the parties be penalised, as subsection (4) provides? It is not just a question of making a payment in contravention of subsection (1), without reasonable excuse, that also contravenes subsection (3), which I shall quote in full, as it is worth considering its minutiae. It states:
	<br><q><p>"Where a person within paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection (1) makes a payment to which subsection (2) applies, he must—
	<ol>
	<li>deliver to the treasurer—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>notification that he has made the payment, and</li>
	<li>the supporting invoice, 
<br><br><!-- lb -->as soon as possible after making the payment, and</li>
</ol>
	<li>deliver to the treasurer a receipt for the payment as soon as possible after receiving the receipt.</li>
</ol></p></q>
	<br><q><p>(4) A person commits an offence if—
	<ol>
	<li>he makes any payment in contravention of subsection (1), or</li>
	<li>without reasonable excuse, he contravenes subsection (3)."</li>
</ol></p></q>
For the avoidance of doubt, I repeat what I said earlier when talking about volunteers. The clause will criminalise not only the treasurer, but the volunteer in a small political party who, having gone to get the goods, forgets to bring back the receipt, fails to get hold of the supporting invoice or disposes of both of them in the wastepaper basket. Having finished his day's canvassing and campaigning, he goes to the pub, has a few pints, and finds when he gets home that his pockets are empty. He turns up the following morning and is forced to admit to the party treasurer of, for example, the Morecambe bay party or the Hazel Grove bypass party, that he has neither the receipt nor the invoice. I wonder whether the number of nervous breakdowns, let alone suicides, among treasurers of small political parties is increasing as a result of such draconian detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This seems as good a moment as any to make my point. I did not follow closely the events that led to the trial of the hon. Member for Newark (Mrs. Jones), but I understand that her appeal was upheld because, taking the matter as a whole, the court felt that any offence that might technically have been committed did not warrant the penalty of a conviction. Although we may accept the Minister's assurance that safeguards come into play before people can be prosecuted, the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument is that many cases in which technical offences have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
been committed will go to trial, but the courts will decide that convictions cannot be sustained because the punishment is disproportionate to the offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I followed the trial of the hon. Member for Newark as far as I could in the newspaper. Her subsequent appeal against conviction hinged on the way in which—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to question events involving an hon. Member of this House, who was found not guilty, by referring in part to the case? In the absence of the full facts, it appears to go dangerously close to questioning the integrity of an hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is the case, and that is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I should emphasise that I did not intend, to do any such thing. From the reports of that case, it was common knowledge that one of the issues was the difficulty of keeping track of election expenses and the whole process by which election expenses were incurred, whether by the hon. Member for Newark or by her agent. I take that case as an example because they were completely exonerated of any male fides. As I understood their explanation, they accepted that the return that was made after the election might not have fully reflected what had happened, but said that it had been done innocently, and their explanation was ultimately accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East is right, but that case related to election expenses for a single by-election and, as the Minister reminded the Committee, we are dealing with the expenses of national political parties, not individual candidates' election expenses. However, one point has a bearing on the other because, as we have discussed so many times, nationally registered parties range from the Conservative and Labour parties and, to some extent, the Liberal Democrats—huge national organisations represented in every constituency—to very small political parties, which may have problems very similar to those of an individual election candidate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I referred to a by-election, but the case of the hon. Member for Newark related to a general election campaign, not to a by-election, so she was subject to the rules relating to general election expenses. However, the problems are likely to be similar, hence my anxiety about the draconian provisions in the Bill, which do not just apply to the party treasurer but will have an impact on individual volunteers working for the party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and to the Committee that neither my hon. Friend nor I sought to question the conduct of the hon. Member for Newark, which was fully exonerated by the trial. On the contrary, we were saying that it is the sort of ordeal that people might have to experience if we introduce legislation that criminalises activities that do not deserve to be criminalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly the defence of reasonable excuse. Is it a reasonable excuse that one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
did not give the treasurer notification of a payment and the supporting invoices as soon as possible after the event because one went to the pub with one's friends and then dropped the invoice in the wastepaper basket at home and completely forgot about it? That raises an important point, to which I hope the Minister will respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I remind the Committee that the clause applies to national campaigning and national expenditure limits? There is a temptation to extend the argument to local level, but the clause is clear. If there is to be a national expenditure limit, it is clearly appropriate that there should be good accountancy practice and a good audit trail, so that the onerous tasks of the treasurer and deputy of the party can be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that that will apply to any nationally registered party, including those which operate locally and do not campaign on what one would usually describe as a national basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is indeed the case. If a party is registered it will be covered by the provisions. The hon. Gentleman asked me about a Morecambe bay political group whose name I cannot remember. I struggled with the details, but I shall find them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Morecambe Bay Independents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me of the name. Groups based by the seaside figure highly on the list of registered organisations. It must be something in the air—perhaps it is the ozone that gets them going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for a proper audit trail to be in place, and the Bill provides a mechanism for establishing it. The clause says that a payment must be supported by an invoice and receipt unless it is of less than £100. Amendment No. 90 seeks to change that threshold to £250. The provision is based on section 73 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which specifies a de minimis limit of £20. A move to £100 is, therefore, already a significant leap forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must consider whether £100 is a reasonable payment, bearing in mind that conditions may differ in different parts of the country. The norm in the constituency of North Dorset might not apply to mining districts in Sherwood. Personally, I do not think it unreasonable that the purchaser of goods to a value of £100 should obtain an invoice or pay for them and get a receipt. Sometimes the invoice and receipt will be the same document. The person who acquires the goods will obtain the receipt, which is quite permissible. Other provisions in the Bill set time limits in relation to the payment and use of invoices and receipts, which is why the clause distinguishes between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
the two and separates them. The Committee should reflect on the figure of £100, which is a matter for balance and judgment. As I have said many times during our proceedings, there are no right or wrong figures on such matters and judgments must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked me to concentrate on amendment No. 90, but he also asked me to consider amendment No. 91. That brings us to another point made earlier about the criminalisation of behaviour. I fear that we shall discuss that old chestnut several more times. As parliamentary candidates, all hon. Members are subject to restrictions. The Representation of the People Act 1983 requires us to keep accounts and to produce invoices and receipts. If such restrictions are good enough for us as candidates and for our local agents, I do not see why they should be applied at a national level. At the end of the day, we must establish a system that works and an accounting trail. If people are not prepared to comply with the rules for good practice, the ultimate sanction will be the criminal law. I suspect, however, that such cases will be few and far between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I understand Committee members' concerns, and I hope that I have explained the Government's position to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for understanding our concerns. I shall be happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I believe that progress will have to be closely monitored. I shall be interested to see what sort of discretion the Electoral Commission applies. I am anxious for Parliament to be wary of giving too much discretion to organisations whose decisions may affect the liberty of the subject through criminal sanction. I share the Minister's view that the intention behind the Bill is worthy, and I agree that it is intended not to criminalise people but to secure compliance with sets of rules that are to everybody's benefit. I wonder merely whether it matches intention with reality on the ground for many people. As I said, it will need a lot of explanation to the Morecambe Bay Independents and other such groups. I fear that smaller organisations will not have the slightest idea what they are supposed to do under the draconian sanctions and complex rules unless such explanation is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to those remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
