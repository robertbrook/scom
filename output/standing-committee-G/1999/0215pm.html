	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a short announcement about the selection list for this afternoon. New clause 4 stands on today's Amendment Paper as a starred amendment, having been tabled yesterday. In normal circumstances it could not therefore be called for debate today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I understand that it is the wish of the Committee to complete proceedings on the Bill today, and that it would accordingly be for the convenience of Members to allow the new clause to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, and if all Members are content, Mrs. Michie and I have agreed, exceptionally, that the new clause can be selected for debate today. A revised selection list has accordingly been issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 19 agreed to.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 137</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SUMMARY PROCEED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 88, line 18, leave out 'three' and insert 'two'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 137(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite anything in section 127(1) of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980, any information relating to any offence under this Act which is triable by a magistrates' court in England and Wales may be so tried if it is laid at any time within three years after the commission of the offence and within six months after the relevant date."</p></blockquote>
The Committee may be familiar with normal procedure, but the standard rule within the magistrates court is that summary only offences have usually to be laid within six months of their commission, albeit that exceptions may be made. Some provisions provide for 12 months. If a matter goes to the Crown court, the prosecution may be brought at any time thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 19, which we briefly glossed over, creates the 68 criminal offences to which I alluded yesterday. They include a substantial number of summary only offences. It is worth paying momentary attention to that provision; the offences may be those most commonly committed. For example, the schedule covers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"failure to deliver proper statement of accounts … On summary conviction: Level 5; failure to deliver accounts within time limits … On summary conviction: Level 5"</p></blockquote>
on the standard scale, and so on, including acceptance by an ineligible person of office of deputy treasurer, a subject that has been a vexed question in the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a large number of offences. Those offences, dare I say it, which are mostly likely to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
committed by, I would not say innocent people, but those who fall foul or transgress in a slight way, are, not surprisingly, not triable by a Crown court; they are summary only offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 137 provides that, unlike the usual magistrates' court rules, on which the Minister may comment in a moment, prosecutions on summary only offences can be brought up to three years after the commission of the offence and six months after the relevant date:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the date on which evidence sufficient in the opinion of the prosecutor to justify proceedings comes to his knowledge."</p></blockquote>
That ties in with my previous comment that in most road traffic offences, the information would have to be laid within six months of the commission of the offence. I am slightly concerned about that. I accept that, by its nature, the sort of audit that the Electoral Commission must carry out will mean that some time is likely to elapse between the commission of an offence and the time when the commission finds out about it. I am willing to concede that, but three years is a very long time and may cause injustice. Why do we set such time limits for relatively minor offences in the magistrates court? It is because, historically, it was considered to be unjust to prosecute people after considerable delay, and the less serious the offence, the less delay is tolerated. Obviously, a prosecution for murder in the Crown court may be brought 50 years after the crime was committed, but in relation to summary offences, the House should be reluctant to establish a system in which, three years after the event, someone may suddenly be prosecuted for potentially minor breaches, which, none the less, could have serious consequences, especially if the person is a treasurer or office holder in a political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, I substituted two years for three. I am prepared to listen to what the Minister has to say about three years, but in the absence of coherent arguments why three years are required, I would prefer two, which is already 18 months longer than applies to summary offences that are punishable only by a fine. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why three years are required in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) introduced the clause and the amendment extremely well. He explained the problem and argued that the three-year period should be reduced to two. In doing so, he acknowledged that, in such circumstances, the usual six-month period should be extended. Amendment No. 131 would reduce the period to two years. The hon. Gentleman asked me to put forward coherent arguments why the three-year period should remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will take six months for audited accounts to be returned to the commission. The commission will have a heavy work load, but it will have to review the accounts and make further inquiries about whether a prosecution should take place. If the commission decides that a prosecution should be brought, the matter must be referred to the police and to the Crown Prosecution Service. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for sufficient time in which to identify whether an offence has been committed to make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0833">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
further inquiries and, if necessary, to involve the police and CPS, before a prosecution is brought. Therefore, it is arguable whether two years is sufficient. Clearly, one should bring a prosecution as soon as possible, but three years is not unreasonable. A precedent has been set that is not far from the mark. Three years has worked well in respect of section 731 of the Companies Act 1985. It provides the opportunity for extra time. Three years is the outside limit and I do not expect people to wait that long, but the period needs to be longer than two years. The clause is in accordance with section 731 of the Companies Act 1985.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. We have examined the precedents from which the Bill is derived. It ranges over tax law and company law. I wonder whether they provide good comparables for the Bill. Company law may make similar provisions, but as we discussed with the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell), it is a long way from the Morecambe Bay Independents. It will take six months for the audited accounts to be submitted, another six months for the Electoral Commission to identify what might be wrong and a further six months to clarify whether there has been an offence or just an innocent event that it would not refer to the CPS for action. That leaves six months in my two-year timetable and 18 months in the Minister's three-year timetable. Justice delayed is justice denied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter. Three years is a long time. We need only put it in the context of political life, in which three years can put us in another age. We must also have regard to the fact that people should not unexpectedly face charges three years after an event when recollections are genuinely hazy. It could be difficult to recall what went on or who wrongly paid money to a contractor without declaring it to the treasurer for approval and putting it through the books. Such examples will crop up under summary jurisdiction. I would be grateful if the Minister mulls it over with his officials, because two years is more reasonable. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Labour Members reassure me that I have probably done my job correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments bring us back to the guilt of unincorporated associations and partnerships. The amendment would change subsection (6), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a partnership is guilty of an offence under this Act, every partner (other than a partner who is proved to have been ignorant of, or to have attempted to prevent the commission of, the offence) shall also be guilty of that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly."</p></blockquote>
That wording suggests that the burden of proof will be on the partner, who will have to prove that he falls into the categories of having been ignorant of the offence or of having attempted to prevent the commission of it. I am not generally in favour of placing burdens of proof on defendants, as they are usually on the prosecutor in English law. The amendment would make it clear that the burden of proof is on the prosecutor to show that the individual partners of a partnership that is guilty of an offence are also guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious matter. Partnerships may operate in all sorts of shapes, forms and sizes. As has been pointed out, the Bill properly allows unincorporated associations—partnerships are a form of such association, albeit with a slightly different legal personality—or partnerships to be criminally liable in their own right. Of course, such organisations cannot be locked up; they can only be fined, although those fines can be substantial. Indeed, schedule 19 shows just how substantial they are. However, the Bill goes a step further by ensuring that where a partnership is guilty of an offence, each partner shall be guilty unless he satisfies a court that the offence had nothing to do with him. I question the propriety of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aiming at a mischief and trying to stamp out improper practices. The penalties can apply to groups of people and will have serious consequences. They are not just raps over the knuckles for a road traffic offence. The offences will criminalise the individuals in question, and I assume that they will be recordable as a criminal record and will appear on people's forms. A few road traffic offences such as causing death by dangerous driving will appear in that way, but most such offences will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about the matter, and I would like to hear justification of why all partners should have collective criminal liability unless they can persuade a court otherwise. If a prosecutor decides that a partnership has committed a criminal offence, the court will probably have to deal with documentary evidence. I should have expected that such documents would be likely to identify any individual so culpable that he should be prosecuted. Will the Minister justify the arrangements? If he does not think that there is any need for such a procedure, will he revert to the ordinary rules in English law, which ensure that the burden of proof is on the prosecution at all times and it is not for the defendant to exculpate himself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 does exactly the same thing for an unincorporated association. My argument is valid for a partnership, but it is even more valid for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
unincorporated associations. Although some partnerships are loose, one would expect them usually to consist of individuals who work together regularly and who know something of each other's activities. That contrasts with unincorporated associations, which would cover every political party. Every member of the committee or other similar governing body would be guilty unless they could prove their innocence. I do not know how Labour party or Liberal Democrat party constituency associations work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Stunell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hazel Grove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor do I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I have some understanding of how my constituency association works. I know that it has an executive council, and I assume that the council is the governing body of the accounting unit that my association will become. I know how it operates, and about the voluntary nature of the relationship; it is not tied down by contract, and no one is required to turn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It beggars belief that a blanket policy should operate if a transgression is found—I hope that it will not be—so that the group is held collectively liable. The chances are that the only persons liable would be the agent, possibly the chairman and perhaps someone who had played a prominent part in an election campaign. It is nonsense to suggest that other members would know anything about a transgression. They may be able to exculpate themselves, but I doubt whether it is reasonable or proper in those circumstances that they should face prosecution, or that the prosecutor should demand that they satisfy him that they knew nothing about it. That seems a little draconian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I ask the Minister to review the provisions for unincorporated associations. It could be argued that the provisions should be maintained for partnerships, but not for unincorporated associations, although I think that partners might feel disadvantaged. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that there is a good reason for the provisions. If, having heard my arguments, he thinks that I am right, I hope that he will review the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a rare case of my being impressed by the arguments so far advanced. The amendment was beyond my ken; never having been a member of a business partnership, I could not relate to some of the issues that it raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield certainly struck a nerve when he referred to unincorporated associations. The clause certainly seems to bear the meaning that he suggests. Should that be so, I would be concerned about its ramifications. Mrs. Brown, back in her little branch committee, might find that she has crossed the line. Subsection (1) seems to apply not only to some offences but to any alleged offence. That might visit wrath on a branch committee or constituency executive that goes beyond the bounds of what seems reasonable. An amendment that placed the burden on the prosecuting authorities rather than making the defendants prove that they were ignorant of or had attempted to prevent the commission of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
offence would seem appropriate. I shall listen to the Minister's response with some interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield rightly pointed out that amendment No. 132 relates to partnership, and amendment No. 133 to unincorporated associations. Both have the same effect and intention. The clause is modelled on a precedent—section 734 of the Companies Act 1985. We should focus on amendment No. 133, because the majority of cases will relate to political parties and pressure groups that are unincorporated associations. Subsections (6) and (7) of clause 139 make provisions for individual partners or officers, or certain members of an unincorporated association to be found individually guilty of an offence when the body itself has been found guilty of an offence. An offence will have been committed by the body; proceedings will then be taken separately against individual members. That may be appropriate if individual officers or the management committee as a whole has authorised expenditure in contravention of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield, as always, has put his finger on it: the amendment seeks to reverse the burden of proof. I am not inclined to promise a new amendment, but I shall certainly reflect on the matter. Interestingly enough, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove came to the same conclusion. The Bill was drafted in that way because a person charged under the provisions of subsections (6) or (7) may escape conviction if he can prove either that he was ignorant of the offence or that he had attempted to prevent the commission of the offence. The first test is that the body has been found guilty. The second test is that the individual challenged was ignorant of the offence or had attempted to prevent it from being committed. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, the amendment would reverse the burden of proof in respect of the first of the two defences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would describe it as restoring the burden of proof. Normally, the burden of proof falls on the prosecution. However, the amendment is changing the system as it would apply under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members are always keen to put their amendments in the best light. The hon. Gentleman has done so again. He is right that the amendment would change the burden of proof; it would fall to the prosecution to show that a defendant was not ignorant of the commission of the offence with which he was being charged. The question is whether the defendant or the prosecutor should deliver the burden of proof. The Bill places the responsibility on the defendant. As I said, I am not giving a firm commitment, but having heard the arguments, I shall certainly reflect on the words of the amendment. During the debate it has become apparent that the provision is phrased rather differently than originally drafted. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to reconsider the wording—to see whether we can protect those people and give them some reassurance—and withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured that the Minister will reconsider the matter. I accept that it is not completely clear cut. I do not suggest that the Government have done something disgraceful in making such a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0835">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
provision. The burden of proof is sometimes reversed. The Minister pointed out that the clause is derived from the Companies Acts, but the activities of company directors are a million miles away from the activities of Mrs. Brown and her unincorporated association. We need to think carefully about associations or parties that raise enough money to qualify in light of the realities rather than the precedent of the Companies Acts.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) and I had had another day to consider the clauses in Committee, we would have tabled an amendment to clause 146, but I shall be able to deal with it perfectly well in a clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am struck by the definition of a qualified auditor in line 15 of page 92. The role is defined in a way that
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
causes me no difficulty at first, but in lines 22 to 25 we are told that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person is not a qualified auditor in relation to any registered party or any other body or individual if he is—
	<ol>
	<li>a member of the party or body or the individual himself, or</li>
	<li>an officer or employee of the party, body or individual."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I do not see that as presenting any great difficulty in dealings with large political parties. I hope that the Conservative party has its accounts audited by a professional firm of accountants, but it is open to considerable doubt as to whether it knows if those in the organisation who perform the audit are members of the party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee difficulties in dealing with accounting units. I have not double-checked, but I am fairly certain that the audit of my association is carried out on a non-commercial basis by a member of the association—not an officer of the association, and certainly not the treasurer, but someone sufficiently well qualified, and almost certainly a chartered accountant, who does it out of the kindness of his heart. Circumstances may vary. The finances of some associations or accounting units may be so complex that the job must be done on a commercial basis. The requirement that the person involved must not be a member of the party is excessively onerous and, if the person involved is a qualified auditor, completely unnecessary. I hope that the Minister will consider that. The Bill will add a cost burden for political parties. Instead of spending their money—which they will have enough difficulty raising under the Bill—on campaigning, they will have to spend it on having their accounts professionally audited, instead of making use of services available in the wider membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Julian Lewis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(New Forest, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it more likely that, to save money, the member of the local party who has audited the accounts until now will simply give up his subscription and cease to be a member of the party, thus observing the letter of the law but not its spirit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I can envisage that happening, and it would show the absurdity of the provision. It is not absurd to specify that an officer or employee of the party should not be responsible for the audit—I fully accept that—but to deny a member of the party the right to carry out the audit, which he probably does at a reduced rate or free of charge, is unwarranted and will benefit no one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An important and interesting point has been raised towards the end of our proceedings. As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause defines and identifies qualified auditors and provides that no party member may audit his own party's accounts. Clearly, that provision has been included to give the lie to charges of avoidance and evasion. I have a great deal of sympathy for small ward and constituency parties, and will reconsider the matter. However, during our proceedings, it has been identified that qualified auditors will be necessary only when either income or expenditure exceeds £250,000. It is not unreasonable in those circumstances to involve a qualified auditor and specify that he should not be involved in the party. The hon. Gentleman made a fair
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0836">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
point, but the proviso that the provision will apply only when relatively large sums—£250,000—are involved sets the matter in context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had forgotten that the limit was £250,000. That colours and reinforces the Minister's viewpoint, but the matter is nevertheless worth reconsideration. One constituency association of the Conservative party might fall foul of the provisions, but it is not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the person involved is a qualified auditor, the question whether he is a member of a party seems rather irrelevant. There might be some uncertainty about whether the association knew that the auditor was a member of the same political party. If he were working locally but was a member of another association in a neighbouring constituency, the association would have no idea. I suppose that all chartered accountants would have to receive notification saying that they cannot audit the accounts of the party of which they are a member, but that seems complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 93, line 6, after '(7)', insert '(7A)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 137, in page 93, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7A) The Secretary of State may by order amend the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2000, to extend the provision of Part IX to Northern Ireland'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, the amendment seems like a variation on a theme of amendments relating to Northern Ireland. However, it is about consistency. I was discussing matters with the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), last week when she said that such amendments could be not part of the Bill because, at that stage, powers were delegated to the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, given that the Northern Ireland Act 2000 is now on the statute book, I am not sure whether such advice is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee to clause 48 on permissible donors, subsection (2)(b) of which refers to a company
	<br><blockquote><p>"registered under the Companies Act 1985 or the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would insert into clause 147 a new subsection (7A), which would bring the provisions of subsections (6) and (7) into being in Northern Ireland by giving the Secretary of State the power under the proposed subsection (7A) that he may
	<br><blockquote><p>"by order amend the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2000, to extend the provision of Part IX to Northern Ireland".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make the provisions entirely consistent for two reasons. First, it would give some meaning to clause 48. If part IX of the Bill is not put into effect in Northern Ireland, clause 48 will not stand
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
up because the Electoral Commission will no longer have any jurisdiction over companies registered under the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 as that power will have been vested in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, given that the Northern Ireland Assembly has now been suspended by the Northern Ireland Act 2000, not only the amendments to the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986—which was passed in the House, not in the Northern Ireland Assembly—but any subsequent business relating to Northern Ireland, will be matters for the House, not the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also occurred to me that the original provisions granting all powers relating to companies in Northern Ireland may not have been the correct procedure for us to adopt when considering matters relating to political parties, elections and referendums. We have debated at length in Committee donations to political parties in Northern Ireland and expenses of Northern Ireland parties and it is right that we should make the Bill consistent throughout so that the transparency that is required, under part IX, of companies in England, Wales and Scotland should be extended to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Act 2000, which was enacted last week, gives that power and we should amend the Bill to take account of that legislation. That would create a much better Bill that is consistent and transparent and enforces the same rules across the United Kingdom. That is entirely right and I hope that the Minister will feel that the amendment should be made, even at this late stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made two points with which I agree. The first was on Northern Ireland and the new situation there, which has occupied a great deal of the Committee's time. As the Bill proceeds, we will doubtless insert different and better provisions into it. The second point was indisputable. The Committee discussed a similar matter last week when the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), told the Committee that companies legislation had been devolved in Northern Ireland since 1922. In a sense, that remains the case, although there have been dramatic changes in Northern Ireland since the Committee last met. The Northern Ireland Act 2000 now vests those powers not in the Assembly but in the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who would be able to make changes by Order in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate way to tackle Northern Ireland legislation is by the Secretary of State introducing an Order in Council. Changes may need to be made before Report stage. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but nothing of substance has changed. Companies law remains devolved but is handled by the Secretary of State. Changes to companies law should occur through that means rather than through the Committee. I accept that the situation is fluid and give an undertaking that we will return to the subject of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was almost reciting back to me the amendment:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order amend the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2000"</p></blockquote>
That implements just what we wish to achieve. The reason for incorporating that into the Bill is to give the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland some guidance as to how to achieve consistency between the practice in companies legislation in England, Wales and Scotland and that in Northern Ireland. It would be right to bring them in line with each other, as I think the Minister agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the Minister disagrees about incorporating a piece of legislation relating to England, Wales and Scotland that places a burden on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in respect of a devolved matter. However, the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 was laid before the House, not the Northern Ireland Assembly, and other Orders in Council were laid before the House. Therefore, I am content to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that the situation in Northern Ireland might be clarified a little before the Bill is considered on Report, and that the Minister or the Opposition might produce a more appropriate amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 is important. More than the other new clauses that we have considered on the Bill, it goes to the heart of our democratic process and the party system. It would introduce tax relief at the basic rate of tax on political donations up to £500 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording is based on the mortgage interest relief at source and gift aid schemes, so it has some tax precedents. Those of us in Opposition have never believed that we should cherry-pick the Neill recommendations; in our view they should be implemented in full, so far as possible, which is what the new clause would do. I shall refer to the Neill report in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face a choice between whether we want political parties to be directly funded by taxpayers—I know that some members of the Committee sympathise with that view—or whether we want to implement a procedure to encourage more voluntary donations to political parties. The new clause would encourage voluntary donations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In evidence to the Neill committee, the Conservative party stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rather than call for state funding we would welcome the Committee's views about how more individuals could be encouraged to donate. We note that in some countries individuals are offered tax relief for political donations, elsewhere tax credits or matching grants are provided. We believe that the Committee should give serious consideration to the practicalities of these approaches in the context of the UK's voluntary system."</p></blockquote>
The Neill committee's recommendations are set out in our new clauses. It is important in the interests of democracy that the funding of political parties is as broadly based as possible. Neill goes on to cite evidence from Germany about a system of tax relief introduced in 1974 under which the pattern of donations to political parties has changed from large donations to many small ones, which is in keeping with the spirit of the new clause and the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is identical to one tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) on 22 June 1999 in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
Standing Committee considering the Finance Bill. It would amend section 379 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 by inserting a new section, 379AA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Neill's recommendation 38 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tax relief by deduction at source should be introduced, limited to the basic rate, on donations of up to £500 a year to 'eligible' registered political parties."</p></blockquote>
He went on to specify in recommendation 39:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Political parties should be eligible to claim under the tax relief scheme if at the last general election two members of the party were elected to the House of Commons or one member was elected and the party won at least 150,000 votes."</p></blockquote>
Why do we feel that it would be appropriate to include what seems to be a taxation measure in the Bill? The then Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), said in response to my hon. Friend's amendment to the Finance Bill in June 1999:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government do not believe that that it is the appropriate way to respond to the Neill committee, which proposed a package of recommendations that should be considered together. That is why I shall ask the Committee to reject the new clause.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The question of whether there should be tax relief for donations to political parties—and, if so, how it should operate—must be considered alongside all the proposed measures that we intend to publish in the draft Bill before the summer. We should not try to deal with this one aspect in isolation.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is also necessary to consider the issue of tax relief for donations to political parties alongside the review of tax relief for charitable donations—something that we are already working on with the charitable sector. It would be most unfortunate if the system appeared to be more generous in relation to smaller donations to political parties than in relation to smaller donations to charities."</p></blockquote>
The new clause takes note of that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I urge hon. Members to await publication of our draft Bill on donations to political parties and campaign expenditure. I hope that, in the spirit of fraternity—"</p></blockquote>
which I hope exists in this Committee, too—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which characterised at least some of his responses to my earlier requests of this kind in Committee, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will agree to withdraw the new clause. He might do so in the spirit of fraternity that has characterised at least some of his responses to similar requests that I have previously made of him".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 22 June 1999; c. 778.]</p></blockquote>
It is, therefore, the Treasury's view that the new clause should be considered as part of the Bill, and not in isolation. That is why, although the new clause was tabled in a Standing Committee considering the Finance Bill, it was felt that it should be taken not in isolation, but alongside this Bill. As the Minister will be aware, having arguments for and against, Lord Neill concludes in favour of a system of tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Razzell, the treasurer of the Liberal Democrat party in his evidence to the Neill committee, saw benefit in the tax relief system. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that as a weapon for the political parties to build up their membership base in particular … as part of that armoury as long as it was structured in a way that was designed to benefit the small donations, I wouldn't be against it."</p></blockquote>
Lord Parkinson, giving evidence on behalf of the Conservative party, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that this is a very attractive idea. I think anything that encourages people to participate in the political process, to get involved in political parties, to broaden the base of their membership
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0839">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
is to be welcomed because I think politics is a very honourable profession and supporting a political party is a very worthwhile way of spending one's time and money."</p></blockquote>
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to say that there were not arguments against the measure. In his evidence, the finance director of the Labour party, Mr. David Pitt-Watson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tax relief is of value only to people who pay tax"—</p></blockquote>
that is true—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and where the donations given are of a significant size. It would be of little value to the Labour Party, which has 400,000 members who are paying an average £20 each to the Labour Party's coffers. It would be of enormous value to our opponents."</p></blockquote>
The Minister will know that, as well as those giving the Labour party an average of £20, many donors give it much more than that. It is with some sadness that I know for a fact that the Labour party has more donors who give more than £5,000 than the Conservative party has. I imagine that some of those donors would value a small tax concession. We are not aiming at those who give £20, nor at those who donate £5,000, but at those who want to make a significant contribution—significant in their own terms. I am talking about those on middle incomes who consider that making a substantial donation to a political party is worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Conservative association has a successful patrons club, members of which make donations of £200. They are obviously content to do that at the moment without the benefit of tax relief. We would be in a much healthier state if we did have tax relief, however, given that more people might be inclined to make such a donation to the party. The Liberal Democrats would benefit from that, too, as would the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would bring many small to medium-sized donors into the political process, It is not concerned with those who pay their basic subscription, or with those who can write out cheques for £5,000 or up to £1 million. They would make contributions anyway and the tax relief on, say, £500 would be minimal. We want to aim for people who already make charitable donations using the gift aid scheme of up to £500 and are encouraged to do so by the tax relief granted on those donations. We could enable political parties to broaden the base of their finances, so that they are less reliant on the large donors of more than £5,000, including some who donate £1 million or more. We want political parties to become more broadly based in their financing sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that such a scheme would constitute a great fillip for democracy in this country and would be of minimal cost to the Treasury. I say that advisedly, having looked at the costs of other political activities, even some that we have alluded to in the Bill. In comparison with the cost of special advisers alone, which is a burden on the taxpayer, this is a modest money measure and it is entirely appropriate that it should come at the end of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Linton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is also entirely appropriate that we are broaching for the first time, as we come towards the end of our proceedings, the issue of state funding in political parties, which has been a taboo subject for so long. Indeed, for the past 30 years the Conservative party has refused to contemplate any form of state funding—one can date it precisely from when Lord McAlpine became treasurer of the Conservative party in March 1976. The line has always been that the Conservatives would refuse to contemplate state funding, which is why the Houghton committee set up by the previous Labour Government ran into the sand; it was not even debated in the House of Commons because the Prime Minister of the day believed that it needed all-party support and knew that the Conservatives would never support it, so it was quietly dropped, even though it came up with some enlightened proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have an ironic situation. The Labour party supported state funding in our 1987 manifesto, our 1992 manifesto and the evidence that we gave to the Home Affairs Committee in 1994. Now, the Conservative party supports, for the first time, an outright measure of state funding and a Labour Government oppose it. If one asks, "Well, hang on, is tax relief really state funding?" I would point out what the Neill report says on state funding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In chapter 7, we considered the issue of the funding of political parties … directly out of public funds. In this chapter, we look at the question of funding political parties through tax concession, which will divert monies which would otherwise go to the Revenue."</p></blockquote>
The Neill committee clearly made no distinction: it regarded tax relief as indirect state funding—I hope that that does not embarrass the Opposition because they still have something of a taboo: they do not want to use the words "state funding", but that is of course what it would be. I do not think the worse of it for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should face up to the fact that every other European country, and North America, uses some form of state funding for political parties. We have many indirect forms of state funding for political parties. Payments in kind, freepost, party political broadcasts, the free hire of school halls, Short money, Cranbourne money and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy Ltd, are all essentially forms of state funds that are paid, one way or another, to political parties. A tax relief system would probably be the most direct form so far, although since the 1970s we have had tax relief on bequests to political parties, which has never caused so much as an eyebrow to be raised. That is exactly the same as tax relief, but on inheritance rather than gifts. Tax relief has been paid on donations to political parties for 25 years, since 1974—the only difference being that so far it has been simply on bequests, not gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Neill committee gives three different forms of tax relief: the tax check-off, the tax credit and straightforward tax relief. If it were possible to have a tax check-off or a tax credit, there would be far more sympathy for the idea on the Labour Benches, but the Inland Revenue, in its evidence to the Neill committee, said that the tax check-off and the tax credit were not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
"administratively practical" in this country, for reasons that I find difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Canada, if one makes a $100 donation to a political party and sends the receipt to the tax authorities, they take $75 off one's tax liability. Although many people in this country do not fill out annual tax returns, it is possible, by changing their tax codes, to repay money due to them in the form of tax credits. I do not need to tell my hon. Friends that the advantage of a tax credit is that it is worth the same to every taxpayer: in fact it is worth more, the smaller the amount, to counteract the fact that tax relief is more valuable not only the more one gives but the higher one's tax rate. Tax credit takes care of that and is just as valuable in respect of small donations. In Canada one gets 75 per cent. tax relief on the first $100, 50 per cent. on the next $450 and 33.3 per cent. on the next $600. Therefore, the bias works in completely the opposite direction from tax relief, which helps the big donor, more. The tax credit helps the small donor. It is a shame that the Neill committee should have accepted so supinely the Inland Revenue's advice that tax credits are not possible in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in a position to propose tax credits here and now, but I wanted to point to the need for a proper debate about state funding. We must drop the pretence that it does not happen in this country and the school playground attitude, "If you do it, we'll accuse you of taking taxpayers' money and if we do it, you'll accuse us". That has been the attitude so far, but we should be honest enough to recognise that it has been going on for many years. Taxpayers do not seem to mind it. If they were asked in an opinion poll, they would object, but if one asks, "Have you anything against freepost?" or "Have you anything against tax relief on bequests?", they do not seem to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were an emerging consensus between the parties to address the issue of state funding in a non-point-scoring way, we could make rapid progress. At the moment we are in this strange crossover situation where the Conservative party, having opposed state funding for 30 years, now supports it and the Labour party, having supported it for 30 years, now opposes it. It would be in the interests of all political parties if we could make progress towards a form of state funding that is acceptable to the parties and to the taxpayer. Tax relief would not be acceptable, simply because it gives higher rewards to higher rate taxpayers. Canada rejected tax relief from the start and opted for tax credits, for that reason. Although Germany, another country that has been quoted, started a system of tax relief that was ruled out by the constitutional court in Karlsruhe, simply because it rewarded higher rate taxpayers more than lower rate taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the concept of rewarding higher rate taxpayers, because the essence of the gift aid scheme is that it is not the taxpayer who gets the extra money, but the political party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Linton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that is shorthand. It certainly allows the higher rate taxpayer to obtain more donation for his money. The money clearly goes to the political party, but the higher rate taxpayer's donation becomes more effective. Canadian parties
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
send out their mailshots on this basis, "You pay $100 and we'll get $175." Alternatively, they put it the other way round, saying, "If you want to donate $100, you only have to give us $40 and we'll get the rest from the tax authorities."
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However one looks at that, it is a benefit. With tax relief, the more one earns and the higher the rate of tax one pays, the greater the benefit, whereas a tax credit would be more beneficial in cases involving donors of small amounts and lower rate taxpayers. The system was ruled unconstitutional in Germany for that reason, and a scheme had to be introduced to compensate parties with smaller donors, such as the Social Democrats, for the money that they lost by virtue of the advantage held by higher rate taxpayers. If such schemes were to be introduced in this country, they would have to start from a basis of complete fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by referring to two rather engaging touches in new clause 4. The first is proposed new subsection 2(d), which states that a donation qualifies if
	<br><blockquote><p>"the donor is resident in the United Kingdom at the time the donation is made."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the hon. Gentlemen's conversion to my views on tax exiles, because that is exactly the point that I tried to make during our deliberations on clause 48. Residence in this country should be a precondition for making donations for two reasons. One is that people not resident in this country should not bankroll our elections; the other is that nonresidents would not be subject to the provisions in clause 54 that would allow us to discover whether they were being used as a conduit for overseas donors. The Conservative party seems to have taken these points on board. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take note that support for the importance of residence is growing. Perhaps he will persuade his right hon. and honourable Friends that it should be made a condition of donorship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point to which I draw the Committee's attention is new clause 4(3)(a), which states that a political party is eligible if, at the previous general election:
	<br><blockquote><p>"two members of that party were elected to the House of Commons".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Minister will remember that I made the point yesterday in relation to policy development grants that that should be the definition of a political party, and that no stipulations should be added as to whether those two Members of Parliament had taken the oath. I welcome the support implicit in those two proposed new subsections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot support the proposals for tax relief. However, I hope that the Committee will take note that, for the first time in 30 years, we have the possibility of a consensus on a scheme for tax credits, or something similar, that would allow political parties to redirect their fundraising away from millionaire donors and away from a dependence on a small number of large donations that renders parties vulnerable to a perception of corruption or of being
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
beholden to individual donors. Instead, parties could move towards a system of fundraising that relied on a large number of small donors. That is what every party wants, but we need an incentive to embed it in our party system. A tax credit system would be the best way to make it easier for parties to raise funds from small donors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that we have the opportunity to debate this issue. It is a pity that we were not able to table amendments to the new clause, because it contains a number of attractive features and a number of defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the view of the Liberal Democrats in the House and elsewhere that there should be a measure of state funding for political parties. The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) made the point well that it has been creeping in little by little, 	<i>de facto,</i> to our democratic system. It would be better if we had a more upfront discussion and established some principles, after which, I hope, a consensus view would emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in the Chamber yesterday and in previous sittings that we must face up to the fact that if we do not have state funding or large donors, but are to promote the participation of the public in our democratic processes, we must stimulate the process in some way. In the absence of a miracle solution, we shall provide that stimulus through state prompting or funding, and in that regard the new clause has something to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a long new clause, and I cannot pretend to have mastered all of its details. I have struggled to understand fully whether proposed new subsections (4) and (6) mean that the tax benefit would be paid to the political party or whether it could be claimed by an individual. At one stage, the debate suggested the first option but at another it suggested the latter option. It would be paradoxical if state funding primarily benefited the taxpayer rather than the party to which the donation was made. I hope that the hon. Member for North Dorset will explain whether the provisions are intended to parallel the charitable donations scheme or whether another proposal is involved. Will the tax benefit be reclaimable by the charity or the individual? Perhaps I have not penetrated the new clause's wording adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that a degree of match funding will be involved—the figure is currently 22 per cent, but I believe that it will presently be reduced. I welcome that initiative. The £500 figure in any year of assessment does not appear to match the criteria to which we referred in earlier debates. If the figure had been amendable, I should have proposed a new figure of £200, which is the sum for what we might call invisible donations to political parties. That might overcome one of the problems that the hon. Member for Battersea mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new subsection (4) appears to state that only basic rate income tax will be recoverable. That would to some extent mitigate the evil of rich donors getting a bigger benefit than poor donors. A suitable
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
way forward might involve a lower ceiling that matched the £200 level of invisibility that is referred to elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is an eligible registered political party? If we need to discuss that in detail, I should raise some serious issues. Neill was prayed in aid by the hon. Member for North Dorset, who has suggested, on other occasions, that we should not slavishly adhere to Neill. I agree with his latter view. It is one thing to argue that support for policy development should be limited to those parties that are represented in Parliament, but in the Chamber we also discussed whether a necessary qualification for receiving money would involve sitting in Parliament. That also raises issues about what such policy development is for. Such tax deductible donations are for any or all of the work of a political party. It is not clear why we should restrict the giving of tax deductible donations only to parties that have been elected to Parliament. The Bill should state that any registered party should be capable of receiving such donations. It would seem a little perverse and contrary to our discussion. Commendably generous thought has been given to those 90 parties that are not represented in Parliament, and how they would observe the accountancy rules and various inhibitions that the Bill would impose. To be solicitous on their behalf to that extent, and then to say that only the big boys can have tax deductible donations, is not in the spirit of that discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who tabled the new clause are on the right track, and I was sorry that the Bill did not have a provision broadly along those lines. However, the detail of the new clause is flawed. The level of donation is too high, and I am not sure whether I have clearly understood where the tax benefit will lie. Will it lie with the party or the donor? Perhaps that will be clarified later in the debate, but it is a mistake to restrict the benefit, if given, only to those parties whose members have been elected to Parliament, or having generated 150,000 votes. The Morecambe Bay Residents Association or the Hazel Grove Action Group will never get 150,000 votes. If they did, some hon. Members would have something to worry about. What is the logic for saying that those people would be ineligible for such support, while those of us sitting in this Committee would be eligible? I do not know whether Conservative Members will press the new clause to a vote. I am sympathetic to the principle of it, but I could not support it in the form in which it has ben tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to speak on this matter at length. My hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset has already done so in presenting the new clause, which is akin to a discussion document. We would be the first to accept that aspects of it could be improved or changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove raised the delicate issue of whether parties without a Member of Parliament or 150,000 votes should be excluded. I share the hon. Gentleman's view that the new clause may be deficient in that regard. As my hon. Friend explained, it was tabled previously during consideration of the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0842">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
I was a little puzzled by some of the comments of the hon. Member for Battersea about state funding of political parties. The moment that the state starts to forgo its tax take, one can argue that it is conferring a benefit. That is slightly different from the state funding political parties. The parties represented in Parliament receive Short money, so most of us are substantial beneficiaries of some state funding, which is probably becoming an increasingly important element. The justification is that it is funding for the conduct of the party's parliamentary business, instead of its wider aims, which, arguably, is a grey area. The public seem to accept that reasonable state funding should be provided, through Short money, to enable parties represented in Parliament to operate. From time to time, my fares to and from Scotland—to do party business as opposed to parliamentary business—are paid from Short money. I receive a cheque through the post from the party treasurer, for which I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we may follow such a course, I have always been much more dubious about the merits of direct state funding for political parties. Indeed, I see that as presenting insurmountable obstacles in terms of the parties that qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, although some people in this country might get upset about tax concessions for funding certain political parties and consider it to be an issue that might cause considerable public anger, on the whole it is more acceptable for the state to forgo a tax take because the registered party gets money than for the state to fund the parties directly. After all, the state confers benefits on charitable organisations. While 95 per cent. of charities commend themselves to me, the activities of a number of charities are such these days that I would not favour their receiving any benefit from the state, but I dare say that members of the public may take a similarly jaundiced view about the activities of charities that I support. The general public will probably be prepared to live with state funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Charlotte Atkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Staffordshire, Moorlands)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about party political broadcasts? The hon. Gentleman has not referred to them, but clearly they are simply free advertising for a particular party, which must surely be seen as state support for political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the financial position is, but 1 accept that it is a benefit conferred on certain political parties—not all—which appears to command widespread acceptance. However, there is a difference between that and the state saying, "We will give to one political party £3 million a year, but to another political party £500,000 a year", when the criterion is not based, as it is with Short money, on the level of representation in Parliament. One gets into the difficult area of what happens to political parties that are not represented in Parliament, which can legitimately say, "This is not for parliamentary activity but for campaigning on a wider platform, and we must start from somewhere."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The merit of the clause is that it starts from the notion of public support. State funding or support by way of tax concessions does not begin until a member
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
of the public dips his hand into his pocket, and says "I am prepared to support this party and give it cash." The fact that the limit is set at £500 prevents one single, very wealthy donor from dipping his hand into his pocket and claiming massive tax benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove would say that £500 is the wrong figure and that it should be £200. Again, I am fairly neutral on that issue: if the sum or the limit is so small, the benefit being conferred will be small as well. If we are trying to encourage people to fund political parties by dipping into their pockets to a reasonable extent, £500 strikes me as being better than £200.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought that if we were to go down the road of state subsidy—an expression that I do not like—I would prefer it to be done by tax concessions than by direct state funding. I should be interested to hear how the Minister reacts to this proposal, granted that it is at an early and tentative stage and has been suggested as a topic for discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Dorset took us fairly and properly through the arguments in the Neill committee report, and I make no complaint about that. The only complaint that I would make in passing is about his accusation that it would be improper to cherry-pick the recommendations. I acknowledge that this is one of the few recommendations not acted on by the Government, but it is not the only one. He should not be surprised at the Government's lack of enthusiasm about putting such a provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government responded to Neill with the draft Bill in July 1999, which spelt out our intention not to pursue this route. Subsequently, the Neill committee wrote to Ministers asking them to reconsider the matter, and pressed the Home Office in particular on the administrative costs of the scheme. An effort has been made to gauge the cost to the Inland Revenue of setting up and administering a scheme such as that set out in the new clause. At a rough estimate, it would cost between £700,000 and £1.1 million in the first year, and between £500,000 and £700,000 in subsequent years, depending on which scheme is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of this afternoon's discussion concerned the administrative costs that would be incurred by political parties in setting up such schemes. Given the cost to the Inland Revenue and to political parties, the provisional take from such a scheme would be between £4 million and £5 million. One is forced to speculate whether such a scheme would provide value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will be aware of the more general argument about state funding of political parties—an area in which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea takes an interest. It has been acknowledged that, in a sense, state funding for political parties is nothing new. Reference has been made to Short money and the generous and sensible—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I often say to my hon. Friends that such matters go round in circles. Those of us who have been in opposition know the benefits of a proper amount of Short money. I make no bones about my delight at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
reaching a generous agreement for a 270 per cent. increase, which satisfied all parties. I wish that such generosity had been extended earlier on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will introduce new provisions for the funding of political parties, and £2 million will be made available for policy development grants. As I have said, state funding is nothing new and the Bill takes an extra step in that direction, but in the Government's opinion, a further step towards tax concessions would not be appropriate at this stage. Hard decisions have to be taken on spending priorities. As I listen to debates in the Chamber, demands are continually made for extra funding. There seems to be a majority view across the House that, if extra funding is available, it should be allocated to education and health. In the light of that view, the Government do not intend to adopt such a scheme at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that he would have liked to amend the new clause, and there are problems associated with not merely the amount but the beneficiaries. I accept that it is a cockshy, but money would normally be available to parties with two members or one member in the House of Commons that were elected with no fewer than 150,000 votes at the previous general election. I have some sympathy with environmental concerns and can imagine that green parties might feel badly treated. However, that is a point of detail and at this stage we are arguing about a point of principle. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove might not have had an opportunity to table amendments today, but I am sure that the Committee and the House will return to this matter because it is important. The Government have taken a firm view on the issue, which there is no point even promising to reflect on, Mr. Maxwell—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken a firm view and given their response to the Neill report in the White Paper.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that, after the spirit of co-operation in which the Bill has been considered, the Minister does not feel able to make any concession on this point, although I suspect that we shall return to it at a later stage, in relation either to the Bill or to other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea kept referring to higher rate taxpayers. In fact, the amendment specifically relates to basic rate tax relief. He chuckled when he referred to someone who is resident for tax purposes being able to obtain tax relief. It is legitimate that someone should have to be resident in the United Kingdom to be eligible for tax relief. If someone were paying tax to Spanish or Belgian authorities, it would be inappropriate for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
Inland Revenue to grant that person relief against income tax paid in that country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Battersea and for Hazel Grove asked whether the provision did not in fact amount to state funding. I suppose that, in the broadest sense, it could be considered to be some form of state assistance, but surely that is far better than a handout to political parties, because it includes an incentive element; the more the political party can raise from individual donors, the more tax relief it will receive. That will have a stimulative effect on political party financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would also be my answer to the Minister's objection that it would take money from elsewhere if the Treasury were to grant this concession. The stimulative effect on what is a form of economic activity in political parties of having a larger sum of money available could encourage us all to employ more party agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is employing a very Keynesian argument, of which I thoroughly approve.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In talking about the stimulative effects of tax policy, I pray in aid Lady Thatcher who was all for reducing the tax burden to get the British economy going.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the technical matter that was raised by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He was not clear who was getting the tax relief. Proposed new section 379AA(6) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person by whom a qualifying donation is received shall be entitled to recover from the Board"—</p></blockquote>
of the Inland Revenue—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with regulations, an amount which by virtue of subsection (5) … is treated as income tax paid by him; and any amount so recovered shall be treated for the purposes of the Tax Acts in like manner as the qualifying political donation to which it relates."</p></blockquote>
Proposed new section 379AA(4) allows the individual who makes the donation to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"entitled, on making the payment, to deduct and retain out of it a sum equal to the basic rate tax thereon";</p></blockquote>
but that basic rate tax has been paid to the Inland Revenue, so he is not making a gain. It comes back to the political party under the provisions of proposed new section 379AA(5) and (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Battersea mentioned a small drafting error because we did not add the qualification that the two Members of Parliament should take the oath. Had the Minister been prepared to accept the new clause, we would have suggested that he redraft it to make it consistent with the Bill. I take on board the points about one member of the party who is elected on not less than 150,000 votes and the Green party. The new clause is probing but warrants the Government's serious consideration. If the Minister is unable to accept it and cannot give us any comfort, I

Devolved matters have featured strongly in the Committee. The Scottish Parliament and Executive were mentioned. Those of us who do not know about such things wonder whether they talk to each other. I know that you, Mr. Maxton, and your co-Chairman have views on that which you cannot express. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) also has an opinion and, in his normal good humour, has made some incisive points.

I thank the Clerk and the staff of the Committee, who have been very helpful to us and extremely flexible in their approach. I am also grateful to the hon.

Finally, let me thank some unseen actors in the Committee: the Hazel Grove Action Group who will figure in my memory for a long time, as will Mrs. Brown.

Friends the Members for Beaconsfield and for New Forest East (Dr. Lewis) and the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day). I thank the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Bradford, South and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, if only for bringing us news of the Hazel Grove Action Group which, if it achieves 150,000 votes, will have a representative in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by thanking the hon. Member for Battersea, my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East and the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for their interesting amendments, which set the Committee thinking on several issues. I have enjoyed serving on the Committee and I hope that tomorrow on the Floor of the House and on Report the Government will appreciate our constructive opposition and that we will have a Bill on political parties, elections and referendums, and especially on their funding, of which Members on both sides of the House can feel proud. The Committee wanted to produce a Bill that is financially transparent and will bring financial propriety to our affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to join the Minister and the hon. Member for North Dorset in expressing my thanks to you, Mr. Maxton, and to Mrs. Michie for chairing the Committee. I also express my thanks to the officers who have serviced the Committee and kept us well briefed and well informed throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I especially thank the Minister, who reflected so often that I wondered if he were a mirror rather than a Minister. We appreciate the fact that throughout the Committee he was willing to consider the Bill from first principles and to listen to our criticisms. I thank him, too, for his assurances, which we look forward to being fulfilled, and for the occasional outright concession, which is always welcome on the parched Opposition Benches.

I extend my thanks to the other members of the Committee. The Bill has been contested in good spirits. I learned a lot from the hon. Member for North Dorset this afternoon about his patrons; there may be some patrons in Hazel Grove before long. I learned, too, from the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, that the houses in his constituency have not patios but grounds. We heard that a turnover of £250,000 has not been reached but is achievable, he thinks. Those are distant lands, glimpsed from afar by those in Hazel Grove. It has been good occasionally to find common cause against some of the slightly less adventurous Government traits that the Bill revealed. It remains to be seen whether we can nudge them forward. It is a

	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
nice thought that the real problem on the Floor of the House is that members of the Committee cannot control the rest of their colleagues but that is not the problem that we shall face. I look forward to the remaining stages of the Bill and I hope that our good spirits can be continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the only occasion when the Chairman can make even a short speech. I add my thanks to the Clerk, without whom no Chairman can operate, for the very efficient way in which he handled the Bill. Some Chairmen think that they can work without a Clerk, but that is not true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff, the Badge Messengers and the police; I am sure that those who are here will pass on our thanks to those who have also been present during our proceedings. I will pass on Members' thanks to Mrs. Ray Michie and I express my thanks to members of the Committee for the honour of being their Chairman.

There is some dispute about what Scottish Members do in the House these days; perhaps Ray
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
Michie and I prove that there is still something for us to do. I point out to the Minister that Scottish bodies tend to be buried in motorways in Glasgow, not in patios.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enjoyed the Committee's proceedings. I like being a Chairman, but oddly enough I have especially enjoyed this Committee, mainly because its members have worked so well together, which does not always happen. I hope that I have managed to keep my face from displaying what I believe and think in some instances—sometimes it is difficult sitting up here in the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may not be aware that one of the perks of being a Chairman is that one is not allowed to take part in any further proceedings of the Committee. The number of times that the Minister has said that he will reconsider matters and speak about them on Report suggests that that stage of consideration will be lengthy and that I shall have a long evening off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
