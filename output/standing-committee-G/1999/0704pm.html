<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I am sorry to interrupt our proceedings, but I want to raise a matter that I have raised previously because nothing has been done about it. It is very difficult for hon. Members, when reading amendments to new clauses, to identify where the amendments would be made because the convention is not to print line numbers in new clauses. Although the amendments refer to line numbers, the lines can be identified only by counting them.<br><br>
I have raised the matter in previous Standing Committees in the hope that, in the exalted counsels of the Chairmen's Panel, it might be possible to agree the not-very-radical modernisation of line numbers being printed in new clauses. For the benefit of this and future Standing Committees, Mr. Gale, perhaps you would raise the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter. The line numbers were printed on the blue amendment paper, but seem to have disappeared today for reasons of which no one is sure. I shall certainly draw the matter to the attention of the next meeting of the Chairmen's Panel with a request that line numbers should be included as a matter of course. That seems to me an entirely reasonable request.</span></p>

GENERAL INTERPRETATION ETC</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 479, in page 63, line 21, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() In this Act, the expression "nursing care" means provision of care that is not "personal care" or "practical assistance" as defined in this Act and includes assessment, treatment or care which can only be provided by or under the supervision by a registered nurse and extends to control of medication, dressing, injections, feeding requiring nursing skills, pressure sores, specialist incontinence management, complex prosthesis management and appliances, cognitive and behavioural support and management of complex psychological or aggressive states; but does not include any prescribed activity or extend to the provision of equipment by health authorities.'.—[<i>Mr. Burstow.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 480, in page 63, line 21, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) In this Act, the expression "practical assistance" means assistance with activities for daily living undertaken by care homes, day centres and domiciliary care agencies that is not "personal care" or "nursing care" as defined in this Act and includes housework, cleaning, laundry, shopping services, specialist transport involving assistance and the provision of advice, encouragement and assistance but does not extend to any prescribed activity.'.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
No. 481, in page 63, line 22, leave out from 'care'" to end of line 24 and insert

No. 494, in page 63, line 22, leave out 'or "nursing or personal care".'.<br><br>
No. 495, in page 63, leave out line 24 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'activity prescribed by regulations as being excluded from "personal care".'.</p></blockquote>
Government amendment No. 474.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch, we were discussing Government amendment No. 474 and the necessary requirements for an establishment to be a care home. I remind the Committee that the proposed requirements are the same as those in the Registered Homes Act 1984, which were clarified by the Harrison <i>v.</i> Cornwall County Council judgment with which the Committee is familiar, and which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) accurately identified as going to the heart of the issue. The purpose of the amendment is replicate the requirement in the 1984 Act as clarified in the Harrison judgment. That is important because we intend that the homes that are currently required to register under the 1984 Act should be required to register under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be saying that it is not possible for the courts to interpret the definition in the 1984 Act in a way that extends it to extra care or supported housing. I tried to raise that matter earlier and it would be helpful if the Minister would clarify it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important issue and the difficulty is that there is no single, clear definition of sheltered or supported accommodation. It is technically impossible to state categorically that such accommodation could never be considered to be a care home. However, in almost all such arrangements, care is provided to people in their own homes and that is the essential difference. It is not our intention that someone's own home should be registered as a care home and we are anxious to assure providers in that sector that that will remain the position. We accept the Harrison <i>v.</i> Cornwall county council interpretation in the context of care homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps this is an appropriate point to ask a question that has been at the back of my mind throughout our proceedings. When someone is cared for long-term in another person's home for payment—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 695</span>
I am thinking of one of my constituents with severe learning disabilities who has been provided with that service for a number of years—would that home be considered a care home within the scope of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to provide an off-the-cuff answer to that question. I shall have to reserve my position in relation to the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman raises. I shall be happy to correspond with him on the matter. If the care were being provided in the frail old person's own home, there would be no argument about it. If someone else's home were being used, essentially for commercial purposes, as a place in which care was provided, I suppose that the answer is, technically, yes, it is possible that that might be so. However, I cannot give a once-and-for-all answer to that question. Those circumstances probably need to be judged on a case-by-case basis. I shall take further advice, and relay my answer to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
In terms of the Government amendments, the definition of a domiciliary care agency is given in clause 4(3), as
<br><blockquote><p>an undertaking which consists of or includes arranging the provision of personal care in their own homes for persons who by reason of illness, infirmity or disability are unable to provide it for themselves without assistance.</p></blockquote>
I hope that it is clear from the words
<br><blockquote><p>unable to provide it for themselves without assistance</p></blockquote>
that personal care in this context has a narrower meaning than in the context of a care home. It will clearly include assistance with bodily functions and physical care, which falls short of assistance such as helping a person to get dressed. However, it could not extend to encouragement and emotional support, as that is not a form of personal care that a person could be said to be unable to provide for themselves. Within the normal meaning of the words, a person cannot be said to be either able or unable to provide themselves with emotional support.<br><br>
In the context of the definition of a domiciliary care agency, the words "personal care" have a narrower meaning than in the context of a care home. I apologise for the somewhat long explanation, but I hope that I have, at least in part, managed to explain why we do not want to define personal care in the Bill, and why we believe that it is more suitable that it should take its meaning from the appropriate care context.<br><br>
In amendments Nos. 479 to 481, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam was trying to clarify what was meant by "personal care" in the Bill. In speaking to the Government's amendment, I have explained why we did not want to go down that road. I hope that, in so doing, I have been able to reassure the hon. Gentleman that our amendment will give him and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) what they sought to achieve in their amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 481 provides a list of activities that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would want to see specifically included in the definition of personal care. As I have explained, all those activities would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
within the meaning of personal care as provided by a care home, in the context of the amendments that I have just moved.<br><br>
Similarly, amendment No. 480 offers a definition of practical assistance and includes a list of activities that form part of practical assistance. The amendment makes it clear that those types of practical assistance should be excluded from the definition of personal care. Again, I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman that most of those activities would not fall within the meaning of personal care, as provided by either a care home or a domiciliary care agency as defined in the Bill. There is no intention to regulate in the Bill agencies that provide only housework, cleaning, shopping and so on. They would not come within the definition of a domiciliary care agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a way, the reason why we tabled the amendment on practical assistance was to test whether the Government might, at some point, be willing to consider the possibility of bringing such activities within the scope of the registration authority. Agencies that provide those services have direct access to vulnerable adults. They may not be providing intimate services, but they still have the ability to abuse. There is, therefore, an argument that they should be covered by the regulatory regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly an argument to that effect. I have tried to set out the Government's intentions in relation to the regulation of domiciliary care agencies, and we do not intend that kind of agency to fall within the definition of a care agency as I have described. Some agencies may be providing that kind of care and providing no personal care at all. I think that they would be outside the scope of the Bill. If an agency were providing some personal care, within the context of the Bill, it would be registered as an agency, which I hope will provide some reconciliation for the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Amendment No. 479 attempts to define nursing care. This is very tricky territory, and I think that the hon. Gentleman alluded to that in his remarks. I am not sure that the Committee would want to agree that injections could be provided only by or under the supervision of a registered nurse, for example. I wonder what a diabetic who administers his own injections would make of that suggestion—probably not much. What about dressings? It is not clear whether the amendment means "dressing" in the sense of getting one's kit on or of wounds. Even supposing that it means dressing wounds, would the Committee want to agree that that could be done only by or under the supervision of a registered nurse? When seeking to define such matters, it is important to get it right.<br><br>
The wider problem with the amendment is that it is based on a list-based definition of relevant issues. That approach always gives rise to problems involving the omission of categories from the list and the exact meanings of terms. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has not sought to define the terms that he wishes to incorporate into the Bill. The hon. Gentleman often tables such amendments, and they bring out the worst in me. I am not trying to be difficult or unkind; I appreciate the support that he is generally able to give to the Government. However,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 697</span>
his attempted solution to the problem would create more difficulties than it would resolve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand <span class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I clearly follow the Minister's argument. Nevertheless, does he intend to clarify in regulations difficult areas such as rectal diazopam—which can be given by some care workers but not by others—dressings, and injections for people with diabetes? There seem to be different rules in different parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not intend to talk about rectal diazopam. I would not try to minimise the importance of the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman identified. My argument concerns whether such issues should be resolved in the Bill in the way that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam suggests. I am sure that the National Care Standards Commission will give them the careful consideration that they deserve.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's concerns stem partly from the wider debate that he and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam want to have—essentially, who pays for what kind of care? [<i>Interruption.</i>] I spotted that that was so earlier; the hon. Gentleman was not here at the time. I know that they want to have that debate—so do we, but not here and now in the context of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not try to open that debate here.<br><br>
Can the Minister confirm that a working group, which has met at least a couple of times, is considering the definition of nursing care? Is it intended that that will lead to some of the regulations that will be introduced after the Bill is enacted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We convened a seminar on 1 March with several interested parties. I believe that it has met only once. Its deliberations concerned some important issues of which hon. Members will want to be apprised, and we intend shortly to publish the results on the Department's website.<br><br>
With respect to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, the issues in the amendment, important as they are, have been raised out of context. Although I cannot pre-judge any of the House's legislative programme, I am sure that there will be an opportunity for him to return to the argument in future.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 494 and 495 would both have the same effect. They would limit the power to make regulations under clause 100(3) to exempt activities, so that it could apply only to personal care, not to nursing. We expect to need the power in relation only to personal care, and I assure members of the Committee that we do not intend at this stage to use it to exempt activities from the meaning of nursing care. I hope that I have dealt with all the points that have arisen during the debate, and that the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Isle of Wight will be reassured by the undertakings that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to think that when I table amendments I sometimes lead with the chin, and he cannot resist responding. On this occasion, I am grateful that he resisted in his response to the amendments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
The debate has been a useful airing of the issues, and the clarification provided by the Minister about the effect of his amendment goes some way towards addressing the concerns behind the amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight and I have tabled. I still have some concerns about what appears to be a re-definition of the purpose of a definition. The Minister has told us that "personal care" has become an umbrella term, and that a series of different definitions of personal care will be applied in different circumstances. I will re-read <i>Hansard</i> and check that that is what was said, although that is certainly, my interpretation of what we have been told today. That approach would be a recipe for further confusion and for potential legal challenge.<br><br>
However, I want to consider some issues further, and, given that the Minister has said that there might be an opportunity to return to the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> No. 473, in page 63, line 22, leave out from 'care'" to 'does' in line 23.</p>

When I looked at the amendment today, it occurred to me that I must have been in a bad mood when I drafted it. Perhaps the Minister had done something that rattled my cage. I would be the first to concede that the amendment's ambition is fairly minor. However, economy is all, and it seems that the "'s" on "child's" in subsection (4) adds nothing to the meaning. Does the Minister agree?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 699</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an argument about correct grammar. I do not claim to be the world's leading expert, and I often, infuriatingly, put the apostrophe in the wrong place. I am assured that the current wording of the clause is correct. I have accepted several of the drafting amendments previously tabled by the hon. Gentleman, but, sadly, I cannot accept this one. On this occasion, he has got it wrong—the current drafting is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for, at least, considering the issue. It may be a matter of taste. I must say, with no disrespect, that the grammatical styles employed by the draftsmen can be a bit of a dog's breakfast—that is "dog's" with an apostrophe "s". However, I am prepared to accept that the Minister has considered the matter carefully and does not agree. We must agree to differ stylistically on this point, as on others.<br><br>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has discussed the definition of the terms "illness", "mental disorder" and "mentally impaired". The Minister said that he was not entirely satisfied that "ill" and "illness" were correctly defined. In that debate, the Minister said that there was no intention to give offence through the terminology of the Bill and that he would consider the interaction of the definitions of the words "illness" and "mental disorder" in the clause. As the Bill stands, a person suffering from a learning disability would be regarded as suffering from an illness. That would strike most of us as very odd. Given that we shall shortly consider amendments and new clauses that will be tabled on Report, does the Minister intend to table others on Report that will deal with the problem? If not, I suspect that we and perhaps other Opposition Members will want to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made two points. He said that the word "ill" in clause 2 and the word "illness" in clause 100 are not aligned, and I said that we might need to table an appropriate tidying-up amendment. However, I am advised that no such amendment is needed, because the meaning of the terms "ill" and "illness" is clear. There is no need to align them more precisely, and I am content with the legal advice that I have received in that regard.<br><br>
We dealt with the wider issues in this morning's debate, when the hon. Gentleman was enjoying being interviewed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson). I hope that he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
has recovered from that exchange. I made it clear then that we did not want our proposed definitions to cause offence or be construed as rude or discourteous. I suggested that, if an amendment were tabled, it would be Report, but we are still considering the matter and have yet to reach a decision.<br><br>
However, as I said to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), there is a slight problem. The definition of disability in this context has a long pedigree, stretching back to section 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948. I appreciate that our use of language has changed a lot since then, but Administrations of both main political parties have chosen to maintain in subsequent legislation the essence of the definition in the 1948 Act, which uses terms that could give rise to concern and offence. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is a strong advocate of consistent definitions, and so are we. We certainly do not want to perpetuate any sense of discourtesy to people with disabilities, and we are considering the issue actively and carefully, but I am afraid that I cannot yet tell the hon. Gentleman on which side of the line our argument has fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for a letter that I received this morning about another Bill that raises similar issues. I am concerned that we appear to be bound by previous practice, and I hope that the Minister will not take too seriously the advice of legislators, who are more interested in a convenient legal framework than a service for those whom we are here to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are bound neither by our parliamentary predecessors nor previous legislation. It is for us to make such judgment calls as we see fit and in light of today's circumstances. I accept the point, which the hon. Gentleman and others have made, that it is the responsibility of hon. Members to ensure that the language used in such definitions is right. We are doing that, and we are very anxious to prevent primary legislation offending anyone with a disability. That is not what we are about, and we are taking the matter seriously, but the only caveat is that the problem is trickier to unpick than some Committee members might suggest. To get it right, we might need to go through all manner of other social care legislation, such as the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989. That might not be the easiest thing in the world to do, but if it is the right thing to do, we will do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I understand that the problem of an accrued body of usage would also have to be addressed. I hope that I shall be allowed to wander a fraction as we draw to the end of our proceedings. Having small children, I often find myself reading books that I remember from my childhood—"Noddy" springs to mind. I have noticed that words, languages and images in children's books have been altered to reflect the changing sense of what is acceptable and offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The grammar has probably changed.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 701</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Under-Secretary that the grammar has not changed. It is good, old-fashioned grammar.<br><br>
Terms that would have seemed normal and natural to our parents are no longer acceptable today because they may give rise to offence.<br><br>
I wanted to avoid the tedious business of the Opposition inexpertly drafting changes only to find on Report that they are grouped with amendments that are more expertly drafted by Government draftsmen. We are only three days away from the last day for tabling amendments to be considered on Report next Wednesday—presuming that is when we reach Report—and I am slightly disappointed that the Minister has not come to a conclusion. Will he write to Committee members within the next couple of days on this and other matters that he has specifically said that he will consider further—I have kept a record of them, which I shall be happy to pass to him—so that we know whether there is a need to table amendments on Report? It benefits no one if we try to crowd out the same area. If the Government are to address our concerns, we will be happy to leave it to the professionals that they have at their disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I said that I would write to him on a number of issues. Indeed, I am writing to him today on one or two matters. I shall be more than willing to discuss the particular concerns that he and the hon. Member for Meriden have about the definition of disability if they want to come to the Department.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the fact that the Committee's proceedings are drawing to a conclusion. I thought that he was preparing to be one of the politically correct brigade by railing against the use of language in Enid Blyton and other texts. Fortunately, we do not have to apply his analytical and grammatical skills to revising such famous texts. I read those books to my children, the youngest of whom is 12 so he probably wonders what I am doing.<br><br>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman. There are one or two outstanding issues, but I shall write to him.</span></p>

FALSE STATEMENTS IN APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) Any person who, in an application for registration under this Part or for the variation of any condition in force in relation to his registration, knowingly makes a statement which is false or misleading in a material respect shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
<p>(2) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale.'.—[<i>Mr. Hutton.</i>]</p>

<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The new clause provides that it would be an offence to supply false or misleading information on application forms to register or to vary a condition of registration with the National Care Standards Commission. It is important that the information supplied in applications to the registration authority is accurate because it forms the basis on which a decision to register is made. The same applies to applications to vary a condition of registration. Making it an offence to supply false or misleading information should act as a strong incentive for people to complete their applications fully, honestly and accurately. Similar provision already applies in other fields. For instance, it operates in the Charities Act 1993 with regard to applicants who want to register as a charity.</span></p>

I much prefer to move new clauses formally, so perhaps I should have continued to so. The new clause will allow an adoption agency to carry out checks against the list drawn up under the Protection of Children Act 1999 when assessing the suitability of prospective adoptive parents. It will extend the scope of inquiry for adoption agencies in carrying out the task of making necessary checks about the suitability of prospective adopters. It will provide greater protection for children who are to be adopted and will increase the sources of information that are available to adoption agencies in carrying out the checks. It puts adoption on a par with foster care, insofar as local authorities have access to the 1999 Act.</span></p>

CHARGES FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY WELFARE SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>"Health and Social Services and Social Security Charges for local authority welfare services Adjudications Act 1983 (c. 41).
<br><blockquote><p>Section 17, so far as relating to services provided under the enactments mentioned in subsection (2)(a) to (c)".'.[<i>Mr. Hutton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may also take Government amendment No. 478, in title, line 15, after '1957', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'to amend Schedule 1 to the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments because they will give the Secretary of State the power to issue statutory guidance to local authorities about their charges for non-residential social services. Amendment No. 478 is a necessary consequential amendment. The need for that guidance has been demonstrated very well in the recent Audit Commission report entitled "Charging with Care", which was published a couple of months ago. Back in 1998, the Government made it clear that we would wait until the Audit Commission report was published before deciding on the appropriate course of action to take to end what we described then as the unacceptable scale of variation in charging for non-residential services.<br><br>
The Audit Commission report confirmed what many of us have known for some time, especially from the work that we undertake in our own constituencies. There was a need for new and more effective arrangements to end some of the anomalies and injustices that the current scale of variation in charging for non-residential social care services has created. We want to spell out the detail of our proposals later this summer when we will say what form the guidance will take, and we shall consult fully on that draft guidance. We have already had at least one meeting at the Department of Health, at which we began the process of consultation with leading representative organisations who have an interest in these important matters. The question of how councils should treat benefits is an important issue, and we shall want to consider carefully along with other interested parties how to deal with such issues.<br><br>
As the Audit Commission's report shows, the important point is that the treatment of benefits and income should be reasonable, whether it is paid
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 713</span>
because a person needs extra help as a result of a disability or for living expenses. That is the basic requirement of the 1983 legislation—the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983. We want to consult with interested parties to ensure that users are treated fairly and equitably. We shall also consider other important issues as part of the guidance exercise, but the clause and our amendments present the appropriate context in which to have that debate and, hopefully, to resolve the complex and persistent problems to which hon. Members have been drawing attention for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long because I entirely welcome the Government amendments. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us whether the power that the new clause and the amendment will give the Government will be sufficient to permit them to issue guidance that could lead to the ending of charging in local authorities. I am not proposing that, but it would be interesting to know whether the scope of the new clause is wide enough to give the Secretary of State that power.<br><br>
The Minister rightly drew our attention to the Audit Commission. When the social services White Paper was published in 1998, the commitment to produce a new policy on fair access to services and so on was predicated on the outcome of an Audit Commission report. The commission is completely independent of Government, and I know from questions that I have put to it that its timetable did not greatly delay publication of the report. It therefore puzzles me that the Government should allow almost two years to pass before recognising that additional powers were needed to issue statutory guidance to local authorities, especially as the wide variation that then existed in charging policy was recognised in the White Paper.<br><br>
If the Audit Commission's analysis is to be believed, the variation seems to have widened still further. That is cause for concern. Many hon. Members will have received deputations from the coalition on charging and will know of the anxiety that charging policies are driving people into poverty. Even the Minister alluded to the costs of disability and the fact that they are dealt with very differently by local authorities.<br><br>
The Audit Commission made two recommendations. Will they will be embraced in what comes next? First, the commission said that clear guidance was needed on how local authorities should assess people's income and expenditure and the costs that fall on them both generally and in relation to their disabilities. Secondly, it said that the Government should consider the framework tellingly set out in its report, which was based on the model suggested by the royal commission. It clearly delineated the costs of personal care, nursing care and supported housing, and living and accommodation costs. Will that model be embraced by the Government? I hope that it will, because it provides a good basis for thinking about these issues.<br><br>
The current guidance of the social services inspectorate, which dates back to 1994, says that the only benefit income that is to be disregarded or not included in the assessments is the mobility component
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
of the disability living allowance, and that all other benefit income, means tested or otherwise, can be included. As we know, one council in three includes it, but that leaves people with less income than income support, which is not a sustainable or acceptable result for our charging policies. At the very least, that guidance should be withdrawn. That would send local authorities the clear signal that it is no longer an acceptable basis for local authorities' charging policies. Do the Government intend to issue temporary or provisional guidance before using the powers that the new clause would give them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are clearly trying to address a problem that was highlighted by the Audit Commission and which, as the Minister said, many of us have been aware of for a long time. It underlines the dilemma faced by the Government in much of its social care and health policy. On one hand, they want equity, which implies national standards, standardised changing arrangements and equality of access; and on the other hand, they purport to support the idea of the devolution of decision and power to the tier of government closest to the community. The Secretary of State s predecessor talked of local communities making choices about their health care priorities. That is a legitimate aspiration, but it does not always sit comfortably with national standards and frameworks within which health care or social care is delivered.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
My concern is that, although it might benefit recipients if we constrained the freedom of local government to set its own charges and policies, we would be putting one more nail in the coffin of local government. I am sure the Minister is sensitive to that. If he is not, many of his colleagues in the parliamentary Labour party will be able to advise him. Their discussions with councillors across the political divide—this is not a party-political issue—will have revealed the feeling, especially in second tier and unitary authorities, that they are increasingly being bypassed by the Government. They are being turned into little more than agents who are given money but told precisely how and where they must spend it, on what and in co-operation with whom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was resisting intervening, but when exactly did councillors reach that view? When did they start to express it? Was it before or after the Government's election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a clever point. Let me hold my hands up and admit that it has been going on for a long time. Just as in the national health service doctors and managers are saying to us, "We really thought in the spring of 1997 it couldn't get any worse, but it has. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Yes they do. If hon. Members want source references, I can give them. Many local councillors—members of both the Labour and Conservative parties—have told me that they thought the previous Government constrained the freedom of local government as much as possible but that now they are even more constrained and looking at a bleaker future. If the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam does not recognise that model, I suggest he talks to a wider range of members of local authorities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 715</span>
My point—I assume that the Minister will accept the incontrovertible logic of this—is that standardising charging or constraining the flexibility to charge will mean that some recipients of services will be happy because their charges will decrease. However, in other cases, the recipients of services will be unhappy because local authorities that charge nominal sums or which do not charge at all for some services might have to charge. Do the Government intend the standardising of charges or the creation of bands of charges to be revenue-neutral? Overall, will decreases in charging be offset by increases in charging? What measures do the Government envisage will deal with the inevitable effects of relatively high charging local authorities decreasing their charges and creating a hole in their budgets? The obvious way to plug the hole—the only solution in the short term—would be to decrease the supply of services. It would be a Pyrrhic victory if, by trying to reduce charges for a service in an area, the Minister's actual achievement was the non-availability of those services to many people because local authorities experienced budgetary constraints. To understand the logic that lies behind the Government's approach, we have to understand the joined-up implications for local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an eloquent case for the greater independence of local government and for the need for joined-up thinking on charging policies. If he is advocating more freedom for local government, which I support, where does he stand on the Audit Commission report's finding that one in three councils is levying charges at such a level that people are driven below income support levels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We understand the motivation that lies behind the new clause. However, we need to be transparent and up front about the consequences of the approach for local government and for services in areas in which charging has traditionally been high.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right—a good case could be made, in various parts of the country, for bringing charges down because of their impact on the individuals who need the services. However, he, too, would have scored a Pyrrhic victory if bringing charges down simply meant that the supply of services was dramatically reduced. I know that that is not his, or the Government's, objective. I am not making a narrow party political point—I draw attention to the fact that the superficially attractive objective of standardising charges is fraught with dangers, which could affect the independence and future of local government. It might also affect the supply of services and raise costs to individuals—in that regard, charging may go up. Unless the Government start the band width at zero, charges will increase in some cases. Local authorities have set their budgets and arranged their finances on the basis of a charging policy, and individuals will have organised their finances on the basis of the charging policy with which they currently deal. The matter has implications for them and for local government. What thought has been given to that matter?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of us on the Government Benches sometimes have to pinch ourselves when we listen to the speeches of Opposition spokespersons on these matters. I am not entirely sure whether the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is a passionate supporter of devolved local government—he may clarify the position—but if he is, how is that consistent with the Conservatives' announced plan to abolish local education authorities? There may be an explanation—he need not provide it today, but perhaps we shall hear about it at some point.<br><br>
It is astonishing that the hon. Gentleman should say, "Yes, we agree with the Government that there is a problem," but decry the method that we have adopted to solve it. This is an important provision, but we do not want to make too much of it—we are, essentially, preserving the discretion of local authorities to set charges, and we shall not remove that discretion. That arrangement has applied since social services departments were set up in their present form in 1970. They are required to exercise their social services functions under the direction and guidance of the Secretary of State. We shall not change that arrangement; it is the characteristic of social services functions and of their relationship with central and local government.<br><br>
Our approach involves stating explicitly in legislation that the Secretary of State can issue guidance to local authorities, which will preserve the relevant discretion. That might answer some of the concerns of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who asked whether we could use the power to issue guidance in order to, as he put it, abolish charging. The guidance could specify circumstances in which we considered it inappropriate for local authorities to levy a charge. However, it would not be possible under the Bill to issue guidance for the purpose of abolishing a power given to local authorities in primary legislation. That is unlikely to be a solution.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me—as did the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam—to go into greater detail about what the guidance will cover. He rightly drew attention to a number of authorities that do not assess means when assessing a person's liability in order to make a charge. I am not persuaded that that would be a reasonable charging regime under section 17 of the 1983 Act. Many local authorities set their charges in that way, and that is a problem. However, we are all capable of identifying the problem areas.<br><br>
There are probably half a dozen main areas of concern, and I want the guidance to cover those areas. I do not want to go any further today in saying precisely what is to be in the guidance. There is to be a consultation process, and the right thing to do is to talk to people about the issues. That is how we intend to go about the task. I am tempted to say a great deal more on the subject, but I shall not do so on this occasion. There will come a time when we can explore the issues in more detail. Meanwhile, we shall conduct an active consultation process over the next few months with all the local interested organisations.<br><br>
I understand that the Local Government Association welcomes the opportunity for the

Secretary of State to issue new guidance. I am not sure whether it was right for the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to express himself as he did, when he said that local authorities would regard the measure as yet another smash-and-grab raid, carried out at dead of night, to dismantle yet another pillar of the local government firmament. That will clearly not be the case.<br><br>
The new clause is important, and we hope that it will address a long-standing problem. It would be helpful if hon. Members considered it in that context. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge talked about money, and about whether we would compensate local authorities. Again, he invited me to go into detail about what the guidance might cover. I shall not do so today, not because I do not want to share that information with the Committee but because it is too early for me to specify it in any great detail.<br><br>
However, I would like members of the Committee to bear in mind one important statistic. Charge income represents about 8 per cent. of the costs of non-residential social services. Local authorities are spending about £2.7 billion on such services and recovering about £210 million through charging. That is the context of the provision. Yes, £200 million is £200 million, and charges are often levied against people on low incomes, but that is another issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister will have the following information to hand—he seems to have a great many figures in his mind. He said that an average of 8 per cent. was recovered, but presumably some authorities recover much more than that, while others recover very much less. Does he know what the range is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 8 per cent. is an average figure; some authorities charge nothing at all. My own local authority in Cumbria is one of eight or nine in England that does not levy a charge. There is no charge income raised in my county. In others, the figure rises significantly higher than 8 per cent.—sometimes as high as 20 or 30 per cent. I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with the information that he requires, if he will allow me to do so by writing to him.<br><br>
This is an important provision, without which we could not address issues that have been of longstanding concern to Members of Parliament.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 458.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause not only looks long but is long. However, its purpose and effect are simple. Subsection (1) enables a local authority to refer to the Protection of Children Act 1999 list a relevant individual whom
<br><blockquote><p>the authority considers … guilty of misconduct … which harmed a child or placed a child at risk of harm.</p></blockquote>
A relevant individual is someone who is or has been employed to provide care to a child and whose employment is funded by a direct payment under section 17A of the Children Act 1989.<br><br>
Subsections (2) and (3) enable a person who employs an individual to care for his child—when that care is funded by a direct payment—to ask the local authority to check the Protection of Children Act and Department for Education and Employment lists. The checks will be made as the one-stop shop comes on stream. Subsection (4) is purely consequential. Amendment No. 458 provides for the insertion of an appropriate definition of local authority into the Protection of Children Act.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My question refers to our debate on 8 June about the way in which direct payments would be affected by the Bill. At that time, I sought reassurances about whether people receiving direct payments would find that their discretion over how they provide care packages was, to some extent, fettered. The amendment and the new clause provide a useful mechanism to give such people the security that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to in that debate, should they want it, without rendering them subject to all the other controls and regulations set out in the Bill.<br><br>
Why do the new clause and the amendment deal only with direct payments as they relate to services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0402">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 719</span>
purchased on behalf of children? Why is it not possible to have a similar mechanism for other people in receipt of direct payments? There should be similar access to lists for those making decisions about employment. Someone who is offered employment as a personal assistant may not be a social care worker; that is fine. However, if he or she is a social care worker, whose name is on the list, it would be useful for anyone making a decision about appointing such a person to know that. Could a mechanism be created that would make that service available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the query. The amendment refers to the Protection of Children Act 1999 because we are dealing with situations in which children are receiving services through the direct payment route. Obviously, the appropriate list to refer to is the Protection of Children Act list. That is the context in which we must consider the extra protection measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not articulating my point clearly enough. I am asking the Minister whether there should be a similar mechanism for vulnerable adults. That would give those adults and those who care for them similar access to checks. Have the Government, at least, considered the possibility of putting something of that sort into the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is, in part, explicable by reference to the different nature of the services that would be provided for an adult. In respect of disabled adults, it could be said that an adult makes a conscious decision to take on extra responsibilities by opting for direct payment. That gives them more choice and control in deciding how their support needs are met. If they want to exercise that freedom, in deciding who should meet their support needs, they can employ personal assistants. If, however, direct payment recipients want independent reassurance about the suitability of a personal assistant, they can enter into a contract with an agency registered under the Bill. My officials will discuss the issue with key voluntary organisations and canvass their views on whether they would welcome the introduction of checks of the Protection of Children Act list.<br><br>
The user guide to direct payments contains advice relating to the employment of a personal assistant. Paragraphs 32 and 60 of the policy and practice guidance alert people to the provision in the Bill and advise them that anyone who wants the reassurance of regulations should make a contract with an agency. In essence, the argument is, as ever, about where we should draw the line. The hon. Gentleman will know that children represent a particularly vulnerable group of people. It makes sense to have a mechanism to allow checks against the POCA list, but the arguments relating to decisions made by a competent adult about the employment of a personal care assistant are slightly different. We may need to return to the issue.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that we should not fetter the discretion of people who receive direct payments. We have always striven to grapple with that issue. We are not complacent, or unaware of the issues, but cases
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
in which adults are making decisions about employing people to look after them are slightly different.</span></p>

INDEPENDENT ADVOCACY SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'. Local authorities shall secure that independent advocacy services are available for all children in their area who are placed under the provisions of Part II of this Act.'.—[<i>Mr. Burstow.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) and for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) for adding their names to this new clause. It addresses a matter that is of concern to hon. Members from all parties, as was the case in our earlier debate about the commissioner for children's rights. This will be a brief extension of that debate.<br><br>
The clause is about how we put in place long called-for measures. There is a list of reports—the Wagner report, the Warner report, the Utting report, the Government's own quality protects programme, the Waterhouse report—all of which call, in one form or another, for independent advocacy to be available to children, so that children in care can make sure of their rights. The new clause would place an obligation on local authorities to provide independent advocacy for children.<br><br>
The matter has been debated in the House of Lords, and the Government have, so far, set their face against amending the Bill, although they have outlined in some detail the steps that have been taken. I do not want to take credit away from the Government for the steps that they have taken in quality protects, an ambitious and welcome programme. I know from the debate in the House of Lords that work is being done around the year 2 quality protects programme.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I am still of the view that we would be sending out a powerful signal if we were to insert a requirement to provide advocacy services. Although those services are developing and more local authorities provide them, there is still too much variation. The new clause would end that variation and provide a guarantee that advocacy would be available to children when and where they need it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hilton Dawson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster and Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is good to speak in such an important debate. I am pleased that, since the new clause was tabled, we have seen the publication of "Learning the Lessons", the Government's response to Waterhouse. I was delighted, in particular, by the response to recommendation 4D of "Lost in Care", which states that the Government should
<br><blockquote><p>ensure that recourse to an independent advocacy service is available to any complainant or affected child who wishes to have it.</p></blockquote>
The Government have responded positively to that and are involved in consultations about whether a child who is pursuing a complaint should have a legal right to an advocate. That is a great step forward. It has been difficult for young people to gain access to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0403">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 721</span>
complaints procedures, even in cases in which the best possible procedures have been in place. Vulnerable young people living under pressure, without tangible support, and in circumstances where complaints are regarded as a nuisance at best—and sometimes far worse—have found it difficult to pursue a legitimate and often serious complaint.<br><br>
This is a significant step forward. However, if the consultation concludes that, in such circumstances, there should be a legal right to advocacy, how will that be incorporated in forthcoming legislation? Of course, I retain some concerns. It is not just at the complaints stage that advocacy is needed for young people in care. Often, some of the crucial issues in young people's lives—their legal status, where they will live, where they will go to school, whether they will remain in care—are decided by reviews. The best reviews take on board entirely the concern—expressed in the Children Act 1989—that the wishes and feelings of young people should form part of the process, and their best interests should be paramount. Clearly, the experiences of many young people show that they do not have the ready access to advocacy to which they should be entitled.<br><br>
Similarly, in the planning of services for looked-after children, some of the most well-informed people are the children themselves. It is a sign of this Government's tremendous commitment to reforming the care system that young people in care have been taken into the Department of Health and included in working parties. Their views have been listened to and entirely validated, and real progress has again been made, although there is always room for more.<br><br>
The official Opposition sometimes try to paint a picture—I understand why—of a seamless transition from the Children Act to today. The 1989 Act began with the greatest of intentions, and it is a fine statement of principle, but it contains glaring loopholes, partly because of underfunding. As we have seen throughout this debate, when in government the Opposition were not prepared to go the distance and include statutory duties or enforce the necessary standards. That is what this Government are doing, and I am pleased that they are responding positively to the new clause that was tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the remarks made by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and the intention behind the new clause. Advocacy is important, and I have two brief points to make in that regard.<br><br>
Were we to implement the provisions in the Children Act that the hon. Gentleman kindly supported, in most cases where a family member or regular visitor was not available, advocacy would be provided by the kind of independent lay visitor to whom an earlier clause makes reference. In most cases, a non-professional outsider who is close to, and has visited, the child in question ought to be available, but as has been noted, that is sadly not often the case. Many children in care are not visited, and most local authorities do not bother to ensure that there are independent lay visitors for such children. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 722</span>
intention behind the provision is therefore entirely right.<br><br>
I want to draw a parallel, which may seem curious because it concerns a disciplinary matter and we are not discussing discipline. We are discussing complaints, but they often involve serious breaches of the law. Our military code of discipline is often attacked for being insufficiently generous, but it is an absolute requirement that before any disciplinary offence against a member of the armed forces—including commissioned officers, who are highly articulate—can be considered, someone acceptable to him must be appointed to act as "the prisoner's friend". People as articulate and able to protect themselves as commissioned officers of the armed forces must have an advocate before legal proceedings can even be considered against them, but it is a mockery that a child, perhaps a very young child, who may have suffered terrible abuse and whose worries may involve the most serious breaches of the law, cannot have an adult from outside the system to speak for them.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
I want the Government to accept the amendment, but it would rarely be necessary to use it if we could make the provisions in the Children Act work and ensure that most children have independent visitors to look after their interests. That would naturally fill the slot without a further requirement for the state to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Joan Humble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I am pleased that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam tabled the amendment so that we can discuss this important issue.<br><br>
I must declare an interest as the president of Blackpool Advocacy, which is an admirable organisation. On Friday, I had a meeting with several volunteers who help with the advocacy service. Interestingly, they are currently using money under the quality protects programme to develop a children's advocacy service and already they are seeing the value of that. They have one full-time co-ordinator, two trained volunteers and two volunteers who are undergoing training. Since April, they have helped 16 children although they are only slowly building up knowledge among young people that the service exists.<br><br>
The co-ordinator made a point similar to that made by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) about links with the independent visitor scheme. The advocacy service is developing those links because it has discovered that young people in care do not necessarily want an advocate to stand up and argue their case; often they just want someone to talk to. We must consider how the service can be linked with other initiatives in local authorities.<br><br>
The scope of the Blackpool initiative is wider than the amendment, which refers to children
<br><blockquote><p>who are placed under the provisions of Part II of this Act.</p></blockquote>
The Blackpool scheme covers not children who are looked after in children's homes or foster care but any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0404">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 723</span>
child in a family that is receiving support from social services Importantly, that includes children with disabilities. Some of the people involved have highlighted the importance of children in such circumstances having access to an advocate who can argue their case. All too often, it is parents who argue about the needs of their children and as children, especially those with disabilities, reach adolescence, what the parents argue for is not always quite what the children themselves want. That is why I say to the Minister that when we consider the schemes that currently operate throughout the country—I refer especially to those that were established under the quality protects programme—we should think about developing an advocacy that will include all the children who should be included and not just those who live in children's homes. Such an advocacy should also include children who are in their own homes, although that leads to a second question about how children can be informed of the service. The Blackpool advocacy scheme advises children in writing as their reviews occur, annually or more frequently, but there can be difficulties in ensuring that all children are aware of the service. We must consider how we can spread information among children.<br><br>
We should also consider the issues that children are raising, which will help to inform us in providing the service that they want. The young people who have been talking to the Blackpool advocacy service have spoken about the appropriateness of their placements, care plans and assessment. Above all, they want help in understanding procedures and in knowing what they can say when other people are discussing their future. They want to be more actively involved in decisions about their own lives. Advocacy is about children finding a voice and then using it, and I would applaud any action that the Government take to help them in doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting, although short, debate. My understanding of the issue has changed somewhat since I first read new clause 1, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>Local authorities shall secure that independent advocacy services are available.</p></blockquote>
That is almost a contradiction in terms, as local authorities will often be the parties against which independent advocacy will be required. The description given by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) of circumstances in Blackpool and the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury painted a picture of lay people and voluntary organisations delivering support. Call me old fashioned, but I am afraid that for me the word "advocacy" speaks only of lawyers and litigation. Both the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend have pointed out that the schemes are not about advocacy in the litigious sense, but about support and assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Humble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Through the Government's quality protects programme, Blackpool social services allocates money to an independent organisation. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
so doing, it recognises that the one paid individual and the volunteers may say "You've not got it right." The organisation is independent and it is welcomed by young people. The hon. Gentleman made an important point about the term "advocate". When the service was launched, I spoke to representatives of the local media who made exactly the same assumption as he did, thinking straight away of lawyers. Perhaps we should reconsider the terminology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes the point perfectly. Some people will find that the hairs on the backs of their necks prickle at the thought of local authorities procuring advocacy, although they will have no problem with the idea that local authorities should be involved in ensuring that young people have adults to support, advise and help them in a much less adversarial way than the word "advocate" implies. If nothing else, the debate has served an important purpose by making it clear that, although the terminology might be hard, the ideas behind it are more complex and less clear cut. No one in the Room would disagree that young people in care have to face difficult decisions on which other young people expect help and support from the natural parents with whom they live. No one would argue with the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury for ensuring, wherever possible, that independent visitors are in place so that children in care have access to a responsible adult with whom they can build a relationship and from whom they can receive support. However, we live in an increasingly litigious society. I am afraid that other people will have a different view of the proposal and think in terms of advocacy in an adversarial situation. Although we all support the former model, I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that many people are worried about encouraging a yet more litigious approach in our society.<br><br>
The obvious point—I do not want to be tedious—concerns this morning's new clauses that were tabled by the Under-Secretary of State for Wales. According to his letter to Committee members, the children's commissioner for Wales will be able to provide support and assistance
<br><blockquote><p>which includes, by virtue of subsection (2),</p></blockquote>
of new clause 37
<br><blockquote><p>financial assistance and arranging for representation in making a complaint or representation to a provider or in any prescribed proceedings.</p></blockquote>
Three different levels or models are on offer. Assuming that the Minister resists new clause 1—which he will because his speaking note tells him to—the Bill neither requires a local authority to secure such services nor enables anyone to provide them. However, the children's commissioner for Wales will be empowered to provide financial support for such services and to arrange representation. The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would go even further by requiring local authorities to provide such services. How will the situation evolve in England and Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has had a chance to peek at my speaking note. It might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
truncate the debate quite substantially if in future I sent them to him.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said something with which we could all agree. We are of one mind that children, especially those who are looked after by local authorities, should have access to effective advocacy services in the way described by my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might have read a little more into the term "advocacy" than is merited by the new clause and the growing practice in local authorities with regard to the provision of advocacy services for looked after children. Advocacy is not a device to supplant proper and appropriate access to legal advice for care proceedings or to any other aspect of the law as it relates to local authorities and looked-after children. It is a mechanism that allows someone to speak up for a child's concerns and to ensure that his or her point of view is effectively communicated to people who are responsible for making decisions about care.<br><br>
Local authorities have spent £12 million as part of the quality protects programme to develop services in the sector. We are keen to encourage the development of those services. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to their consistency. That is why the Department of Health is funding the development of national standards for the agencies that provide advocacy services. We hope to publish the finalised standards later in the summer. That should represent an important step forward in standardising high quality provision throughout the country.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
It is a rather sobering thought that we are six weeks into the Committee's proceedings and debating new clause 1. I had the horrible feeling that we had made no progress. It is an important clause and I accept the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, I shall recommend the Committee not to accept it. The hon. Gentleman will know some of the reasons for the Government taking that view.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the debate in another place. We set out there quite a long list—I shall not give it today—of the measures being taken to improve access to advocacy services. He will be aware that we published a consultation paper last week on reviewing and reforming the social services complaints procedures. We asked specifically for people's views on whether a child making a complaint would be better served by having access to an advocate, and formulating and pursuing a complaint. If we were to accept the new clause, it would truncate and pre-empt that consultation process. I say that not as a clever debating point to get around accepting the new clause, but because it would not be the right time to do so.<br><br>
We have made it clear that children covered by the Children (Leaving Care) Bill will have access to proper advocacy services. We can do that in a variety of ways. We shall ensure that advocacy is available to those children who have an obvious and pressing need for it. We feel strongly that the development and use of high quality advocacy services for children should be encouraged. We believe that advocacy has an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
important role in protecting vulnerable children from harm and abuse. We were reminded of what happens if it is not effective when we debated some of the implications of the Waterhouse report.<br><br>
We take a threefold approach to advocacy services. First, we need to develop consistent national standards in order to ensure high quality care. Secondly, we need to develop and grow the capacity of the agencies that provide the service, so that a proper range of provisions is available. Thirdly, armed with the information that will come from the consultation exercise and the review of social services complaints procedures, we shall be better placed to decide how to proceed with that sort of work and whether to create a new statutory right to advocacy services. I do not rule it out—that would be inappropriate—but we are not persuaded to accept the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument about not pre-judging the outcome of consultation is important. I wonder therefore whether he would have entertained an amendment that secured the necessary regulation-making or guidance-making powers so that, in the light of consultation and with the benefit of national standards, he could secure those national services at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall look at that, but I am not sure that we need to take new powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'> Are we not inviting the Minister to take on new duties rather than new powers? We welcome the initiatives that he has described to support the development of advocacy, but helping them to start is not enough. They will need continued support, and that will require the placing of a statutory duty on local government—or central Government; I do not mind which tier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get into a Hofeldian analysis about the difference between powers and duties; we could be here for a considerable time. However, it is possible that section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 already provides a framework within which the Secretary of State can issue guidance to local authorities in that area. I am not persuaded that a new raft of statutory provision would be necessary if we wanted to follow that course, although I cannot rule out the possibility that we might want to follow that course in future.<br><br>
One of the joys of my job as Minister has been to work with looked after children, who have helped us to formulate much of our quality protects policy, as well as the Bill. It has been a privilege to work with people who have a clear view, which they have been able to express effectively, and who have succeeded in changing policy. Another Bill that will go into Committee later this week represents an additional milestone for looked after children. Such people have been some of the principal movers and shakers in getting us to take these important steps forward. However, whereas I accept the sentiments behind the hon. Gentleman's new clause, I cannot advise the Committee to impose the proposed new duties on local authorities. At the same time, I reserve my position on how to develop advocacy services for children to make them more effective.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
New clause 20 arises from the Government debate on 2 December on long-term care and the royal commission. In that debate, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir J. Stanley) made a passionate and compelling speech about how preserved rights worked in practice. Before 1993, individuals made their own contracts with residential and nursing homes and could claim income support if they needed it to pay their fees. The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 changed responsibilities around. From the implementation of that Act, individuals no longer purchased their care directly from a care home because that became the responsibility of the local authority. It was decided that those who were already in homes when that Act was implemented on 31 March 1993 would have their rights preserved. That included people who were not eligible at the time for state help because they owned substantial capital.<br><br>
About 300,000 people were affected in 1993. There are now 84,000 of those people left, of whom 48,000 are over the age of 65. Not surprisingly, the number of people aged over 65 is decreasing rapidly and will soon be less than half the total of those with preserved rights. The problem is that, in many cases, there is a gap between the income support that is provided and the fees that homes are charging. In fact, some 20,000 people aged over 65 are receiving insufficient income support to pay the fees for the home in which they reside. The effects of such shortfalls are many.<br><br>
Money that is earmarked for personal expenses is being used to top up fees. By contrast, people whose places are funded by a local authority are guaranteed to receive £14 or £15 for personal items. Those who receive insufficient income support use up all their capital. Their capital is reduced not just to the capital limit that currently applies, but right down to zero, and they have to call on friends, family and others for help to top up their fees. In some cases, the good will of home owners means that they accept a lower fee, although, in exchange, the resident will perhaps be required to share a room. The Committee has discussed the new standards for residential care homes in general. Such good will may no longer be possible because of those standards, which could be a further blow to the people involved. At worst, some of them are threatened with eviction.<br><br>
About a month ago, when the Committee started its deliberations, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation produced a more up-to-date and detailed report on the way in which the preserved rights scheme is now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
working. Although it found that half of all residents with preserved rights were charged fees that were fully covered by benefits or which could be otherwise met, the gap was still more than £14 a week for one in four of them, which is more than personal expenses allow for. According to the report, one in 12 were receiving top-ups of more than £65 a week. It also found that although one in three local authority places were in single rooms with en-suite bathrooms, only one in 100 of people with reserved rights had the same quality of accommodation.<br><br>
By setting out some of the findings of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and of Age Concern, which has been campaigning about the matter for a number of years, I have sought to express a serious concern. Ministers said during the debate on 2 December that they would consider that concern and, in addition, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir J. Stanley), who spoke about the matter at that time, has since had meetings with Ministers. However, some questions should be answered now. Where have the Government got to in their consideration of the matter? When will an equitable solution be found to ensure that the threat of eviction will be removed from those over whom it is currently hanging?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the new clause. As I understand it, it would abolish preserved rights and would simply allow local authorities to make direct provision. In other words, it would not transfer responsibility from the Department of Social Services to local authorities under the 1990 Act. It provides a possible solution to the problem about which the hon. Gentleman spoke, but it is not the tidiest solution, although I am sure that that is not its aim and that it seeks mainly to initiate discussion about the action that is being taken.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the Government are concerned about the number of people who are in the position with which the new clause deals. In April 1993, when the arrangements took effect, nearly 250,000 people enjoyed entitlement to the higher rate of income support under the preserved rights scheme. Now, there are only about 75,000 people with preserved rights, some 47,000 of whom are over 60, while 30,000 of them are under that age. The situation has moved on significantly in the seven years since the scheme was established. It would not serve any useful purpose to discuss exactly why the previous Government set up the preserved rights scheme. The reasons are well documented and are clearly explained in a number of different sources by different organisations.<br><br>
A significant issue is now at stake, which is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in his speech on long-term care on the Floor of the House that we would consult on our proposal to transfer responsibility for the preserved rights caseload from the Department of Social Security to local authorities. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that consultation, which finished on 31 May, by which time we had received more than 200 responses to the consultation document. We are currently considering in some detail those responses and the issues that they raise. Although many people expressed concern about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0407">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
the current arrangements, and, in particular, the shortfall between the high rates of income support and fees charged by care home owners, the prospect of changes to the scheme concerns and frightens people. It especially worries the friends and relatives of people with learning disabilities. I acknowledge the security that some people feel because of the guarantee of the benefits that preserved rights confer. That will be one of our main concerns as we study the responses to the consultation. When we announce our policy, I will reassure them that the new arrangements will not disadvantage people who previously had preserved rights.<br><br>
Other issues were raised in the consultation process, especially in relation to access to direct payments and whether we should consider that issue. Ultimately, the hon. Gentleman is trying get me to announce today part of our possible response to the recommendations of the royal commission. I shall not do that and I am sure that he will understand why. The response will be made later in the month. However, I can reassure him that we will consider what can be done between the announcement and the introduction of any new system. If the present arrangements are to be changed, and if local authorities are to be responsible for bringing preserved rights cases directly under the ambit of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, appropriate primary legislation will be needed. However, we would not want people to hang around waiting for those changes to take effect. If we go down that path, we will also look at possible interim changes to the system.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with the points that were made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, but I shall not suggest to my hon. Friends that the new clause be accepted. However, I can assure Committee members that the Government are looking actively at this particularly vulnerable group of people who are caught in a preserved rights scheme. As part of our response, we shall actively consider the best solution to their needs. The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to many problems that they have experienced and the interim changes that could be made, if necessary, as part of the response to the royal commission.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. He is right to conclude that this is a probing amendment, and his comments have proved useful. For a moment, I thought that he was about to reveal part of the Government's response to the royal commission. That would have made this afternoon's sitting even more interesting and informative, but I fear that we must wait a little longer for that. Nevertheless, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 205, in title, line 7, after 'services;', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'to make provision for appeals from local authorities;'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to move new clause 24, with which we are considering a consequential amendment to the long title. At this late stage in the Committee's proceedings, the new clause seeks to remedy a serious injustice in the social services system as it applies to children. Outside local authorities, there is no appeal procedure of any kind for decisions that affect children. There is no procedure for parents who would like to adopt, children who might like a different decision on adoption, or fostering and other child-related areas. That is why subsection (1) of the proposed new clause states:
<br><blockquote><p>Any person affected by a decision of a local authority in the exercise of its relevant functions under this Part shall have the right to appeal.</p></blockquote>
Subsection (2) sets out two grounds for appeal: "miscarriage of justice" and
<br><blockquote><p>failure to comply with legislation and guidelines.</p></blockquote>
Instead of considering those grounds in detail, I shall focus on two cases that illustrate why we need an appeal procedure that can be used against social services.<br><br>
The first case involves a brave lady who has written to the Secretary of State privately and has given me permission to make her case public. I have consulted the Clerks of the House and her lawyers, and it would appear that she could be sued by the local authority concerned, so I hope that it is in order, Mr. Gale, for me to give her some legal protection by placing on the record that this case was originally drawn to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) in his constituency surgery. I discuss it with his full support, as well as hers.<br><br>
I should also preface this sorry case by pointing out that I am not seeking to blacken all social workers—far from it. Nor do I want to make a political point about the fact that the authority concerned is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
Labour-controlled authority. Next door to Islington are two Labour authorities—Camden and Greenwich—which both do rather well on adoption. Indeed, in terms of successful adoptions, a Labour authority has the second highest score in the country.<br><br>
To make the case for the new clause, I need not persuade Committee members that a clearly one-sided presentation of the facts necessarily means that an injustice has occurred. I simply have to persuade them that, in both this case and the second case—which I shall consider more briefly—a reasonable person would conclude that there should be an appeal. The lady in question—her name is Nathalie Vartanpour—is involved in the case of a three-year-old child, whom I will call child S to protect its identity. We are frequently told in discussions of adoption matters that we must understand that there are hardly any babies in care available for adoption: they are all children, in many cases older children. Child S was taken in for adoption as a four-month-old baby, so has now been in the care system for nearly three years.<br><br>
It is relevant to the case to say that the child is of mixed race, being half Turkish Cypriot. Miss Vartanpour and her lawyers believed from the beginning that the council was determined that the child should be placed with adoptive parents of mixed race and of Islamic background. It so happens that Miss Vartanpour is herself of mixed race—she is half Armenian. In fact, she told me that she is remarkably like the child in appearance. Armenia, although it is a Christian country, is a neighbour of Turkey's, and there is considerable ethnic similarity between them.<br><br>
I am sure that you would call me to order, Mr. Gale, if I were to run through the seven or eight pages covering the chronological sequence of the case, but I should like to mention three or four examples of the kinds of things that happened. I trust that all members of the Committee have received the outline of the case, and I checked with the Minister's officials that they received the briefing papers this morning.<br><br>
The council placed the child—who is, to put it crudely, highly attractive to potential adoptive parents because of its extremely young age—with foster parents while the process of finding adoptive parents dragged on and on. Those foster parents twice disappeared to India for long periods of time while the child was in the care of Islington. On the first occasion the foster parents simply left the child behind; on the second occasion they took it abroad for 12 weeks.<br><br>
Miss Vartanpour, who is a qualified adopter who has been accredited by a registered adoption agency, put herself forward for consideration to adopt the child. She was told that she—a single lady—and a mixed race couple were to be considered and were to go before an adoption panel early this year. A chapter of to-ing and fro-ing ensued. Finally, it turned out that the couple had withdrawn. Miss Vartanpour was then led to believe that she was going to be rejected. Fortunately, the adoption panel insisted that her case should be heard, but she was not given the opportunity to put her case to it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
After she had been rejected, she sent a long letter—some of the substance of which I have just shared with the Committee—to Islington. She received in return a very brief and not terribly well-worded reply, of which I shall refer to three aspects. Its first point is:
<br><blockquote><p>S did not drift in care.</p></blockquote>
If a child who is taken in at four months, has no prospect of returning to its natural parents and is still in care at the age of three, is not drifting in care, I seriously wonder what that means.<br><br>
Another point states:
<br><blockquote><p>The social workers were not influenced adversely or otherwise by your client's decision to write to the Secretary of State.</p></blockquote>
I hope that that is true. If there were to be an appeal, it could be taken into account.<br><br>
A third point is the bland statement:
<br><blockquote><p>Your client is not entitled to address the panel directly.</p></blockquote>
That is perfectly true under Islington's rules. However, many other councils, including Labour-controlled councils—this is not a party political point—allow potential adoptive parents to address the adoption panel. Why should they not?<br><br>
Before I turn to the second case, I should make it clear that I am not asking the Committee to take on board the rights and wrongs of a particular case. However, I took the trouble to ask the adoption forum to circulate the details of the case—anonymously, because for legal reasons I could not mention the woman's name until the proceedings began. The Minister's officials have had the details for some days. Is it right that no appeal is available to Miss Vartanpour outside Islington, apart from judicial review, which would be unbelievably expensive and which, in these circumstances, one would have no prospect of winning?<br><br>
You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Gale, that my description of the second case will be much briefer. I cannot, I am afraid, give the people's names, but I assure Committee members that the case is genuine. Mr. And Mrs. V had been married for several years and still hope to adopt, as does Miss Vartanpour, who came to me when her lawyer advised her that if she went public she was liable to be blacklisted by social services departments up and down the country. She is a brave lady who wants people to know what is going on in some social services departments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steve McCabe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely seek clarification about the cases in the hon. Gentleman's argument. Are there many cases that are similar to those that he quoted, or are those cases exceptional? I do not doubt his sincerity or the importance of the cases, but if they are not typical of large numbers of other cases, that would affect the judgment that one reaches about their importance in relation to legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention because he has reminded me of a point that I failed to make earlier. I had too many preambles at the start of my speech and I omitted a critical point, From time to time, the press contains allegations that there are many such cases. From my postbag, I am aware of about a dozen.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0409">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
The first case is unique because it involves someone who is still of adoptive age and in the system but who is willing to see her status as a registered potential adopter damaged in order to draw the public's attention to this disgraceful situation. In all of the other cases with which I have dealt, the participants said that they would be blacklisted and that no social services department would ever touch them again. The first case involves a woman who was cleared for adoption and who should have had a good chance of adopting a child. She is a single woman but she is of independent means and has a good record. My answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes, there are plenty of other cases, including about a dozen that are in my possession.<br><br>
The people in case two asked for their names not to be revealed. Committee members must take my word for it that the case is genuine. Mr. And Mrs. V had been married for several years and had sought medical treatment because they were infertile, but the treatment failed. They decided to adopt and got in touch with a local voluntary agency, and their assessment began. Both of them are overweight, but their GP was willing to write them a clean bill of health and pointed out that they were reasonably physically fit because they took quite a lot of exercise, including walking. Neither of them smokes or drinks or, critically, is on any kind of medication. They were willing to take a child of up to five years of age. However, they were constantly told that it was difficult to place four and five-year-olds, of whom there are many in care. Both Mr. And Mrs. V came from stable family backgrounds. Five months into their assessment, they were told that the agency's doctor had refused to sign their health certificate because
<br><blockquote><p>their body-mass index is too great.</p></blockquote>
I remember this case too well. When they asked the adopters, "Could you tell us in plain language—are you telling us that we are too fat?" they were told, "No, your body-mass index is too great." That may make us smile at this late hour, but it is rather sad that potential adopters who are offering a loving home should be rejected. They attempted to appeal but were told that no appeal was possible—having been rejected by one agency, they were told that it was very unlikely that they would be accepted by another. They approached the social services inspectorate of the Department of Health but heard the same story—there would be no appeal.<br><br>
Committee members have been patient in allowing me to develop my argument. I do not want to give a string of further anonymous cases—I expect that you, Mr. Gale, would tell me that I was stretching the rules of order if I did so. There is a huge gap in the law because there are only two forms of appeal: those that are within an authority, which involve asking a chief executive, in effect, to overrule his own social work department, which it is almost impossible to achieve, and those that are outside the local authority, which involve the system of judicial review, but that is a dead loss in these cases. Hardly anyone can afford it, no legal aid is available and, as I mentioned earlier, it is almost impossible to win a judicial review because of the burden of proof involved.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Humble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's presentation, and he has highlighted issues about which people have strong feelings.<br><br>
I wonder, however, whether the hon. Gentleman has examined the position from the point of view of the purpose of adoption. Its purpose is to provide children with families, rather than to provide adults with babies or children. In discussing those two cases with the individuals concerned, did he ask them how they saw their role and potential as adopters, and what kind of information and guidance they had been given. In particular, did he ask Miss Vartanpour whether she has been told that being approved as a potential adopter does not necessarily mean that one will get a child? There are stages before the appeal mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the hon. Lady. She is absolutely right. Miss Vartanpour—known as Mrs. A on the brief for legal reasons—has made it clear that she does not believe that any parent has a right to adopt a child, and nor would anyone in the adoption forum who provided this briefing material and originally put me in touch with her. No person has the right to adopt a child.<br><br>
The fact remains that, at a time when we are told that babies form the one group that it is relatively easy to place, it is disgraceful that a baby should drift through the system for three years. We are also told, quite accurately, that there is a national shortage of adoptive parents—there were about 1,300 the last time that I looked, compared with a vastly greater number of potentially adoptable children in care—and it is sad that couples should be rejected as potential adopters for apparently petty reasons.<br><br>
I return to the point I made earlier, I am not asking the Committee to take a view on whether those cases should have gone one way or the other in order to establish the case for my new clause. All that I have to establish, in order for the Committee to accept the principle behind the proposal, is that there is enough doubt in the circumstances for it to be right and proper that there should be an appeal mechanism.<br><br>
That brings me to my final point. I shall anticipate the Minister in a manner to which he always responds very courteously. Subsections (3), (4) and (5) would empower the commission to act as the appeal body, and I have no doubt that he will tell me that it would be a thoroughly inappropriate body to which to appeal, and that there are better ways of achieving our aim. I would welcome his telling me that. In order for the new clause to be in order, we had to make the commission the body to which appeals would be made. The Minister knows that there are better ways of structuring the appeal process, However, I put it to him that it is essential that social services departments should be answerable to someone, and that an appeal should be available in cases such as these. We owe that to the children concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Amess <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southend, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury and the right of appeal to the commission as contained in new clause 24. In so doing, I wish to pay tribute to the all-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
party adoption group and the leadership that my hon, Friend has given to it.<br><br>
The gift of new life is very precious. My wife and I have been blessed with it on a number of occasions. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) is also to be so blessed on Trafalgar day. However, there are huge numbers of people out there—I believe that the figure is one in six—who are unable to conceive, and who are desperate to adopt babies and children. Hon. Members feel strongly about such matters, and I realise that my views are in the minority as far as the present complexion of the House is concerned.<br><br>
For many people, this is an important matter. In the year to 31 March 1999, 2,200 under-ones were being cared for by the state. Of those babies, 770 had been in care for more than six months. I know that the Minister recognises such facts, and I hope that he will shortly have good news for the all-party adoption group. One of those dreadful summits, as they are now termed, has taken place at No. 10 Downing street, but perhaps some good will come of it on this occasion. Ministers may grimace, but many people think "summits" a somewhat misleading term.<br><br>
Some 200 adoptions of under-ones were completed in the year to 31 March 1999. Forty of the 2,200 under-ones in the care system were legally freed for adoption in that year, and 390 were in the preliminary-to-adoption category. However, delays in the adoption of babies are less easily explained, and are the cause of the frustration felt by many prospective adoptive parents who wish to appeal against certain decisions.<br><br>
Although a great slab of the Bill is devoted to appeals against local authority decisions on registering care places and people, it contains nothing that will give a right of appeal to individuals whose lives are deeply affected by local authority decisions. For example, there is no provision for independent appeal by systems users against such decisions. It is beyond doubt that there is a need to introduce a fair and open appeal system. At present, there is no power to overturn local authority decisions on the fate of children or adoptive foster parents in cases where, for example, a child is matched with an adopter.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury mentioned particular cases, and I shall do likewise. In a recent article in a national newspaper, entitled "Wrong shade of brown", Faisal Bodi explained how he inquired about a child who had been advertised for adoption. The child, who had been in temporary care for two years, is a Muslim boy of African Gambian stock. Mr. Bodi, who is a Pakistani Muslim, was told:
<br><blockquote><p>Because Mohammed has two African parents it would not be an ideal match.</p></blockquote>
The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> published an article on a report by Patricia Morgan of the Institute of Economic Affairs The report argued that an in-built hostility to adoption had resulted in a decline in the number of children who found new parents. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>Adoption is portrayed as being anti-child, anti-woman and anti-black, redistributing children from the poor to the middle class.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
That inevitably brought a strong rebuttal from social workers, but regardless of the argument, in the three years since, hundreds of children who might otherwise have found a family have been condemned to a life in care. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury and I want to establish the appeal process.<br><br>
Finally, I refer Committee members to the words of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>One of our two sons has adopted two little boys. He and his wife could not have children of their own so they set out on the long and difficult journey of adoption.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We shared this journey with them and learned a lot. We learned, for example, that it is not easy to adopt.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>English adoption laws are very tough and who were amazed by the rigorous examination of the two young people to make sure they were up to adoption … By such high standards those of us who have had children of our own would have failed time and again. Those who adopt are motivated by love.</p></blockquote>
I fully recognise how careful authorities have to be in that regard, but that does not explain why more than 770 babies have been in care for more than six months. People who wish to adopt babies or children are frustrated when they are turned down. I hope that the Minister will take my argument seriously. If he feels that the new clause does not fit easily into the Bill, perhaps there may be an opportunity on Report to examine the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on the new clause, which is not, on my reading of it, specifically about adoption rather, it involves a more general appellate function for the commission I am sure that the hon. Member for Canterbury will accept that I cannot agree to the new clause because the role that it envisages for the National Care Standards Commission is at odds with that which we have in mind for it.<br><br>
In essence—I do not seek to summarise the arguments that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) put to the Committee—the suggestion is that the current complaints procedures are woefully inadequate and that we should examine the way in which the systems work. That is what we are doing. Earlier, in response to an amendment that was tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, I said that last week, I believe, we issued a consultation exercise that was designed to improve the operation of social services complaints procedures. The relevant concerns can be properly aired and addressed in that process. If the hon. Members for Canterbury and for Southend, West have any particular concerns about the way in which the complaints procedure is operating, I should be happy to send them a copy of the consultation document, and they could pursue their concerns in writing with the Department.<br><br>
The hon. Gentlemen overlooked one or two aspects of the complaints procedure. The hon. Member for Canterbury summarised the complaints procedure rather inaccurately. He overlooked specific provisions that relate to the ombudsman's role. The ombudsman has the competence and jurisdiction to intervene in some cases. The Bill will require voluntary adoption agencies to operate effective complaints procedures for prospective parents, which will be a welcome

innovation. My instinct is that the hon. Gentlemen want primary legislation about adoption procedures. We shall shortly make an announcement about how we intend to take forward work in that area. We have made no secret of the fact that more children could be adopted more quickly and more effectively but that some of the essential features of the child protection safeguards to which reference has been made could be kept in place. We cannot engineer a situation in which we would be handing out children willy nilly to people who would be completely unsuitable to act as parents. I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen recognise that there has to be a proper system for assessment.<br><br>
I have said on numerous occasions that the whole system needs a proper shake up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The central point is that all of the mechanisms that the Minister described, save one, are internal to local authorities. The one external mechanism that he mentioned, the ombudsman, cannot change decisions, he can only comment on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I was not trying to misrepresent the ombudsman's role in this context. We need to bear in mind that oversight in the process. My instinct is that the changes that the hon. Members for Canterbury and for Southend, West want would be better placed in the framework of a new set of legislative proposals about adoption. I am sure that we shall continue to debate that matter in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Amess</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there any chance of introducing that legislation before the general election? Is the Department bidding for a place in the new legislative programme? There are huge numbers of people out there who are desperate to find out whether the Government are serious about that legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been around this place much longer than I have, and he knows precisely the position that I am in. I am unable to announce legislation, either for the next Session or for the final Session of this Parliament. I do not make those decisions, although I sometimes wish that I did. The view that the Government have taken on the way forward for adoption will be shared with the hon. Gentleman and all hon. Members very soon. I hope that he and his hon. Friends will feel that the Government are proceeding on a time scale with which they can be satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, may I say that I very much look forward to seeing the Minister on Thursday week at the all-party adoption group? I understand that he will then have some interesting things to tell us, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 533, in page 65, line 27, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and in accordance with the principles of best value.'.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
We are seeking to be consistent with the debate that we had on clause 43, in proposing to impose a duty on an authority to carry out its functions in accordance with best value. The Minister gave a verbal assurance that that would be the case, although I remember him saying that best value had come into effect only in April and that there were therefore no examples of its taking place. Given that verbal assurance, we wish to see the provision incorporated into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure that the hon. Member for Meriden has understood the amendment that she has tabled.<br><br>
There are two main principles behind best value. The first is that best value authorities should seek to deliver their services economically, efficiently and effectively. However, that is precisely what paragraph 4 of schedule 1 already requires. It would clearly be nonsense to amend the paragraph to read "it is the duty of an authority to carry out its functions effectively, efficiently and economically in accordance with the principles of delivering services effectively, efficiently and economically", although that would be the effect of the amendment. I am sure that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would raise a grammatical eyebrow at that construction.<br><br>
The second key principle of best value is continuous improvement. Under section 3 of the Local Government Act 1999, best value authorities are already required to put in place arrangements to secure continuous improvement. Those arrangements include reviewing all services every five years and producing annual best value performance plans. They have to be carried out in accordance with guidance under sections 5 and 6 of the Local Government Act, and include assessing performance against statutory best value performance indicators. However, best value authorities are set out in section 1 of the Local Government Act. They are essentially authorities that provide or commission services for users and carers.<br><br>
The National Care Standards Commission and the General Social Care Council will not provide services directly to the public. It would, therefore, make no sense to apply the best value performance arrangements or indicators to them. Of course, we want to ensure that the commission and the council strive for continuous improvement. Both will be non-departmental public bodies, and both will be accountable to the Secretary of State. They will operate within an agreed performance management framework. They will have to present the Secretary of State with annual reports and, additionally, at the end of each financial year, they will have to submit copies of their accounts to the Secretary of State and to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will examine and certify them. The accounts will then be laid before Parliament along with the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports.<br><br>
There will, therefore, be mechanisms in place to ensure that the performance of the commission and the council is closely monitored, and those bodies will be required to achieve improvements in performance year on year. I hope that I have managed to persuade the hon. Lady that the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to persuade me that the amendment is redundant. We were seeking reinforcement for the verbal assurances that he gave when we debated previous clauses. He has repeated the same assurances that he gave then. I understood the principles of best value to be slightly wider than in his interpretation. Those principles are important in relation to the way in which an authority will be expected to carry out its functions. However, we shall have to accept the Minister's verbal assurance on this matter, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 66, line 34, at end insert—</span></p>
<p><i>'Older Persons' Rights Director</i></p>
<p>11.—(1) The Commission shall appoint an older persons' rights director who is to be a member of staff of the Commission.</p>
<p>(2) The older persons' rights director shall have such functions as may be prescribed.'.</p>
<p>The amendment is intended to probe the Government's willingness to extend the idea of a children's rights director to older people. He or she would be an advocate—we earlier debated the meaning of that word—who could focus on the needs of vulnerable older people in the various care settings that will be dealt with by the National Care Standards Commission.</p>
<p>I could have analysed the results of the study of elder abuse that was conducted by Action on Elder Abuse and published earlier this year, but I shall save those comments for another time. The evidence coming from that quarter and from others is that while it is acknowledged that there is a real problem of child abuse in this country—we are dealing with that problem in various ways—we have not properly accepted that older people can be abused, physically, psychologically or financially. We need to deal with the problem more rigorously. The amendment is intended to establish whether the Government are prepared to accept that the commission could play a useful role in this regard.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I welcome the hon. Gentleman's amendment, which highlights an important matter. He does not need to labour the fact that the Government and local authorities consistently fail to recognise the instances of and the potential for elder abuse, although there is a growing recognition of the issue's importance. We, our partners in local authorities and others have taken steps, with Action on Elder Abuse, to provide new guidance to local authorities about how to tackle such issues. We launched new proposals recently that required local authorities to put in place their own mechanisms for dealing with complaints of abuse from older people. The hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that we do not take this matter seriously—we do. We have put significant resources and much time and effort into working with various organisations and we have sought to put in place more effective systems to care
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
for vulnerable and older people in various care settings, including care homes.<br><br>
We do not want to add to the Bill the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the commission should, in effect, appoint a director for every relevant client group. Special circumstances apply to the establishment of the position of the children's rights director. If the commission chose to do so, it could appoint someone to do such work—it will be able to appoint such directors as seem to it to be appropriate. There will be one director for private health care and one for children's rights, and the commission may want to appoint someone to deal with older person's rights. However, that is a decision for the commission. The rationale behind the establishment of a private health care director and a children's rights director has been well rehearsed in Committee, and I do not need to do so again.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting suggestion that we shall consider carefully and keep under review as the establishment of the commission unfolds during the next 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burstow</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting response. I shall return to this matter and dwell on it in more detail on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may consider Government amendment No. 274.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 274, which is purely a technical amendment, will apply section 144 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 to the Care Council for Wales. Section 144 of the 1998 Act gives the Secretary of State for Wales the power to make provisions for accounts, auditing and so on for the Care Council for Wales. As schedule 1 already makes provision for these matters, the amendment disapplies section 144 in respect of the council. The amendment is a purely technical amendment to avoid unnecessary duplication.</span></p>

<ol>

<li>after subsection (5) there shall be inserted—</li>
<ul>
<li>"(6) In this section "independent hospital" and "care home" have the same meanings as in the Care Standards Act 2000.'".</li>
</ul></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 498 to 529, No. 531, No. 530, No. 532 and No. 477.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is long group of amendments, and it might assist the Committee if I run through their effects.<br><br>
Amendment No. 497 amends section 1 of the National Assistance Act 1948 so that local authorities may make arrangements only with care homes that are registered under part II of the Bill, and must have the prior consent of the health authority before making arrangements with a care home that provides nursing care.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 499 to 501 make changes to the amendments to the Adoption Act 1976 already provided for in schedule 3. Amendment No. 501, in particular, ensures that regulations can be made that provide for offences by adoption agencies that are local authorities—a point that was discussed during earlier stages of the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 497, 502 to 508, 522 and 525 deal with mental health issues, and apply to a range of Acts. The amendments are slightly more complex, because existing legislation uses the definition of "mental nursing home" in the Registered Homes Act 1984, which covers the complete range of institutions from those that provide only nursing care to acute hospitals. The new arrangements in the Bill provide for the concepts of single care home, which may provide different types of nursing or personal care, and of independent hospitals, which would include hospitals that provide psychiatric care.<br><br>
Our approach in these consequential amendments has therefore been, in the main, to replace references to "mental nursing home" with
<br><blockquote><p>independent hospital or care home—</p></blockquote>
which will encompass the range of institutions covered by the old definition.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
Amendments Nos. 510 and 511 amend section 24 of the Children Act 1989—on the basis that we do not know whether the Care Standards Bill or the Children (Leaving Care) Bill will be commenced first—to update the references in section 24 to children's homes and care homes.<br><br>
Amendment No. 512 amends the definition of voluntary children's homes in the Children Act to reflect the definition in clause 1 of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 513, 514 and 519 introduce new section 65A into the Children Act. It deals with the right to appeal against disqualifications from carrying on or being employed in children's homes under section 65, and makes some tidying amendments to the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 517 includes an update to the sidenote to section 87 of the 1989 Act. It reflects the substance of amendment No. 486, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.<br><br>
Amendment No. 518 provides a definition of an independent hospital for the purposes of the 1989 Act.<br><br>
Amendment No. 521 updates the reference to care homes in schedule 8 to the 1989 Act, so that children who are in care homes or independent hospitals are not counted as private foster children.<br><br>
Most of the remaining schedule 3 amendments simply ensure that, wherever references are made in existing legislation to registered care homes, nursing homes and mental nursing homes, they are updated to refer to care homes and independent hospitals, and remove references to repealed legislation.<br><br>
The schedule 5 amendments contain various minor repeals, again mostly concerned with removing references to repealed legislation and associated definitions.<br><br>
Amendment No. 477 is an amendment to the long title, reflecting the fact that the Bill now provides for the regulation of nurses' agencies.</span></p>
