	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned this morning, I was explaining some of my background to the Committee in the context of the speeches of the Opposition Whip. I was seeking to illustrate how trade unions have changed with the times, reflecting the century upon which we are embarking. I was explaining that during my long time as an active trade unionist I had on occasions used the block votes to which the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) referred. I fully understand the expert view of the use of such votes both within trade unions and the Labour party. He is aware from his study of more recent history that trade unions have embarked upon a series of changes that alter their relationship with the political party. The existence of those changes, which are well embodied in the rules of the Labour party and have taken place voluntarily within the affiliated trade unions, means that the hon. Gentleman's attempt to paint the relationship between the trade unions and the Labour party as the same as it was 20 or 30 years ago is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his previous incarnation, the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) described events that occurred at least 20 years ago in Newham constituency. One acknowledges that from time to time relationships have come under strain because of attempts to push the rules to the boundary. From my equally long experience of friends in the Conservative party, I know that that is true within that party as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Dorset acknowledged that there was a varying relationship between Conservative clubs and the Conservative party. In my constituency there is a Conservative club in the heart of the strongest Labour ward in the town. I admit to my hon. Friends sitting behind me that I entered the premises on one occasion and I am told by friends who are members of the club that they were not knowingly members of the Conservative party, but joined because the club had the best snooker tables. That seems a sensible basis on which to join the club, whereas its links with the Conservative party are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Walter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) beg the question: is he trying to suggest
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
that the links with the Labour party that we described—and that Neill described as recently as 1996—no longer exist? Are there no longer trade unions or hon. Members affiliated to the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there are affiliated trade unions and long may that remain. I am sure that every one of my hon. Friends will agree. The process of affiliation is based on rules of individual unions and it is not for the Committee to interfere. That is neither the purpose of the Bill, nor a sound remit for the House. A number of mistakes were made in the previous Parliament by interfering with the rulebooks of trade unions. I am saying that that relationship is not the one that the hon. Member for North Dorset described, which I openly acknowledge existed in the early years. He is wrong, because his history needs to be brought up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The political levy that members voluntarily pay does not necessarily reflect an immediate affiliation to the Labour party. Some unions that have political levies are not affiliated to the Labour party because of previous statutes. If a union chooses by balloting its members to affiliate, the size of the affiliation is determined by each union. Different unions have different approaches to that and the decisions of groups of members are, on occasion, surprising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the United Commercial Travellers Association—a longstanding trade union going back to before the beginning of the century, whose patron was the first Lord Leverhulme—took a decision to transfer allegiance to ASTMS, the recommendation of its executive, hardly a left-wing organisation, was that their members should contribute to the political levy because the money would be used to influence Governments. It was recognised at the time—and I am sure that Members from all parties and all trade unions would recognise now—that in those days, when the late Clive Jenkins was general secretary, the union had a significant influence on Governments of both persuasions. The UCTA executive made that recommendation because it saw a value in the use of the political fund. It had nothing to do with individual members' wishes to be personally linked to the Labour party. That is an entirely different state of affairs and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the amendment may have been worthy of examination before these transitions started to take place, but it is now irrelevant. The wording of subsection (8) will stand the test of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important debate and it has not been conducted in a partisan way. The issue was discussed on Second Reading when the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young), the shadow Leader of the House, pursued it with some vigour. I am sure that my hon. Friends will remember the response of my right hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien). We now have the opportunity to examine the matter in more depth and detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Before I come to the key issues, let me try and answer the peripheral questions that relate to subsections (8)(b) and (c). First, (8)(c) excludes
	<br><q><p>"any other organisation of a description prescribed by order made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the Commission."</p></q>
I was asked earlier to what that referred. I have to confess that this is something of a reserve power—a belt and braces power. There are no organisations targeted at the moment, although there may be some that could be included in this section. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) mentioned this morning, there is a working party on implementing the Bill and that is an area for discussion. There are no hard and fast rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been considering this point and there is certainly one organisation that I should like to see in that category. Most political parties are associated with trading companies of various kinds. Their names appear on the brass plaques on their front doors. That certainly applies to two parties here, but I am not sure about the Liberal Democrats. If such a company were registered overseas, in my view it would fit into that category in subsection (8)(c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to examine the point in detail. Clearly, if the company is registered overseas and does not trade in the United Kingdom, it already does not have the opportunity to make contributions as a donor and will not in future be able to make contributions. Clearly, consultation has already started. Subsection (8)(b) defines friendly societies and we have heard about the possibility of a North Dorset friendly society being formed. Bodies that fall into this category are typically social clubs, as has already been mentioned. The Opposition party will debate among themselves the strengths and weaknesses of Conservative clubs. It seems to be a rather touchy subject, but one area we need to consider is the relationship between not just Conservative clubs but independent social clubs which pass a donation to a party. That is the remit of subsection (8)(b) and (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for North Dorset mentioned the Neill committee and quoted from its report. It is clear that the Neill committee looked at trade unions and their operation in some detail. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston pointed out that trade unions had changed substantially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman enlighten me on the question of friendly societies? Is there something within the registration provision of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and the 1969 Northern Ireland legislation that places friendly societies in a similar category to trade unions in terms of the regulation of their ability to make political donations or turn themselves into an affiliated organisation? If there is, I cam understand why they should be placed in a special category along with trade unions. If there is not, I do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on that point and reply to the hon. Gentleman later in my speech. I was saying
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
that the Neill committee had looked in detail at trade unions and I acknowledged that they were changing. My impression—I believe that it is the general view of the Neill committee—is that the trade union movement was given a fair bill of health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment changes
	<br><q><p>"none of the following shall"</p></q>
to "the following may" because that is a permissive power rather than a prescriptive one. Had the hon. Gentleman been partisan on that point, I would have expected the amendment to suggest the phrase "the following will". The phrase "the following may" is some recognition that there is an issue here, and indeed there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot disguise the fact that there are trade unions that are affiliated to the Labour party and, according to its constitution, are regarded as part of the party. If that were not so, the question of their inclusion in or exclusion from the party's schemes simply would not arise. It is also a fact—we are transparent on this point—that the Labour party receives substantial, albeit declining sums of money from trade unions. Those sums are properly and openly raised and accounted for under distinct statutory arrangements, which exist for that purpose. I assure the Committee that there is nothing underhand or of a party political nature in our consideration of this matter. I want to persuade the Committee that the opposite is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) asked what the position would be if his amendment fell. He asked about the nature of the relationship. If affiliated trade unions were included within the schemes for regulating parties' affairs for the purposes of the Bill, there would be two main consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first, and minor, consequence is that, if trade unions were not outwith the schemes all their financial affairs would have to be included, not just those relating to political activity. Trade unions have changed enormously. Many trade unions now do a great deal of their work around common law claims. Some of the income of the trade union movement comes from insurance schemes and from financial advice and services. That is an indication of the change in the nature of trade unions. However, if we were not to exclude trade unions, all that trading activity would have to be included within the provisions. It cannot be right that such major activities should be accounted for and under the responsibility of somebody who has no say in them. It is a practical issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second consequence is more important. The party would not be obliged to declare donations from a trade union were it not for this clause. The movement of the money would be on a par with, for example, transferring funds within the party from a constituency association to central headquarters. Without this part of the Bill, there would be no clarity and no transparency in respect of the nature of the relationship or the donation to the political party, the Labour party. That is an important principle. It must be right, I have no doubt that people need to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
know how much money is coming to the Labour party from the trade union movement. If we were to accept the amendment, that would not be the case. We are on strong ground. It is better to know the nature and the amount of the transaction rather than that money should pass through the organisation without notice being given to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will reassure Committee members. I know that the matter is important to them. I do not seek to dissuade them from putting the amendment to a vote, but I hope that hon. Members will be reassured by the two reasons that I have given—that the other trading activities of the trade union movement would have to be recognised and accounted for, and, more importantly, that subsection (8) establishes clearly, transparently and openly for all to see the nature of the relationship and the amount of money involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on the amendment. I acknowledge that the Minister was not surprised that we raised that issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) referred to Conservative clubs. The comparison between Conservative clubs and trade unions may be slightly spurious, although I would reflect on the fact that my constituency has two Conservative clubs, neither of which, to my recollection, has made any financial contribution to the Conservative party. However, some years ago, I had the good fortune to contest a Parliamentary seat in South Wales against the present European Commissioner, Mr. Neil Kinnock, which had four Conservative clubs. One was the pithead social club at the Britannia colliery at Aberbargoed which did make a contribution to the Conservative party, I am pleased to say, and also served a very good pint of beer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to conclude from that that the number of Conservative clubs contributing to the party is directly related to the fall in the Conservative vote in any particular constituency? If so, may I encourage the hon. Gentleman to do more to develop Conservative clubs throughout the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to raise more funds for the Conservative party we might seek to create more Conservative clubs in Labour-held seats. I look forward to the expansion in Glasgow of our Conservative club representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A pig is flying by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt we shall debate Conservative clubs when we come to clause 64 on members associations. Those clubs that require people to be a member of the party as a prerequisite for being a member of the club may be covered by that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston mentioned the changing nature of trade unions and the fact that they were no longer the significant influence in the Labour party that they were. The statistics from Neill to which I referred applied to when we did not have a Labour Government; they were from 1996, when I suspect that the trade unions had more influence than they might have today. Now that Labour is in government, control comes from the centre and the block vote does not influence the policy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
of those who reside in Downing street as much as it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister acknowledged that in the past this might have been an issue, but that we cannot extend the remit of the Electoral Commission to trade unions because they are also involved in other activities. However, according to the Neill statistics, 3.5 million members of the Labour party have become affiliated by virtue of their trade union membership. If you accept that they are members of the Labour party, which is how they regard themselves—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] Well, if one adds them to the direct members of the party, it means that about 90 per cent. of the membership are not covered by the provisions of the Bill because they are affiliated through their trade union organisations. If we are to have transparent legislation, the creation of those political funds should come within the remit of the Electoral Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second argument was about transparency. He suggested that it was more transparent for us simply to look at the money passing from the political funds of the trade union to the Labour party—I assume that is the only party about which we are talking here—rather than the way it is collected and spent within the trade unions. That would be fine if the trade unions did not operate their political funds internally as well as passing money to the Labour party and if they did not have their own political campaigns in support of Labour policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trade unions are regulated by their own legislation. Neill considered that and, by and large, gave it a clean bill of health. If trade unions themselves campaign away from the Labour party once the Bill becomes law, they will become third-party campaigners in their own right and therefore liable to provisions that we shall discuss later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for clarifying and for confirming that the trade union legislation introduced in the past 20 years is now working well and that they are now acting in a much healthier environment. We can congratulate them and the Government who introduced the legislation. I do not wish to be partisan; it is simply a fact that these are members of the Labour party and I am concerned that we shall be leaving them out of the equation when the Electoral Commission is considering the activities of political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made a significant point on the provision, but I sense that the Government are not minded to accept our amendment and, therefore, beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Stunell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hazel Grove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 15, line 30, leave out 'the party's being confused by voters' and insert
	<br><q><p>'electors confusing that party.'</p></q>
I hope that this straightforward amendment will achieve two things—improve the syntax of the clause, which is perhaps a trivial point, and substitute "electors" for "voters". There is a significant difference between the two terms numerically and confusion could be caused in respect of registered names. I shall not dwell on the first point, as
	<br><q><p>"the party's being confused by voters"</p></q>
is ambiguous. I have been confused by voters often, but whether I confuse them is perhaps a moot point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Linton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said he wished to improve the syntax, but he is substituting incorrect syntax for correct syntax. "Being confused" as used in the clause is actually a verbal noun and, therefore, the noun preceding it has to take the genitive as in "the party's". What is now proposed may be less confusing, but it is incorrect, so I see no merit in the amendment from a syntactical point of view or, indeed, for the difference between "voters" and "electors". Only voters' confusion is of any importance in the voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. It is good to know that one is never too old to learn. The drafting point is of secondary importance, and normally I would not detain the Committee with such points. The distinction between "voters" and "electors" is often not made either, when we speak and or when we legislate. It is a matter of turning up at the ballot box and being confused about a misleading name. In general terms, it means turning up as a potential voter—in other words, as an elector—and being confused about the meaning of the words "the party's being".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may want to say that the confusion is no more or less for electors who do not choose to vote than it is for voters who go to the polling station and are potentially confused, but we need to consider the impact of confusion in generating not only abstentions but people voting for the wrong party on the ballot paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it is a matter of style and drafting and, at the risk of alienating my hon.

My advice to the Committee is to agree the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EMBLEMS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 16, line 7, leave out 'three' and insert 'six'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 16, in page 16, line 7, leave out 'three' and insert 'four'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 7, in clause 26, page 16, line 34, leave out 'three' and insert 'six'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 7 is consequential on amendment No. 6. I note that there is a similar amendment with a different figure. Our amendment suggests raising the number of emblems permitted from three to six; the other suggests raising it to four. I understand that permission was granted in earlier legislation to take account of the fact that political parties had subsidiary parts, if that is not too anti-federal, in Scotland, Wales and England where they might wish to have three different symbols.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will have elections fairly shortly for the mayor of the London Assembly. We had elections last year to the European Parliament, when parties used different symbols. As a matter of mere practicality, rather than allowing any number of emblems or restricting it to the existing three, we felt that it made sense to allow a reasonable number of emblems given the forthcoming elections in England, in the whole of the United Kingdom, in Scotland for the Scottish Parliament, in Wales for the Welsh Assembly and possibly in Northern Ireland. The Conservative party has Conservative associations in Northern Ireland that contest Northern Ireland parliamentary seats. As our parties become somewhat less centrally controlled, perhaps with the exception of the Labour party, we should permit the use of other symbols. Six seems a reasonable number to insert in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment standing in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) would insert "four" instead of "three". There were three emblems to take account of the situation in Scotland and Wales when the original legislation came into force. Since then, events have moved forward significantly in Northern Ireland, for which we all give thanks—we all hope that that will be sustained. The purpose of our amendment is simply to allow the possibility of a further emblem being added for the Province, should events move forward in the way we all hope they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangements have worked well. They have not created confusion. They have allowed a sensible differentiation to be made—for instance, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats standing in Scotland and the Welsh Liberal Democrats standing in Wales, where there is also a bilingual issue. This seemed to us to be an opportunity to move forward and allow for the consequences of the successful fulfilment of the Northern Ireland peace process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a larger number. I do not object to a limited larger number if it is seen as convenient, but it would not produce any practical benefit in the circumstances that I have described. I do not honestly think that Liberal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
Democrats in Surrey would want to campaign with a different symbol from that of Liberal Democrats in London, but I acknowledge that others might want to do that. Judging from recent events, some parties might want to use two symbols in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has given any thought to what design symbol the Hazel Grove bypass group might use. I ask because I want to alert the New Mills anti-Hazel Grove bypass group to that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemen and I could indulge in a very interesting parochial discussion about the merits or otherwise of road schemes in north Derbyshire and south-east Greater Manchester, but I suspect that, if we did so, you would quickly rule us out of order, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recognise that allowing a limited number of symbols is sensible; otherwise, an unscrupulous party might register 6,000 different emblems, effectively taking all the available trademarks. It is clearly sensible to have a limited number, but it should be a practical number which takes account of the political circumstances within the United Kingdom. I hope that our amendment will find favour with the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to contribute only briefly to the debate. Having listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's speech, I can see the force of his argument. We feel that this is likely to be an expanding issue. It is all very well for the Government to be the motor force behind various policies on devolution and regionalism, but that must make it likely that local parties will want to assert a separate identity while also retaining the identity of the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will give this suggestion some consideration. Six is not an excessive number, although if we end up with regional assemblies—which I do not wish to see—we will end up needing rather more than six. However, the possibility of six emblems provides a reserve. If necessary, it would allow for a separate identity in European elections which could be linked to a common identity with other European parties or groups with which one was affiliated. In those circumstances, six seems to be a reasonable number for now. Failing that, four would be better than three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a history to this issue, as well as a possible solution. During the passage of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, from which sections of the Bill are drawn, the original proposal was that it should be one party, one emblem. However, representations were made and the number of possible emblems was increased to three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments advocate six and four emblems. The fact that drives the issue forward is the devolution of power and the creation of new or different parties in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—perhaps there will be English parties as well. I can see that there will be a desire for each to have its own emblem. Hon. Members will recall that, earlier, I committed the Government to introducing amendments allowing individual parties to be set up in each country under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
a federal banner. When we have brought forward such amendments and individual parties in individual countries can establish themselves in their own right, they will of course also acquire the right to have three emblems of their own. Potentially, a party with different organisational units or different parties in different parts of the country would be able to have 12 emblems. The amendments are therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a practical issue for politicians and marketeers—the two are not always distinct. The need to identify clearly name, image and emblem was a driving force behind the 1998 Act. Business and party managers will have to think hard about having a potential choice of up to 12. Given our assurance that we shall table new clauses and amendments to allow parties to establish individual parties in different parts of the country, the amendment is unnecessary. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's comments about amendments yet to be tabled on federal party structures. However, I am anxious that, in order to facilitate our amendment's objective, we would be forced to create a federal party structure. Even if a federal party structure were created and—heaven forbid—the Government introduced regional assemblies in England, there would still be too few symbols unless the English parties were federated as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is scope to examine the issue when we scrutinise the amendments on federal party structures. As I said earlier in relation to the Scottish and Welsh Conservative parties, we are not uninterested in that. I therefore beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Maxton, but I am not clear whether my amendment was being withdrawn as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain. When amendments are grouped together, only the lead amendment is moved. Should the hon. Member moving a grouped amendment wish to a vote, he may move it formally at the appropriate point and a vote would be taken. However, the hon. Gentleman's amendment does not have to be withdrawn. If he wishes to make a point in the stand part debate, I am quite happy for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I appreciate being put right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Minister being so emollient, Conservative Members risk being lulled into a false sense of security. I appreciate his approach, especially on federalism. However, once or twice I was convinced that the finer points of that theological doctrine escape him. No doubt, we can come to terms with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government amendment on federalism allowing 12 or some multiple of three emblems would be an interesting codicil to my understanding of federalism.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
However, let us leave that aside for the moment. If we can make progress on a broad front, a number of issues—of which emblems are of some, but not the most, important—could be tackled at the same time. If the Minister reassures us that the Government will give such matters serious, detailed consideration, take advice and table the best possible amendments, I am happy to accept the clause. However, I give notice that, if the smooth words that turned away wrath so successfully do not produce the results that we want, there will be trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why must black-and-white representations be specified under subsection (3)? I understand that limitations might exist in the printing of ballot papers. That might be a good explanation now, but it might be wise to allow the commission to reconsider such matters in future, especially if many parties take part in an election. I had the pleasure of being in Venice a few years ago during an Italian election in which dozens of parties stood. A simple way in which voters could distinguish between those parties was by looking at the registered clearly coloured insignia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reference has been made to your athletic powers, Mr. Maxton, and the suggestion was made that I was not a capable gymnast. I have four miles under my belt already this morning. In the light of the comments made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that I am perhaps too emollient, I shall get myself fit and eat some steak during the weekend. Before the next sitting, I shall read the 	<i>Official Report</i> conscientiously. I have given a commitment that we shall table amendments on Report to recognise the federal structure of parties. That will be the day of reckoning, and I hope that we shall be able to accommodate the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston asked why the specification is black and white. There are as yet no plans to change the fact that ballot papers are printed in black and white in the United Kingdom, although we suspect, as he does, that a change may be possible in future, given new technology and techniques.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 9, in schedule 3, page 103, line 11, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(2A) Any fee prescribed in accordance with subparagraph (2) above shall not exceed the actual cost to public funds of that application.'.</p></q>

No. 10, in schedule 3, page 104, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(2A) Any fee prescribed in accordance with subparagraph (2) above shall not exceed the actual cost to public funds of that application.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to the potential for making it exceedingly difficult for new parties to emerge, gain registration and become an active part of the body politic. The amendment would limit the power of the Secretary of State or the Electoral Commission to charge a fee that would inhibit the ability of small parties to become active.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not see fit to accept earlier amendments that would have allowed bodies, such as the perhaps now legendary Hazel Grove action group, to advertise themselves on the ballot paper, so party registration is inevitable and unavoidable for many of them even though they lack resources. It is important that the three people sitting around the coffee table on Saturday afternoons are not faced with an elaborate and perhaps bureaucratic process that is costly and difficult to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments would have the same effect for different parts of the registration process. Subsection (5) includes the words
	<br><q><p>"accompanied by any fee prescribed by order made by the Secretary of State",</p></q>
and the amendments would limit that power. I want to hear the Minister's response. Do the Government accept our view that the best means of enabling and facilitating democratic participation—sometimes at our own expense, as in my experience of the Hazel Grove action group, and even when it is inconvenient to we big boys who succeeded in making it here—is to provide for a transparent and inexpensive process? I regret that the Minister made no exceptions earlier in the debate. It must be made easier to go through the formal process of setting up a party, with all the encumbrances that it brings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, this part of the Bill draws on the 1998 Act. The true fee for initial application for registration is £150 and the charge to alter an entry in the register is £25. Those are the actual costs. The Government do not want an electoral commission that gains much of its income through the registration process. The commission has better things to do and will be properly resourced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to one of the prominent themes throughout our debate—ensuring that the proposals will work. Although power is vested in the Secretary of State, there is no intention to gaining income from the charges. As I said, the initial charge will be £150 with a further £25 to alter an entry. The cost of working out the registration costs may be greater than the current amounts. I hope that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will reflect further. I am not trying to be emollient, but merely assuring him that there is no intention of using the provisions as a revenue-raising power. The amendments are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stunell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. If the Hazel Grove action group cannot have its name on the ballot paper without paying £150, it will not do so. That may relieve the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
and, indeed, me. However, it remains a problem that what suits us does not necessarily suit the democratic system in its finer points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a vote, but I want to put it on record that we are actively seeking to raise the threshold of active participation in democracy. It is convenient for us when it favours the larger regulated parties. Members of the Committee in this Room would be happy if there remained only three political parties. If I left, they would be happy to work with only two. Fine, but that is not the best system for this country. Democracy is not solely a function for large political parties. It is also a function for the small people—those with a local cause and a bee in their bonnets. We need to ensure that, as far as possible, we avoid charges that deter them from participating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear what the Minister says. I understand that this is an existing cost. I recognise that all future Secretaries of State will be reasonable and that the Electoral Commission will not try to exclude anyone on account of price. However, I return to my former point: these legislative proposals will probably last for 100 years, and not all Secretaries of State, Ministers and political parties in this place will be as emollient and well intentioned as the Minister. I want to make it clear that I remain uneasy about what we are doing for that democratic participation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PARTY CEASING TO BE REGISTERED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>3.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister for clarification. I agree with what is in the Bill. Much of it echoes what would be in the Companies Act. For example, where a party had applied to be taken from the register and had made the necessary declarations, it would cease to be registered as a political party; none the less, for a number of years thereafter, it would be subject to the provisions in all other parts of the Bill in terms of its financial propriety, the making of returns and so on. We can envisage the reason for that. A political party could fight an election, run up an enormous overdraft as it ran to the end of its accounting year, go into liquidation, as it were, and receive an enormous foreign donation to wipe out the debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take that a step further, which is why I require clarification. In that scenario, a group of supporters of that party, whatever it was called—it might be called the Referendum party, although that has gone out of business—could come along and say, "But we still believe in the causes of the party," and then apply to re-form the party. How does the Minister envisage the Electoral Commission dealing with this matter? Because those people had been ordinary volunteer members of the party, they might want to use a name that evoked the Referendum
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
party's philosophy, although in the commission's eyes that party was in liquidation. Would they have to rename the party the "Referendum party 2001", or whatever, as happens when one tries to re-register a company name, or does the Minister envisage some other provision operating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point about what we might call a phoenix party. I believe that he envisages a party going out of business, giving a commitment to the commission that it will not stand again, perhaps for avoidance purposes, and then, in a sense, a group of outsiders coming in and trying to take over the soul—raise the phoenix—of the party. As I understand it, the commission would have to insist that the new party met all the provisions of the Bill. There would need to be three members in responsible posts and it would have to agree a scheme with the commission. The principle point would be ownership of the name. It is the name and the ability to put up candidates that define the political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no easy solution, although I suspect that I am being offered a solution. As I understand it, once a party has had its entry removed from the register, it will no longer have a claim to the name. Newcomers could conceivably resurrect the name and establish a new party. I have some uneasiness about the matter and the hon. Gentleman will understand that I must reflect on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the point further and ask my hon. Friend to reflect on what might happen in the scenario described by the hon. Member for North Dorset to the liabilities of that party? Would people who, from a perfectly legitimate standpoint, wanted to reform it and to re-register the original logo under their names as new party leaders inherit the liabilities which he described? This is a tortuous area and it needs some careful consideration. On the one hand, it could disfranchise legitimate party members who have been ripped off by someone who has disappeared with the money and left huge liabilities; on the other, it could be used as a vehicle to subvert the intentions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might flag up another possibility. We have spoken in terms of a party that might dissolve or come to an end, but a party might decide to cease campaigning because it had achieved its purpose. In those circumstance, there would be no point in the party remaining as a single-issue party. Three years later, however, the whole issue might be raised again and the party might wish to resurrect itself. It might not be able to do so, quite legitimately, because it had lost its right to its name and logo. In those circumstances, should a party pay the full amount every year to re-register when it is in a state of dormancy or should there be a device by which it can maintain itself even though it is not campaigning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would, of course, be possible for a party to lie dormant. It would have to meet the requirements of the Bill in terms of returns and registration, but, having achieved its aim, it might want to take a rest. The Hazel Grove action group has won and is going to raise the necessary funds for the next campaign, but it would have to return an annual

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
entry at a cost of £75 a year, or whatever cost is set. A dormant party is not an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as I thought that we were moving towards the end of our proceedings, we had the notion of phoenix parties rising. I said that I was uneasy about this matter. There have been issues that deserve further thought and reflection. I shall reflect on them. I am not
