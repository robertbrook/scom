	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Royal Parks (Trading) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Alan Howarth.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Alan Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before addressing the clause Mr. Sayeed, I welcome your chairmanship, under which I have every confidence that our proceedings will develop harmoniously and fruitfully to an expeditious conclusion. It is important that the details of the Bill, which we discussed in general principle in a Second Reading Committee should be considered carefully. I am pleased that we have moved so quickly to the Committee stage—the Bill is important and was strongly supported by all parties on Second Reading—and I hope that its progress will continue to be uncontentious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly set the context. Illegal trading in the royal parks is a nuisance. It is dirty, smelly and unhealthy and undermines the legitimate businesses sanctioned by the Secretary of State. The public must be protected from unprincipled traders, and the powers available to do so are inadequate. The Bill will provide powers of enforcement similar to those exercised by the City of Westminster, which Parliament approved in the City of Westminster Act 1999. The Bill will increase the fines that magistrates courts can levy, and introduce a power of seizure, which has been used effectively by the City of Westminster. We have equally sought to provide safeguards that protect the rights of the owner of any object seized.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows the Secretary of State, as one of the successors to the commissioners of works, to designate provisions of regulations made under section 2(1) of the Parks Regulation (Amendment) Act 1926 as park trading regulations. That designation will, in turn, be achieved by regulations made under the 1926 Act. Any failure to comply with a park trading regulation will subsequently be a park trading offence. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Brooke 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cities of London and Westminster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you, Mr. Sayeed, to the Chair. I should explain the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who I daresay has spoken privately to the Minister. He is attending a conference on tourism in the north of
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
England in his capacity as shadow Minister. In so far as any hon. Member is representing the official Opposition on this occasion, I am. During the Committee stage of the Great London Authority Bill, when I briefly represented the Opposition Front Bench on the clauses relating to the Metropolitan police, I continued to sit on the Back Bencehes to demonstrate my humility, and I shall do the same now. Given my advanced years, I would not dream of sitting on the Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a brief reference to the Second Reading debate, which I am sure the Minister will condone. During my speech on Second Reading, I uttered a single word—"procrastination"—which elicited a full column of observations from the Minister. I can only assume that there was a degree of sensitivity on the Government Front Bench. The word was descriptive and not evaluative. I have no intention of occasioning procrastination in the Committee today. I appreciate that at the court of king Campbell it is wrong for the Government to admit that anything that goes wrong is their fault. I do not mind that the Minister half-suggested that I was responsible for the delay in the Bill's introduction. I was faced with a little difficulty on Second Reading, because Mr. Winterton, who was in the Chair, is quick to suppress any Back-Bench Member who intervenes on a speech for more than a moment. It was therefore difficult for me to combat more than a column's-worth of observations by the Minister. I shall briefly describe the circumstances to which the Minister referred without, I hope, straying out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In December 1997, as the Member of Parliament for half the royal parks, I wrote to the Secretary of State. I sought to convince him that the official Opposition Front Bench would, in a bipartisan spirit, be happy to accommodate the Government in getting the Bill through. When he replied to me at the end of January, the Secretary of State said that the then Minister for Film and Tourism, the right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke), had been deputed to speak to the shadow spokesman on tourism. That conversation did not occur until July 1998. That six-month delay did not suggest that the Government were, like Blücher, hurrying towards the scene of battle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By July 1998, it was of course impossible for anything to be done during that Session. It would have been perfectly possible to introduce the procedure that has now been adopted during the 1997–98 Session, when the Government's programme was less busy than it is in the current Session, in which we are overwhelmed with business. I rested on my oars during that entire period in case the Government approached me for assistance. In November 1998, I took the chief executive of the Royal Parks agency to lunch. He has just retired, but is pleased that the Bill—which is a happy development in the history of the royal parks—is being introduced in time to mark his retirement. I put to him the suggestion that I reiterated in my brief intervention on the Minister on Second Reading. No word came back from the Government. In his speech on Second Reading, the Minister said that if my comments had been more lucid, something might have been done. Opposition Back-Bench Members are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
often told sharply when we write to Ministers on matters relating to agencies that we should have written to the relevant agency. I infer that we are now being told that, having spoken to the agency, we should have spoken to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In May 1999, another six months having passed, I was in the United States with the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. On my return, I heard that the Minister had telephoned during my absence because he had to take part in an urgent television interview on Carlton. The Lord Chief Justice had ruled out one of the devices that the royal parks police were deploying against the Albanians, and the Minister wanted confirmation that I would be happy if certain things were said about me in my absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no complaint about that, other than that I was a little surprised to receive no further approach from the Department until we reached the Whitsun recess. At that point, I was asked to appear in the Minister's office at lunchtime on Tuesday 14 June—or perhaps it was 13 June. Given that time was rapidly running out, I rang back to say that I would be perfectly happy to see the Minister on any day of the recess. However, the Minister's private office told me that he would not be available during the recess and that I would have to wait to hear what he had to say to me. The Minister pressed me to take over the Government's Bill. We had an amicable conversation during which I explained the difficulties that we would have. He was gracious enough to say that I could blame the Government in any way I wanted, which seemed to be slightly at variance with what he said on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We presented the Bill on Thursday 15 June and at half-past 2 on Friday 16 June I was responsible for moving the Second Reading. Not unreasonably, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) thought that a Bill that had been presented to the House only the previous day and which was being moved by assent at half-past 2 on a Friday could not be described as having been discussed. I went through that somewhat lengthy prolegomenon to say that I stand by my observation about procrastination. At no time when the issue was in the Government's hands did they seek, with bipartisan support, to move the matter forward until I was summoned to the Minister's office after the Whitsun recess last year. The Minister may want to say something about that narrative, but I have no desire to say anything more. I said in my speech yesterday that it would be churlish to visit the past and I did so this morning only because of the Minister's observations when winding up on Second Reading. As those who took part in the Greater London Authority Bill know, I have a preoccupation with history and it is important that some alternative aspects of history should be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I started to speak, I said that there would be no procrastination on my part. I am delighted to welcome clause 1 and, as the Minister knows, I wholly support the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not prevail on your tolerance, Mr. Sayeed, for anything like as long as the right hon. Member for Cities of London and
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Westminster (Mr. Brooke) in what he described as a lengthy prolegomenon. Some might describe it as a filibuster and I am sure that it will fill two columns of 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman demonstrated sensitivity, if not rawness of feeling, on the matter. I gently and amicably upbraided him in our previous proceedings when he referred to procrastination. He sought to persuade the Committee this morning that that was a descriptive and not an evaluative word, but it is a loaded word. Every member of the Committee will look forward enormously to publication of the right hon. Gentleman's diaries. He has probably not needed to keep a written diary because he is legendary for his feats of recall. His memory is extraordinary and, if you would allow it, Mr. Sayeed, he could probably quote pages and pages of Wisden in extenso for the entertainment and better instruction of the Committee. We are not discussing cricket this morning, but our proceedings should progress in the best spirit and tradition of that noble game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the matter on Second Reading I wanted to establish that the Government did not seek to delay the passage of the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman, with his experience of Government, knows that there is always competition for legislative time and that an incoming Government are bound to have an ambitious legislative agenda with major topics of public concern—the health service, education, social security and so on. We did our best to secure an early place for the Bill in the Government's legislative timetable, but we had to wait our turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was appointed to my present post in July 1998 and I have no knowledge of any negotiations that might have occured before then. We wanted to put the Bill on the statute book as soon as possible and when it became aparent that, unfortunately, it would not find a place in the legislative session, I contacted the right hon. Gentleman to establish what we could do to achieve the same purpose by way of a private Member's Bill. My thoughts naturally turned to him. I am not suggesting that he is the only begetter of the legislation, but he has strong claim to paternity and any DNA test would demonstrate that he was largely implicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only small criticism of the right hon. Gentleman is that the spirit of bipartisanship, which undoubtedly existed between the Government, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Deomcrats, did not prevail across the spectrum—some might say that sadly, these days, it is not a wide spectrum—to embrace all Conservative Members. The right hon. Gentleman has experience in the Whips Office and as a former chairman of the Conservative party, but his extraordinary failure to control the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst prevented us from reaching a happy denouement earlier. However, I am pleased to say that we are now moving towards such an outcome. I launch that amiable stricture at the right hon. Gentleman in a teasing spirit. He was simply in error to allege that the Government have procrastinated in this regard. The Bill did not reach the statute book last year because of squabbling and bickering in the Conservative party and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
because of an act of vandalism on the part of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, in his tribute to Mr. David Welch, who has just retired as chief executive of the Royal Parks agency. I could not agree more with the right hon. Gentleman, who suggested that we should pay an appropriate tribute, or erect a suitable monument, to Mr. Welch if the Bill is enacted. Various regulations will need to be laid subsequently, but we hope to ensure that the nuisance that we seek to correct in the royal parks will take effect this summer. I hope that Committee members will agree to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of our discussion on clause 1, and the fact that I feel suitably admonished by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), I shall be extremely brief. I hope that my comments on the clause will fill not more than six lines of a column in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that in the case of park trading offences, failure to comply with, or contravention of, regulations made under section 2(1) of the 1926 Act will involve a maximum penalty not exceeding
	<br><blockquote><p>level 3 on the standard scale</p></blockquote>
which carries a fine of £1,000. The current maximum penalty involves level 1 on the standard scale, which carries a fine of £200. Magistrates courts generally impose much lower fines but even the maximum fine of £200 is no deterrent. The courts need to have much higher penalties available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On Second Reading, the Minister referred to the fact that there has been active fracas in the royal parks between the various people engaged in this sort of trade. I remark historically that the last time that a mortality occurred as a result of a duel in the royal parks, which I think was in 1712—it was clearly an offence—both the duellists died.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable. The right hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause will give my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Royal Parks Constabulary the power to seize items that appear to have been used in the commission of a park trading offence. The scope of this power will not apply to anything of a perishable nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) requires that a park constable must reasonably suspect that a person has committed a park trading offence before the power of seizure becomes exercisable. Subsection (2) adds the rider that a constable may exercise such a power only in the park in which he has jurisdiction. If those two conditions are met, subsection (1) gives the parks constable the discretion to seize anything that the trader has in his or her possession or under his or her control, which the constable reasonably believes to have been used in the commission of a park trading offence. All members of the Royal Parks Constabulary and all members of the Metropolitan police will have the authority to enforce this power in all the royal parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not tabled an amendment to the clause, but I want to ask the Minister a probing question. The words in the Bill and the Minister's words emphasise goods of a non-perishable nature. It is reasonable for us to ask the Minister what will happen to perishable goods. Will they simply be dumped in the royal parks? The constables will be aware that their powers do not extend to perishable goods, so we can envisage that they will simply be deposited by the stall owner and left for somebody else to clear up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister could give a more graphic account of what will happen to perishable goods. Unless there is a strong reason why they have been left out of the Bill, there would seem to be a case

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
for affording the power to destroy them as a way of bringing them to an end, but there may be a legal objection to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has asked an understandable question. The Royal Parks Constabulary will follow the same procedures as City of Westminster council officials, who offer the unlicensed trader the opportunity to take the perishable goods away. Almost all traders accept that invitation, probably because the goods have a monetary value to them: traders tend to be charged for their stock by the people managing or running them. The trader is asked to sign a form acknowledging that he is either taking or refusing to take the perishables, whichever applies. If he refuses to take them, it is on the understanding that they will be destroyed by the enforcing authority to protect environmental health and the general amenity of the surroundings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his clear reply. I am embarrassed to say, as the local Member of Parliament, that I am not familiar with every word of the Westminster legislation. Is what the Minister just described in the statute, or is it simply an agreement, which is already hallowed by custom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that it is in the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RETENTION AND DISPOSAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the retention and possible disposal of items seized pursuant to clause 4. Subsection (1) allows the Secretary of State to retain anything seized pursuant to clause 4 until the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date of seizure. Subsections (2) and (3) specify the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may retain seized items beyond the 28-day period. That can happen only if proceedings for a park trading offence have been commenced against the person from whom the items were seized, in respect of his or her activities at the time of the seizure. If such proceedings have not begun within the 28-day period, the power of retention will no longer apply. If proceedings have begun within 28 days, the Secretary of State may retain the items seized until the conclusion of the proceedings, including any appeal. In the event of the court making an award of costs to be paid by the accused to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State may retain the items until those costs have been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) ensures that the powers of retention are subject to any order for forfeiture of the seized items made under clause 6. Subsection (5) provides that if the award of costs in the Secretary of State's favour is not paid in full within a further 28 days following the conclusion of court proceedings, including any appeal, the Secretary of State may sell the item at the best price
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that can be reasonably obtained, in order to pay such costs. Any balance should be paid to the former owner. Subsection (6) provides for seized items to be returned to their owner or owners if the Secretary of State ceases to be entitled to retain them, subject to any order of forfeiture made under clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) details the procedure that will be followed if the owner of seized items cannot subsequently be identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to probe the Minister on what he just said. Subsection (5) gives the Secretary of State the power to sell any seized item if it is still in police possession 28 days after the conclusion of any court proceedings. As the Minister said, the Secretary of State must pay any balance, net of costs, to the person whom he believes to be the rightful owner. Does it make sense to sell off hot dog carts if the purpose of the exercise is to stamp out illegal trading? In what the Minister and I described as my prolegomenon to the Committee stage, I alluded to being abroad with the Select Committee on Northern Ireland in May last year, when the Minister tried to reach me in relation to a Carlton television broadcast. Some bystanders might have thought that that was the trigger for the Minister's new interest in the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to reach the right hon. Gentleman to discuss how the legislation might be transacted most expeditiously in Parliament. It happened that I also had to do an interview with Carlton, and I thought that it would be a courtesy to speak to the right hon. Gentleman, to ensure that anything I might say would be acceptable to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not seeking to lure the Minister into an ambush. However, he was careless to indicate that that was his intention in May last year, as his office did not contact me until towards the end of May, which suggests that acceleration was not the principal stimulus. However, that is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the Select Committee on Northern Ireland because it conducted an inquiry last year into a similar issue—that of the sale of smuggled fuel oil across the Irish border. The vehicles in which that fuel is smuggled are sometimes conventional, but frequently not—as is the wont of Irish affairs. The most extraordinary vehicles can be reconfigured in order to carry fuel oil illegally, and the Select Committee report recommended that Customs and Excise's selling of such reconfigured vehicles back into the market at auction was not the swiftest way to bring that trade to an end. If they were taken out of the market and destroyed, any new vehicle to be used for the purpose would have to be reconfigured and could not simply be picked up ready made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the example of vehicles used in the Republic and in Northern Ireland is not an exact analogy, because they have been reconfigured to suit that trade, whereas a hot dog stand is a hot dog stand. However, it raises the question whether it makes sense to sell off hot dog carts if our purpose is to stamp out illegal trading. It could be argued that selling them at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V007P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
auction will simply perpetuate the trade that the Bill aims to prevent. I do not intend to lure the Minister into an ambush, but I must ask the Government's view about restoring to the market the very machines that we seek to ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman raises an excellent and practical point. I offer him a reassurance that I hope that he and the Committee will find satisfactory. The Northern Ireland case that he cited is not a bad analogy, and we must avoid causing the kind of sequence of events that he has drawn to our attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite the current practice of City of Westminster council in this regard, to illustrate that we do not anticipate creating a secondary market in hot dog stands. It will be within the power of the courts and of the Secretary of State to ensure that the hot dog carts and the burger barrows are destroyed. It is City of Westminster council's practice to have such barrows crushed and sold to a scrap metal dealer. It prosecuted about 3,000 illegal traders in 1999, and in about 700 cases it seized barrows, of which about 70 per cent.—about 500—were burger barrows. In 95 per cent. of those cases, the court awarded forfeiture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In almost all the cases, the council was unable to ascertain the identity of the barrows' owners. It always asks, when a barrow is seized, but the traders will not give the owner's name. That being so, Westminster has the barrows crushed and sells them to a scrap metal dealer. The practice of putting them up for auction does not occur. We shall have the power, and the will, to ensure that that does not occur in circumstances arising from the seizure or forfeiture of barrows in the royal parks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful explanation. In the spirit in which the Committee is conducting its affairs, I can assure you, Mr. Sayeed, the Minister and the hon. Member for Richmond Park, that I have no further observations to make on the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the issue of forfeiture and will apply when a person has been convicted of a park trading offence.

	<ol>

	<li>is retained by the Secretary of State under section 5, and</li>
	<li>the court believes to have been used in the commission of the offence.</li></ol>
Subsection (3)(a) will require that

	<br><blockquote><p>(a) permit anyone who claims to be its owner or to have an interest in it to make representations.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
