INSPECTIONS BY PERSONS AUTHORISED BY REGISTRATION AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 218, in page 15, line 41, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'who is present at the premises during the inspection;
<br><blockquote><p>() interview in private by arrangement with the manager or person carrying on the establishment or agency during normal working hours any person employed there who is not present at the premises during the inspection;'.—[<i>Mr. Hammond.</i>]</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'> I shall not have the Floor for very much longer, Mr. Gale.<br><br>
The debate was extensive. I hope that my explanation of our concerns and reservations will allow the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall withdraw the amendment in a moment. Surprising as it may be to Labour Members, the amendment was not meant to be provocative, but—interestingly—it flushed out some important issues.<br><br>
I assumed that an inspector would interview an employee during work time at the place of employment. However, the Minister said that inspectors would have the power to examine records at the place of employment, to get the home address of an employee and to knock on the door of his place of residence, all of which could take place in the middle of the night. The employee would not have to let him in, but he would have to be careful about the offence of intentionally obstructing the exercise of any power in clause 29. I am slightly alarmed by that prospect. The Minister would not want the Committee to have the impression that the practice will be widely used to interview employees. I am sure that he intends inspectors to follow the normal route of finding an employee at the place of work. The amendment was tabled with that in mind.<br><br>
I shall go away and think about whether employees—as opposed to registered persons or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
managers of establishments—should be required to participate in the process and be interviewed in their homes. No one is suggesting that an employee who contacts the commission as a whistleblower should not have the opportunity to talk to inspectors at a place of his choosing, but we would not want that provision to be onerous to ordinary employees who are not whistleblowers or suspected of doing anything wrong. People whom inspectors interview about procedures and what has gone on in a home should not be adversely affected by the measure.<br><br>
Inspectors might arrive at 3 o'clock—let us not be dramatic and say in the morning—on a Wednesday afternoon at a remotely located care home in a rural part of the country, where they talk to employees, examine the records and decide to speak to two or three other employees who will not be on duty until the following day. Instead of getting into their cars and going back to the city whence they came, it would be simpler and more convenient to go to an employee's house, knock on the door and say, "Would you mind if we had a chat with you now?" I am not sure how the clause is expected to work. It is implicit that the interview will occur in private—let us remember that the Government inserted the term "in private" only at the suggestion of our noble Friends in the House of Lords—and that it will occur at the workplace. I shall think about how to pursue our line of inquiry at a later stage, but for now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 15, line 43, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'who, in the reasonable opinion of the person authorised under subsection (2), is capable of giving such consent'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would deal with consent by changing the wording of subsection (3)(e), which states that inspectors
<br><blockquote><p>may interview in private any patient or person accommodated or cared for … who consents to be interviewed.</p></blockquote>
The Committee might be tempted to think that it is implicit that the person must be capable of giving consent, as the amendment states. However, lines 12 and 13 of page 16 state that the power to examine a person in private
<br><blockquote><p>may be exercised in relation to a person who is incapable of giving consent without that person's consent.</p></blockquote>
It is not self evident that the person in question has to be capable of giving consent, and it is not appropriate for people who are incapable of giving consent to be deemed to have done so unless there are much more rigorous procedures to protect them. After all, the Bill is designed to stop abuse and to protect vulnerable people. Probably the most vulnerable people of whom any of us can conceive are those who are incapable of giving consent or who are deemed to be incapable of doing so. The Committee must consider carefully whether better safeguards are necessary to ensure that the people who are interviewed by the inspectors have genuinely given their consent and were capable of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
properly doing so. Furthermore, is the provision comfortable with lines 12 and 13 of page 16, which allow an inspector, who will be a medical practitioner or nurse, to examine people without their consent when he or she deems them to be incapable of giving it?<br><br>
The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill's purpose. The consent provision seems out of place in a Bill that is designed to improve protection of the most vulnerable people, but which exposes them to what could be intrusive interviewing or medical examination. The Bill does not allow that to occur without consent, but it can occur when consent cannot reasonably be deemed to be given. Legal procedures, in the mental health Acts and elsewhere specify the way in which circumstances where people are not capable of giving their consent should be dealt with. Those provisions are always and without exception designed to ensure a check; that a proper procedure is followed that will avoid risk of abuse, which could arise if the person concerned cannot properly give their consent when it might be easy to procure nominal consent from someone who is not capable of giving it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman's amendment make matters worse? The amendment would offer a let out to a person who carried out an examination without consent—an act that might constitute assault. Such a person could claim reasonably to have believed that there had been consent. There could not be consent per se without the amendment and so the assault could not be said to have occurred. The amendment would let off the hook someone of bad faith who might wish to undertake such an action.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might be getting himself a little confused. The amendment relates specifically to subsection (3)(e), which concerns the right to interview in private a patient or person accommodated. I have referred to the provisions under subsection (6), which allow a medically qualified inspector or an inspector who is a registered nurse to carry out a medical examination of a patient. The hon. Gentleman's points perhaps refer more to that specific category of case. The amendment's intention is not to loosen but to tighten the controls.<br><br>
I recognise that amendment No. 219 addresses only part of the problem; I have outlined the difficulty in relation to subsection (6). We attempted to draft an amendment to subsection (6) but have not tabled one simply because the area was so complicated. I felt that the way to proceed would be to flag up the problem for the Minister by means of amendment No. 219. The Government's thoughts on the matter and whether it would be more appropriate in the context to consider methods used in other areas of our law to protect people otherwise incapable of giving their consent could then be known. If the Minister were sympathetic to the argument, we could leave him to study with his officials whether there was a need to tighten the definition of giving consent and the way of dealing with people incapable of consent in relation to both subsections (3)(e) and (6). I hope that the Minister will treat the amendment in the light of those comments and take the opportunity to consider those points.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand <span class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am no further enlightened following the speech of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge than I was when I first read the amendment. That is no doubt my failing rather than his. I am not sure of the motivation behind the amendment. I hoped that the code of practice for inspectors would have included a provision on not causing distress to those on whose behalf they were carrying out their task. It would be reasonable to interview a patient or resident who might not be able to act for themselves or give consent within the legal definition. It would also be important for such people to have an opportunity to discuss even their unstructured fears. The evidence that such an interview might produce must be weighted against the person giving the information.<br><br>
I have difficulty with the amendment because, in residential homes, no formal classification is made of people's fitness to make such a judgment. Many people who are placed in residential homes have never undergone a process of assessment or certification. They live in a home and therefore have rights to be interviewed or not to be interviewed as they wish. I do not believe that it would be helpful to include a competence specification in the Bill.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
While we are debating clause 29, I want to ask the Minister about subsection (3)(b), which relates to medical records. I accept that one would not want a registration unit to carry out a general trawl, but I can also envisage circumstances in which it would be essential for someone, such as a director of public health, to have access to medical records to see whether there are patterns of inappropriate prescribing or occurrences of death in a particular establishment. It is important that some mechanism should be available to the registration unit to enable it to examine medical records, as well as to have an opportunity, provided for in subsection (5), to carry out a clinical examination and inspect the medical records of individuals, with or without their consent. With those remarks, I look forward, as usual, to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I should say that I am prepared to be reasonably flexible, but hon. Members should not look too hard for a stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale, and welcome back to our proceedings.<br><br>
I understand perfectly the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in his amendment. However, I am not sure that I understood what difference the amendment would make because, from my reading of it, the onus would remain with the authorised person, under subsection (2), to judge whether a person did or did not have consent. However, that is implicit in the wording of the subsection. The argument that the wording of subsection (6) means that it is not implicit is inaccurate because the wording of lines 12 and 13 relates specifically to the person identified in subsection (5)(b), which refers to,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 391</span>
<br><blockquote><p>a medical practitioner or … nurse … has reasonable cause to believe that a patient or person accommodated or cared for there is not receiving proper care.</p></blockquote>
Given the point made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), and given that the issue is the appropriate care of a person, it is right to include the wording of lines 12 and 13 in the Bill. That wording will ensure that the patient's welfare can be preserved in difficult circumstances.<br><br>
The wider point about consent to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge alluded is hugely complicated, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would be first to acknowledge—as would the hon. Member for Isle of Wight as a result of his experience as a practitioner. We are not unaware of those problems. We are currently developing a project with the British Institute of Learning Disabilities to develop new training materials for inspectors to improve their skills in working with service users in that especially difficult area where issues of consent are frequent problems. Therefore, although I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point, I am not persuaded that the amendment would take us any further forward. However, I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall reconsider the matter in the next few days to see whether we have got it right—my feeling at this stage is that we have—and to advise the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say—I think I did say—that I was not expecting the Minister to accept the amendment. I recognise that it is imperfect and that it addresses only half the problem. However, I want to know in what circumstances it would be appropriate for someone unable to give consent to be interviewed without a third party being able to act in his best interests, who may also be involved in deciding whether he should be deemed to have given consent. Likewise, in certain circumstances, a third party should be involved in deciding whether a person incapable of giving consent could be deemed to have given consent to a medical examination.<br><br>
I do not claim to be an expert on the operation of mental health Acts. Most of those who claim to be experts are probably not telling the whole truth. Those Acts make provision for dealing with people who are incompetent and who cannot make decisions for themselves, and those procedures involve more than one person reviewing the situation. The provisions of subsection (6) struck me as odd because no third party is involved; only the resident or patient, who is incapable of giving consent, and the inspector, who is a nurse or someone medically qualified, are mentioned. That other person alone has the power to make the decision, which is wrong.<br><br>
In his response, the Minister displayed a clear understanding of and sensitivity to the issue. I am confident that he will go away and think about whether anything can be done that would improve this part of the Bill. Nothing can ever make it perfect because, by definition, dealing with people who cannot give consent is always fraught with difficulty. However, I am satisfied that the Minister is aware of the problem. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 71, in page 15, line 46, after "any" insert "documents or".—[<i>Mr. Hutton.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 222, in page 16, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to the persons or types of person who may be authorised by the registration authority under this section including provisions as to qualifications of such persons.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would insert a provision allowing the Secretary of State to make provision by regulation on the persons or type of person to be authorised by the registration authority, including their qualifications. Training, the quality of inspectors and the conduct of inspections will be central to the smooth working of this part of the Bill. The subject was debated in the other place. My noble Friend Earl Howe said that
<br><blockquote><p>one of the most important tests of the credibility of the national care standards commission will be the conduct of inspections.—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 March 2000; Vol. 611, c. 793.]</p></blockquote>
In reply, Lord Hunt acknowledged the importance of training, of the inspectorate having a proper skill base and a proper guidance on the conduct of inspections.<br><br>
I do not want to labour the point, but we must consider the matter against the backdrop of what happens now. We do not have a level playing field. Inspectors are employed by local authorities or health authorities and inspect only private, independent establishments, not local authority-run establishments. In some parts of the country, for all sorts of reasons that are now shrouded in the mists of time, serious animosities have built up between inspectorates, or individual inspectors, and those who operate and manage independent care or nursing home facilities.<br><br>
Some of that tension has come about because of the conflict of interest caused by local authorities being required to inspect and approve private facilities that are in competition with those provided by the local authority. It inevitably creates tension if the local authority facility is not wonderful and is operating at only 60 per cent. capacity. It is understandable that local authority inspectors working in the same social services department that provides local authority care should lack sympathy with privately operated care homes that offer more attractive facilities and that compete with the local authority services.<br><br>
It is precisely because the Government recognise that tension, and realise that it is not healthy to have local authorities—or anyone else for that matter—acting as both inspector and competitor, that they seek to level that playing field through the Bill by proposing a single inspectorate to inspect local-authority provided and private-sector homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steve McCabe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the sentiment that the hon. Gentleman is expressing. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one recognised post-qualification inspection award, which is invariably held by people who work in local authority inspection units. The danger, if the amendment were to be accepted, is that the hon. Gentleman would further cement the very thing that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0223">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
does not want. It is unlikely that those with experience in the other elements of the sector would already hold that qualification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The intention was not to suggest that a qualification should be a pre-requisite. In fact, Mr. Gale, I should explain my intention.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to probe the Minister a little further on exactly who he expects to carry out the inspection. Who will be the inspectors? He will know, because he talks to representative bodies, that the fear is of a wholesale transfer of inspection staff from local authorities and health authorities to the National Care Standards Commission. The same people would be in new and probably more expensive offices, probably earning slightly higher salaries and wearing shiny new hats, perhaps with a new logo, and would be carrying out precisely the same job.<br><br>
In my notes, I have written the words "fresh start". The Bill seems to have the positive intention of putting behind us some of the inevitable tensions of the present system, of creating a level playing field and of trying to ensure that it works. Two or three little clouds can be seen over that idealised scenario, one of which is the possibility that the same people who, in some parts of the country, have problems in their relationships with the people being inspected, will continue their inspections but will wear different hats. Some of the independent sector providers will believe that nothing has changed. They will think that the same people, with the same baggage and perhaps the same prejudices, will be doing the same jobs.<br><br>
The point of the amendment was to let the Minister say something about the inspectors. Who will they be? What types of people will they be? What qualifications and experience will they have? What mix of backgrounds does the Minister envisage them having? What can he say to calm people's fear that the Bill's later provisions on transfer of employment would mean the wholesale transfer of existing inspectorates into the National Care Standards Commission? Will he confirm that the commission will not be directed to take on inspectors who are currently employed with local authorities and health authorities?<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
There are clear powers in a schedule to the Health Act 1999 for the Secretary of State to direct primary care trusts to take on employees of health authorities, for reasons that everybody understood. It is the Minister's intention that there should be a fresh start for the new inspectorate, with recruitment from a variety of different backgrounds and an opportunity to put the past behind us? Or will the inspectorate, in reality, be the same people wearing different hats? I shall wait to hear what he has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with Earl Howe's comments on the importance of these issues. There is no question but that the interface between establishments and agencies and the new National Care Standards Commission will be of the utmost importance. The relationship between all care providers—those currently in the public sector
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
as well as those in the private, independent or voluntary sector—and the commission needs to be based on professional respect and competence. There is little disagreement between us about the importance of that.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would add a new regulatory power. I do not want to re-rehearse all the arguments of earlier sittings, but as I have said before, such regulation-making powers are not necessary to achieve the effect that the hon. Gentleman seeks. In general, we hope that the registration authority will be able to decide on the suitability of particular people or types of people to carry out inspections.<br><br>
Once appointed, the commission should be left to get on with its work with as little interference as possible from the Government. These issues relate fundamentally to the competence and ability of an employer to recruit staff properly and effectively. If there were genuine concerns over the type of person appointed as inspectors, the Secretary of State could issue directions to the commission—and he or she would do so. The hon. Gentleman will see in paragraph (12) of schedule 1 the power to give directions on the appointment of staff. That could include directions on the qualifications of inspectors if necessary. I am sure that the Bill contains all the necessary and appropriate powers to intervene in the areas identified by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also spoke of concerns among care home providers about existing inspection arrangements. He might have over-exaggerated, but he made a reasonable point. We are all aware that there are some concerns. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to characterise the relationship between providers, local authorities and health authorities and inspection units by the sort of mistrust and concern that he identified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To make what I said crystal clear, I readily acknowledge that in many areas relationships are good and work well, but in some areas, for historical reasons, there is animosity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to accept that; I think that, in turn, the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that, almost by its nature, there is bound to be tension between the role of inspectors with a regulatory function—whether that is a domiciliary care agency or other agency—and an establishment such as a care home or nursing home. There are bound to examples of tension between the two. That is a reality that we cannot pretend away.<br><br>
In future, we would like to work with the Training Organisation for the Personal Social Services to develop new clear occupational standards for inspectors. They will be needed to underpin the development of the new qualification for inspectors. The hon. Gentleman will be aware, however, because it is clear from the Bill, that all staff who want to transfer to the National Care Standards Commission will be able to do so. That is precisely what is provided for by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations. They will be given induction and on-going training by the commission, which is entirely right and proper.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
I have no doubt that new people will come into the profession—and we should see it as such—in future. They will have new skills and a different perspective. There will be many opportunities for the care standards commission to use innovative and exciting ways to develop the role and competence of its inspection staff. It may be possible to arrange secondments from the providers into the care standards commission, and vice versa. Such new ways of working will add to the value of the inspection and registration arrangement for which we are legislating.<br><br>
Of course there will be change—there is no doubt about that. We want to develop new training qualifications for National Care Standards Commission inspectors. As we have made clear previously, we particularly want the commission to explore the opportunity of using lay inspectors as part of the process, and we hope that older people will have a valuable contribution to make, especially in residential care homes and nursing homes.<br><br>
The future is not as bleak as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge portrayed it. Somehow he gave the impression of a bunch of neo-Nazis, whom everyone hates, being frog-marched into a new organisation, kitted out with new uniforms and sent out to do the same hideous job that they were doing before. [<i>Interruption.</i>] That might be a caricature of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but as they say, I have the Floor and I might be able to get away with it. The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong. I am sure that he will do so in a few seconds.<br><br>
There is an opportunity to establish a new relationship between providers and the care standards commission based on the fundamental qualities of professional respect and competence that we want to be the hallmarks of the new commission. We accept that we need to move on from some of the difficult relationships of the past, and that is what we are talking about, but the scope of the transfer is clear from the operation of the TUPE regulations. People who are currently doing the work will have the opportunity, if they wish, to transfer to the National Care Standards Commission.<br><br>
For the other reasons that I have given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will in part be reassured particularly about the development of new qualifications, the opportunity for new people to work with the National Care Standards Commission and exciting possibilities, such as secondments, in the future. We are trying to turn a new page. There is general consensus that we need to do so, for many of the reasons that he, others and many of my hon. Friends have given in Committee. The future is positive and I hope that none of the existing concerns and fears will be unnecessarily carried over. We have the opportunity to make significant progress in all these areas and we intend to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, and so as not to disappoint the Minister, I do not recall referring to anyone as a neo-Nazi. Whatever the thoughts that go through my mind, I try to filter them before they reach my mouth, but I can honestly say that that one never even entered my consciousness.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the phrase that springs to mind from the description of the inspection regulation unit is more that of Torquemada leading the Spanish Inquisition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The record will show that it is the Minister who has used the terms neo-Nazi, Stasi and jackboot. I do not recall using any of those terms myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly own up to using the expressions Stasi and neo-Nazi, but I certainly never used the word "jackboot".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that insight into the limits that the Minister sets himself. Stasi and neo-Nazi are acceptable terms of abuse, but apparently jackboot is not. We are perhaps not helping ourselves by using such exaggerated terms, because the care inspectorate is not to be a uniformed army. The vast majority will have good working relationships with the people they currently inspect and those whom they will inspect in future. The Minister has talked about the TUPE regulations. I must confess that I had thought of this whole exercise less as the transfer of an undertaking and more as the creation of a brand new, fresh mechanism for inspecting not only the private and independent sector but local authority provision. It is a little disappointing to view the exercise as the transfer of an existing undertaking.<br><br>
The Minister said that tension was inevitable. I fully accept that tension between care providers and the people who inspect them is not only inevitable but is healthy. There needs to be a little tension between those doing the regulating and inspection and those providing the service. If there is not, and the relationship gets too cosy, something is wrong. However, the historical tension that we are concerned with does not arise simply from that relationship of inspector and inspected. It arises from the complex relationship of the inspector who is also closely associated with a competitive provider. The Government have recognised that that is an avoidable tension. It is precisely to avoid that unnecessary complication that the Government have created a level playing field in the Bill, which provides that local authority and independent provision will be inspected on a similar basis. However, if that inspection is to be done by the existing staff wearing different hats, the Government run a very real risk of undermining what they have set out to achieve in creating this level playing field.<br><br>
We will have the problem of inspectors inspecting private sector providers with whom they have had long and, in a small but significant number of cases, acrimonious or hostile relationships. Those same inspectors will also be asked to inspect their former colleagues in local authority social services departments who provide care through local authority provision. I imagine that they will have instinctive sympathy with the difficulties experienced by people working in the local authority sector to provide direct local authority care provision. They will know of the problems and internal difficulties and pressures that those people are under.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
There are two risks. One is that that may lead to a non-even-handed approach in regulating and inspecting the two sectors. There is perhaps an even greater risk that it will be perceived to lead to that outcome by the independent care sector providers. The same inspectors from whom they may have felt hostility in the past will inspect them, and those same inspectors—former employees of the local authority—will inspect the local authority care homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hilton Dawson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster and Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In previous debates, the hon. Gentleman has averred that we live on separate planets. He has just given a good example of that. I have had direct experience of managing establishments that were inspected by people who were ex-employees of the social services department and whom I had previously managed. I assure him that those poachers turned gamekeepers were assiduous in their inspection duties and used their knowledge of the sector to drive up standards considerably. There is another side, therefore, to what he is saying.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman accept the similar point—that bad home owners can have recourse to the questioning and undermining of the professional competence of the people called on to inspect them?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I readily acknowledge that in—I hope—the large majority of cases, relationships will be smooth. However, the hon. Gentleman ought to talk to private sector providers if he thinks that these are not very real conerns in the independent sector. He did have the opportunity to talk to the Lancashire Care Home Association last night. As I said, it is not only the reality of the potential problem but the perception of it that runs the risk of undermining the very achievement that the Government are seeking, of levelling the playing field and getting away from some of the past complications where inspectors were seen as being too closely associated with a competitive provider.<br><br>
When we discuss the relationship between inspectors and the inspected, we are discussing people. Changing the name of the institution does not change relationships. It will take a lot more than a couple of ministerial directions to change the ethos that prevails among inspectors in areas where there have been problems in the past. The problem does not affect every area but it is more prevalent in some geographical locations than in others—perhaps because of personality issues or because, historically, there have been tensions between local authority and independent sector provision.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the Minister say that the registration authority needed to be left to decide for itself. Once it has been set up and given its remit, it should decide for itself. To do otherwise would be to question the competence of the registration authority, and it should be left to operate with as little interference as possible. I was pleased to hear that, but I am surprised that the Minister has not thought through the wider applicability of that concept across the national health service. Health authorities and trust governing bodies are routinely set up but are not left to decide for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
themselves how to put things into practice and how to carry them out with as little interference as possible from the Secretary of State—quite the opposite is happening. Does the Minister think that the interference that they regularly suffer from the Secretary of State calls into question their competence?<br><br>
I do not expect the Minister to accept my amendment, but I am a little disappointed by what I have heard. The amendment has served its purpose. The Minister has made it quite clear that he envisages that a significant number—perhaps the large majority—of inspectors will move across to the National Care Standards Commission. I have, therefore, obtained from him the information that I was seeking. I will have to consult about what that means and to what conclusions it will lead us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 221, in page 16, line 19, after "section", insert "or section 30".<br><br>
This simple amendment would extend the requirement to produce identification that is already included under clauses 29 and 30. It is not clear whether an inspector must have exercised his power of entry under clause 29, and thus have been subject to the requirement to produce identification, to make a seizure under clause 30. Under the amendment, an inspector who was contemplating exercising his powers under clause 29 or 30 would have to produce identification if required to do so.<br><br>
If the Minister can give us a cast-iron assurance that there is no circumstance in which a person could exercise his authority under clause 30 without already having had to exercise his authority under clause 29, thus making him subject to the requirement under subsection (8) to produce some duly authenticated document, I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. It is clear that no power in clause 30 can be exercised without also using the power set out in clause 29. It is clear from clause 29(8) that if an inspector is to use his powers under clause 29, he must produce a document of authentication in all those circumstances.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is in any doubt that clause 30 works in that way, he should read the heading of the clause—"Inspections: supplementary". If he looks carefully at subsections (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), he will see that they all refer to clause 29. It is our intention that the supplementary powers should be used only in the context of the powers set out in clause 29; the amendment is therefore unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He has answered the question and the amendment is clearly redundant. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

INSPECTIONS: SUPPLEMENTARY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 16, line 40, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"except that any measurements or photographs or recordings of a patient or person accommodated or cared for in an establishment may only be taken or made in accordance with the requirements of section 29(5) and (6)".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 224, in page 17, line 8, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() No report prepared in accordance with subsection (5) shall contain any material capable of identifying any individual patient, client, or person cared for or accommodated.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments deal with different matters: I shall treat each one separately.<br><br>
Amendment No. 223 seeks to qualify the power granted to an inspector under clause 30(2)(b). The subsection states that an inspector
<br><blockquote><p>May take such measurements and photographs and make such recordings as he considers necessary to enable him to exercise his powers.</p></blockquote>
I have interpreted that to mean that the measurements, photographs and recordings will be taken in relation to the premises, the environment and other inanimate matters. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe that it was—or should have been—the intention of the draftsman to allow the taking of photographs of patients or residents, for example, to record a medical condition or the treatment that had been given. Powers to deal with medical inspection—I include photographing people or taking measurements of them, including their weight, to record weight loss or gain—are covered by subsections (5) and (6) of clause 29, which provide specific safeguards regarding medically intrusive inspections, where the inspector is required to be a qualified nurse or a medical practitioner. It may be an inadvertent consequence of the wording of subsection (2)(b) but I can see nothing to prevent an inspector from taking photographs or measurements of an individual. The amendment would make the inappropriateness of that explicit.<br><br>
There are two possibilities. The Minister may tell us that it is intended that such photographs and recordings can be taken, in which case I shall be alarmed, or he may say that he has another means of making the matter clear in the Bill. The amendment is intended to probe the Government's intentions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised by the way in which the hon. Gentleman has moved his amendment, because his description of it does not appear that way on the amendment paper. Under the amendment, would it be impossible for someone authorised to enter premises under clause 29 to take a photograph of a resident who might show signs of having been abused?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to alarm the Minister. I am not suggesting that such actions should not be taken, but the powers under clause 29(5) and (6) are specifically drafted to deal with cases in which a patient has to be examined. The Bill requires that to be done by a nurse or a doctor, which is right.<br><br>
Let us consider a case in which a patient has bruises on his body and there is suspicion of abuse. In those circumstances, it is reasonable that an inspector qualified by virtue of clause 29(5) and (6) might want to take photographs. Another patient might be malnourished and it would be appropriate to record his weight over a period of time, but that should be done under the provisions of clause 29(5) and (6) and not under the general provision to take measurements and photographs. I understood that that related more to the physical environment and condition of the establishment. I can think of many circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a non-medically qualified inspector to take photographs and measurements, but I would not expect such an inspector to take photographs or measurements of an individual.<br><br>
Clearly, in drafting my amendment, I did not envisage the general shot of the dayroom that catches a couple of residents sitting in their chairs. It is about medical photography—close-up photographs or measurements of the body or limbs of an individual, which everyone would think of as being properly done by a doctor or nurse. The amendment may be imperfectly drafted, but I am attempting to draw the Minister's attention to a possible loophole in the interpretation of the powers under subsection (2)(b). I seek his clarification on that matter.<br><br>
Amendment No. 224 would achieve something different. It would insert a requirement that the report prepared by inspectors following an inspection shall not identify any individual person who is a patient at or resident in the establishment. That mirrors a debate on the Health Bill last year about the privacy of individual patients' records. People can be identified as a, b, c, d, x or y, but it is inappropriate for individual residents to be identified or identifiable in the reports. The purpose of the report is to describe conditions and practices in the establishment. It is unnecessary and intrusive for a report to include any material that enables a reader to identify an individual person.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate the motives behind these amendments and certainly I support the need to protect individual patients or residents as set out in amendment No. 224. I would like further clarification on amendment No. 223. I would accept that a photograph by itself is of little value unless it is of the patient or unless someone who can interpret that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0227">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
photograph at a later stage has also seen the body. I appreciate that it would be helpful if somebody were qualified under clause 29(5) and (6) to evaluate any injury that may have occurred, or the physical state of a patient, but they may not necessarily be competent to take photographs. I would be slightly alarmed, therefore, if there were a requirement on medical photography to be carried out by a medical or nursing person. Photographs can be extremely helpful but also can be extremely misleading. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is quite a difficult job to get such photographs right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the technical point that the hon. Gentleman is making but, of course, it is unlikely that a qualified medical photographer would be an authorised person under the provision. He makes a valid point, but one that relates to something else, the possible need to remove the person in question to a hospital or appropriate place to have a detailed medical examination undertaken. I am sure that that is possible within the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. I was going slightly further by saying that no photographs of a clinical condition should be used in evidence by the inspection regime unless there was someone with suitable experience and knowledge available to interpret that photograph.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should start by saying that I share strongly the concern of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that led him to table amendment No. 224. We will certainly make sure that individual inspection reports do not name individuals who are receiving services from registered providers and it was never our intention that they would do so. If necessary, we will not hesitate to use our powers of direction to make sure that that is avoided.<br><br>
I understand the concern of the hon. Gentleman with regard to amendment No. 223. Both he and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight raised a question that I think would be largely dealt with under the laws of evidence as to what weight should be given to particular recordings, photographs or measurements that have been produced as evidence of a breach of the regulations, or some other offence. It is there that those issues would be addressed rather than in the Bill. They would be subject to the normal rules in that respect.<br><br>
On all of these matters, we are riding a difficult horse and I accept that it is sometimes a difficult ride. At the same time as we protect the natural interests and rights of residents of care homes, we want to make sure that we give the commission's inspectors, who will be doing this job on our behalf, the effective tools to do that job properly.<br><br>
It is certainly the case that, in most normal circumstances, we would expect the sort of recordings, measurements and photographs that are referred to in subsection (20)(b) to be undertaken by people within the terms of clause 29(5) and (6). That would be the normal situation. Sometimes, however, inspectors might be confronted with abnormal circumstances. If, for example, a resident is showing signs of one or even two black eyes, it may be appropriate for an inspector to take a photograph of that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would not help to serve the public interest in the way that he and I would want. We have to look at clause 30(2)(b) in its fuller sense because it is about not just taking photographs and measurements, but recordings. That might, of course, include a tape recorder. It might be appropriate in those circumstances, given that an inspector might be dealing with perhaps an extreme—hopefully very rare—example of possible abuse of a resident, to be able to take that kind of recording of what he or she has seen and to record the views of the resident, too. We must draw a line about what we think is necessarily in the public interest. The public interest that we are trying to serve is that of protecting residents in care homes from potential abuse. There are other evils that we would want to address, too.<br><br>
In constructing the Bill, therefore, we would not want unreasonably to place restrictions on the ability of an inspector to take a recording, a photograph or a measurement of something that was really, in its nature, extreme—but that would require immediate action and immediate measures to be taken. I suspect the difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's amendment would be that it would impede the ability of the National Care Standards Commission properly to take action when one of its inspectors found evidence that there was something seriously wrong going on within a care home.<br><br>
I fully understand the point of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. He is trying to get some assurance from me about who would be making these types of measurements under subsection (2)(b) in the normal run of events. I have tried to give him the assurance that normally we would expect that to be done within the context of clause 29(5) and (6). However, for the reasons I have outlined, I think it would be a mistake to make that an absolute requirement in the Bill because it would impede what I regard as being the primary function here, which is to preserve and protect the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly grateful to the Minister for what he said about amendment No. 224 and that reassures me. The purpose of the amendment was to elicit from him such an assurance. The method by which he chooses to do that is, of course, something that we do not have to discuss now, so long as he will make sure that individual details are not published.<br><br>
In relation to amendment No. 223, the Minister has indicated that, in the normal course of events, he would not expect subsection (2)(b) to be used as a way of circumventing the intentions of clause 29(5) and (6). I do accept that, in extreme circumstances, it may be necessary for people to take an immediate snapshot—literally—of a situation that presents itself to them. However, I hope that he will think about how guidance or other directions that are given to inspectors might be phrased to make it clear that there should never be an intention to take any personal or quasi-medical photographs or recordings using the powers under subsection (2) rather than the powers under clause 29(5) and (6). Rather, they should be used in extremis, where unexpectedly a situation presents itself, to avoid a recording being made at the appropriate time.<br><br>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 225, in page 16, line 40, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() A person so authorised who seizes or removes any document or other material or thing in accordance with subsection (1) shall issue a receipt in respect of any items seized and removed.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to improve on provisions within the Bill and to increase the transparency of the process of inspection. It takes as precedent one of the good practices in the procedure of the Food Standards Act 1999, which is that where a document or any other material is removed from the establishment or agency being inspected, a receipt should be issued in respect of that item. It is important that there should be a written record of documents or materials removed from the establishment or agency because there is good historical evidence of a great deal of paperwork going missing. For example, on reading the Waterhouse report, it was clear that, on a number of occasions documents that should have been there had mysteriously disappeared. It would in future be good practice for receipts to be issued in return for documents removed. There would then be no question of the inspectors being in any way involved with removing what, as the explanatory notes made clear, might be evidence in the event of a complaint about failure to comply with regulations.<br><br>
The Minister said earlier that failure to comply with regulations is a serious offence. That was how he justified the level of fines that would be imposed should an establishment or agency be found to be lacking in compliance with the regulations or the conditions of registration. Again, from the explanatory notes, I notice that conviction in some cases might be thought so serious as to warrant imprisonment. The evidence that is secured from the establishment or agency plays an important role in upholding a complaint and deciding who is guilty of failure to comply with regulations. When documents, materials or any object is removed during the course of an inspection, receipts should be issued. That is a matter of good practice and there are precedents. I hope that the Minister will be receptive to this small, but significant amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly agree that a receipt should always be provided in these circumstances. However, our preferred way is to deal with it, if necessary, by direction. If it were included in the Bill, there could be problems. The amendment does not spell out the consequences of failing to provide a receipt and that would have to be covered. Nevertheless, the Government accept the point that she has made and we will make sure that receipts are provided routinely, as a matter of good practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says. I am reassured to hear that that will be included in the guidance. Logically, the guidance will make it clear what happens if the inspectors fail to issue a receipt or in the event of other failures on the part of inspectors. We shall have to trust that this will be covered so that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
equal responsibility is felt on the part of the inspectors for carrying out all the correct practices—not simply the issuing of receipts—consistently and thoroughly. I am glad that the Minister has taken this important matter seriously. I will take his word that it will be dealt with in guidance to be issued in due course and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to clause 31. Clause 32 deals with regulations that prescribe what happens on the appointment of liquidators, receivers and so on. In relation to earlier provisions of the Bill that allow regulations to be made about the financial standing of an establishment, agency or person who seeks to be registered in respect of an establishment or agency, will the Minister clarify that being in receivership will not be a reason for disqualification? Will the regulations make it clear that it is possible and acceptable for a business to operate in receivership? The way clause 32 is drafted envisages the operation of a business by a receiver, receiver manager or Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 receiver.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister will be aware—not least because I have written to him on the subject—that there is a significant number of care home providers currently operating in receivership or with some form of receiver manager appointed. That is partly a reflection of the state of the industry. It is also an inevitable consequence of the fact that care homes in particular are property based and those sorts of businesses tend to be vulnerable to the appointment of receivers, who then seek to carry them on while sorting out the affairs. Many people lend money to care home or nursing home businesses on the assumption that they will be in a position to appoint a receiver who could carry on running them and generating revenues if they default on their loans. It would be of great reassurance to those lending money to businesses if the Minister would take this opportunity to confirm that being in receivership would not debar a person from being registered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.</span></p>

PROVISION OF COPIES OF REGISTERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 226, in page 18, leave out lines 16 to 18.<br><br>
Amendment No. 226 is a probing amendment, designed to leave out subsection (3) of the clause. Subsections (1) and (2) make uncontroversial provision for the obligation of the registration authority to allow inspection of the registers and to make copies or extracts available. Subsection (3) unnecessarily and perhaps with a touch of the Stasi mentality about it—to use the Minister's favourite expression—seeks to allow regulations to prescribe circumstances in which people would not be allowed to see the register, copies would not be allowed to be made and extracts could not be obtained. On the face of it, I see no reason for that. In the spirit of open government and freedom of information, it is appropriate that the registers are open for inspection and copying. I have tabled the amendment to see if the Minister will clarify the circumstances in which he believes that the power would be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we fully intend to make information about the services registered available ordinarily and as widely as possible. He asked me specifically about the need for clause 34(3). We have to be careful, particularly in relation to registered children's homes, that information is only provided to people who have a bona fide or legitimate need to know about the services. Our concern, to put it in a nutshell, is that we do not inadvertently make information on the whereabouts of children's homes and the ages of children accommodated in them available to paedophiles who, as all hon. Members will be aware, pose an obvious danger to children. It is our intention to use that power in such circumstances. We are not trying to drive a coach and horses through the general obligation to make information as widely available as possible, but we must exercise caution because of all we know about the activities of these evil criminals and the need to protect children properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a cogent argument. Will he assure us that the agency will publicise when it does not release information and why? It will be useful to monitor in what circumstances the regulatory powers are used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be obvious when we exercise the regulatory-making functions in clause 34(3). They will set out the circumstances in which elements of the power will be prescribed. Hon. Members will have an opportunity to discuss that. The issues might be addressed also in the National Care Standards Commission's annual report. I do not want to be prescriptive, but I can reassure the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Runnymede and Weybridge that we are not trying to take away with one hand what we are giving with another. The power will be used in specific circumstances, primarily to protect children from the activities of child abusers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never took that view of the Minister; I certainly did not expect him to take away
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
with one hand what he had given with another. I was simply trying to investigate the circumstances that he had in mind. He presented a cogent argument of when it would be undesirable to make information available. What I did not understand is whether he intends to make parts of the register automatically inaccessible or inaccessible to certain persons only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The truth is that I am not able to be specific. I have tried to share why we think that the power is necessary. I made it clear that some organisations should have access to the information, and we will ensure that that is the case. I hope the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not make too many express commitments on how the regulatory-making powers will be used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's predicament. It is a sensitive matter. However, just as some people should not have access to information about children's homes, other people should have access to it, which raises the issue of who watches the watchers. I like to think that reputable charities should have access to the information. The Minister might have to construct a complex set of tests in regulations for the most sensitive parts of the register. However, I am grateful to him for clarifying the reasons for the provision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a quick question on a minor point. Subsections (2) and (5) do not seem compatible. Subsection (2) says:
<br><blockquote><p>a letter addressed to a person carrying on or managing an establishment or agency enclosing a notice or other document … shall be deemed to be properly addressed if it is addressed to him at the establishment or agency.</p></blockquote>
However, subsection (5) says:
<br><blockquote><p>For the purposes of this section … without prejudice to subsection (2) … the proper address of a person shall be … in the case of a secretary or clerk of a body corporate, that of the registered or principal office of that body.</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister satisfied that those provisions are compatible?</span></p>

TRANSFERS OF STAFF UNDER PART II</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the transfer of staff. The Minister has answered some of my questions on the issue, but perhaps he will flesh it out so that the Committee can understand the scope and proportions involved. How many employees are eligible? How many inspectors does the Minister expect the commission to employ? If he has such a figure, how many existing employees does he expect to transfer? The Government must have made some estimate of the number of staff who are likely to transfer. If so, it is to be hoped that we can estimate the proportion of existing inspectors that is likely to be included in the mix of inspectors in the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that about 2,000 staff are currently performing the functions for which the National Care Standards Commission will become responsible when it is legally established. The hon. Gentleman asked me how many of those staff will transfer to the commission, but that is an impossible question to answer, because it will depend in part on how many of those people will want to transfer. As has been said, this is not a police state and we cannot force people to work for the commission if they do not choose to do so, although there is no question that many of them will want to join it. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's concerns, we should be careful not to lose the expertise and local knowledge that the inspectors have built up over many years. It would be much harder for the commission to start with completely new staff who have no experience of local inspection. It is currently impossible to provide the answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, although I imagine that a large proportion of the existing staff will transfer.<br><br>
The final size of the commission is still being considered. It will be substantially larger than the number of inspectors, for obvious reasons. It will have about 2,000 or 3,000 staff, but the more detailed arrangements for staff transfer are dealt with in clauses 93 and 94, and the hon. Gentleman may want to return to this theme when we consider those provisions.</span></p>

TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF MEANING OF "NURSING HOME"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart)</span><span class='membercontribution'> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 19, line 13, leave out from "home)" to end of line 17 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(a) in subsection (1), after "(3)" there is inserted "and (3A)",</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) after subsection (3) there is inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The definition in subsection (1) above does not include any premises used, or intended to be used, wholly or mainly by a dental practitioner for the purpose of treating his patients unless subsection (3B) or (3C) below applies.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3B) This subsection applies if—
<ol>
<li>the premises are also used, or intended to be used, by that or another dental practitioner for the purpose of treating his patients under general anaesthesia; and</li>
<li>the premises are not used, or intended to be used, by any dental practitioner for the purpose of treating his patients under general anaesthesia—</li>
<ol>
<li>in pursuance of the National Health Service Act 1977; or</li>
<li>under an agreement made in accordance with Part I of the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3C) This subsection applies if the premises are used, or intended to be used, for the provision of treatment by specially controlled techniques and are not excepted by regulations under subsection (3)(g) above.'".</p></blockquote>
There have been a number of tragedies recently in which young people have died during dental treatment under general anaesthesia outside hospitals. General anaesthesia is never without risk and it appears that it is sometimes administered unnecessarily for dental treatment. There are considered to be safer alternatives to general anaesthesia in dental treatment, such as conscious sedation, which we want to encourage dentists to use in order to minimise avoidable risk. Whenever dental treatment is provided under general anaesthesia, we want to ensure that it is administered in accordance with proper and safe standards. When the National Care Standards Commission is established, it will regulate wholly private provision of general anaesthesia for dental treatment. However, we believe that such an important safeguard cannot wait until the commission is established in 2002. Clause 37 covers private dentists who provide treatment under general anaesthesia under the Registered Homes Act 1984.<br><br>
Under the 1984 Act, dental premises were exempt from registration and inspection, apart from where specially controlled techniques such as the use of lasers were used. The clause will extend the definition of nursing homes in the 1984 Act to include practices that provide general anaesthesia only for private dental treatment. We intend to introduce that provision as soon as possible after the Bill has received Royal Assent. The clause as currently drafted applies both to the public and private sectors, but health authorities already maintain lists of dentists and may inspect premises where NHS work is carried out. A requirement of dual regulation for these dental practitioners would be anomalous, so the amendment excludes dentists who carry out NHS work from having to be regulated under the Registered Homes Act.<br><br>
Amending the clause will in no way lessen the safeguards to the public, as the majority of dentists will carry out some NHS work and will be subject to NHS requirements. We will amend NHS regulations to require the production of a separate list of dentists who provide treatment under general anaesthesia under NHS arrangements and to specify inspection
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
requirements comparable to those which will apply to the private sector. We intend to introduce the amendments when the amendment to the 1984 Act is brought into force. We want to bring within the provisions of the Act that small number of wholly private providers who would otherwise escape any type of regulation. I am sure that the Committee will agree that there is no need to place dentists who provide dental treatment under general anaesthesia for the NHS to be dually registered and that it will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is relatively complex and quadruples the length of a short clause. We have understood the essential purpose from the Minister's explanation. Almost all dentists will be eliminated from the scope of the extension of the regulations because, as the Minister said, the great majority of dentists provide national health service work.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
A significant number of dentists provide no national health service work and I am concerned that we are moving back from the level playing field by subjecting those dentists to an extension of a regulatory regime but not their colleagues. That might encourage dentists with wholly private practices to do token NHS work simply to avoid the relatively onerous registration requirements. I am not sure whether encouraging dentists to do token NHS work is in the interests of the health service.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to the question of general dental anaesthesia performed in the national health service. She will know, because she has answered several parliamentary questions from me on the matter, that I have suggested that the remedy would be simple and to hand if the Government were keen to remove general dental anaesthesia from general dental practice and to see it performed in hospitals. I confess in open Committee that the thought is not original—the British Dental Association suggested it to me. The Government need only remove general dental anaesthesia from the dental red book so that dentists operating in the national health service did not get reimbursed for providing it. I assure the Minister that dentists would immediately cease to provide it.<br><br>
I have asked the Minister on several occasions when the Government intended to make such a change to the dental red book or schedule of fees payable for general dental services—dental red book might be the wrong term—and have been told that they had no plans to do so. That surprises me in view of the direction of their thinking, which has been made clear in what the Minister has said today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the amendment looks complicated. It might be useful if I note that the chief medical officer and chief dental officer have recently completed their review of general anaesthesia for dental treatment. The review has not yet been fully analysed and we would not want to pre-empt its findings. Further, we want to make it clear that further regulation of dentistry, which is also under consideration, should not be pre-empted. We have a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
holding position to ensure that consideration of an area of the private sector that has hitherto been totally unregulated is brought forward at the earliest opportunity and does not wait until 2002. It might be possible to bring all private dentistry within the National Care Standards Commission remit if that seems appropriate at a later stage.<br><br>
I would like to assure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the amendment is in no way intended to create an uneven playing field. It is intended to deal with an area of great public concern, which should be addressed without pre-empting further reviews of dentistry as a whole.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions to put to the Minister in relation to the clause, as amended. I hope that she will forgive me if my mind has not fully incorporated the amendment into the clause; I will do my best. The first question does not touch dentistry. Why has chiropody been singled out for temporary inclusion under the Registered Homes Act? She has explained the circumstances that led the Government to want to deal with dental anaesthesia and dental practice, but was there evidence of major problems surrounding chiropody? Why has that service been singled out?<br><br>
Will the Minister also explain what will happen to dental practitioners who do not provide national health service treatment once the Registered Homes Act 1984 is scrapped? My understanding of the definitions provided in clause 2 of the Bill is that dental practices will be included only if they provide listed services, which, in the case of dentistry, will almost always mean dental treatment under general anaesthesia. Therefore, it seems that private dental practices that do no NHS work and provide no work under general anaesthesia would come within the scope of the Registered Homes Act as soon as the clause comes into force, but will be excluded from the overall provisions of the Bill once the Registered Homes Act is scrapped. If I have misunderstood something, perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to explain how that will work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is the possibility that we have both misunderstood each other. There is ample precedent for that.<br><br>
At the moment, practices in the private sector that provide general anaesthesia will be brought within the provisions. Once the National Care Standards Commission comes into force, it will still be possible to bring other private dentistry within the provision, but a review of dentistry is currently taking place, so we did not want to do that at this stage. We are not doing anything to change the playing field.<br><br>
I also want to deal with the much more important point about clause 2(7)(a) and chiropody. When I first saw the provision, my initial reaction was to ask what the problem was, but, of course, the provision is an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
exemption from the regulation because there is no problem with chiropody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very interesting. Will the Minister give us a definition of chiropody? Does it include podiatry, which I believe is now the "in" word? On occasions, podiatrists, who used to be called chiropodists, carry out some major invasive surgery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dentists and chiropodists who would provide general anaesthesia are not exempted. We want to regulate people who will be involved in giving general anaesthetics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it absolutely clear. Is the Minister saying that any podiatry, which can involve the removal of toes, carried out under a regional block—a local anaesthetic—would not be included in the Bill and would not be regulated?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It would mean that those two areas would be brought under the provisions of the Registered Homes Act, so that they could be regulated before the National Care Standards Commission comes into force in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to go home, wrap a cold towel around my head and look at the Registered Homes Act again. I believe that I stand accused of having misunderstood what clause 37 does to the Registered Homes Act. If I am so guilty, I hold up my hands. However, in her reply, the Minister highlighted something else. I think that she was saying that the Government intend to include, or will consider including, all dental practices within the scope of one of the definitions in clause 2 of the Bill, presumably using the regulation-making powers—the "listed services—mechanism in clause 2(7)(g). That is an interesting extension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes her head. Let me be more succinct. I understood her to say that the Government would consider extending the scope of the National Care Standards Commission to cover all dental practitioners. Is that what she said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dentistry is registered under NHS legislation. We intend that to continue. The way forward depends on the outcome of the submission on the regulation of dentistry. That is all that I am saying.</span></p>

Government amendment No. 276.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that amendment No. 275 is purely technical. Its purpose is to ensure that regulation can be extended to cover services provided directly by local authorities, which will create the level playing field that we all want to see.<br><br>
Amendment No. 276 was tabled in response to concerns that were raised earlier. It would give the Government the power to extend the regulation of agencies to cover those that provide other types of social care workers and health care workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to say about amendment No. 275. I am intrigued, however, by the Minister's explanation of amendment No. 276. It seems to give the Government the power to extend the Bill's provisions to not only persons who provide the relevant services but persons who supply those who provide the relevant services. On the face of it, that could incorporate the whole pharmaceutical industry and the entire medical supplies and equipment industry, because they are all persons who supply those who provide relevant services.<br><br>
I hope and assume that that is not the Government's intention. However, as amendment No. 276 is drafted, it is clearly a possibility. Will the Minister confirm that that cannot happen? Will he tell us where the line will be drawn between those who supply services to those supplying services? In other words, where will the fence be drawn so that we do not have the absurdity of the whole supply train of health provision being caught within the scope of clause 39? I plead for a reasonably tight definition of that extension to those powers, to ensure at least that there is no possibility of it being endlessly widened.<br><br>
Amendment No. 227 seeks explicitly to extend the scope of clause 39. We have already debated the status
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0233">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
of complementary and alternative therapies and whether it is necessary to regulate those sectors. Both Ministers were sympathetic to the argument that we may need to extend the scope of regulation under the Bill to cover some of those services. Clause 39 is rather too tightly drawn to do that effectively. Subsection (2) refers to services similar to those that "may or must" be provided by local authorities, health authorities, special health authorities, NHS trusts or primary care trusts.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Some of the alternative or complementary techniques that hon. Members have used as examples would not fall within that category because they are not at present supplied by the NHS, although I know some hon. Members would like them to be. The amendment seeks to define an additional category of relevant services—those services that, in the opinion of the appropriate Minister, are held out to be for the purpose of "treating or relieving conditions" that might otherwise reasonably be expected to be treated by the relevant services.<br><br>
I am seeking to capture, perhaps imperfectly, the whole range of treatments that alternative and complementary therapies offer as an alternative to conventional services. I say "capture", but I do not suggest that all those services must be regulated. Clause 39 needs to be drafted sufficiently widely to enable regulations to be extended to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We tabled amendment No. 25 to explore the definition of "relevant services". Local authorities and health authorities have an amazingly wide range of services, but they may be found in some areas and not others. I am much taken with the second part of amendment No. 227. Therapeutic claims by practitioners of whatever sort when treating a condition that would normally be treated by a local authority, health authority or private services should be brought within the scope of regulation. People are entitled to basic consumer protection when receiving such treatments. The amendment would be a good way to allow the Bill to give some comfort to vulnerable people who spend large sums of money on little-tested and ill-proven interventions. I certainly support amendment No. 276.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks of little-tested and ill-proven alternative and complementary remedies. Does he accept that there is a double-edged sword? Regulation is about protecting the legitimate parts of those practices; many practitioners would welcome regulation as a way of ridding themselves of the charlatans who hang around the edges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Brand</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I was not decrying the value of complementary medicine. I may not understand it, but I know that it can do a great deal of good—and often a great deal less harm—than more orthodox practices.<br><br>
Amendment No. 276 is acceptable, provided that the Minister thinks about a different criterion of inclusion of services related more to the claims that are made than to the category of intervention.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I start by dealing with the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about new subsection (3), as proposed in amendment No. 276. I can understand his difficulty because the wording is dense—I think that that is the best way of describing it.<br><br>
There are many references to providing services for the purposes of supplying, and so on. I understand that the hon. Gentleman may not have had the opportunity to consider the amendment carefully, but if he does so, he will see that the intention behind new subsection (3) is clear. We explained during an earlier debate that we wanted to use clause 39 to extend regulatory requirements to other types of employment agencies and to businesses that were providing other sorts of care staff than nurses. Indeed, similar concern was expressed by other hon. Members. The amendment is designed purely to achieve that purpose and not to regulate pharmacists or other workers, including those in the categories to which the hon. Gentleman referred. We want to make it clear that the clause allows us to bring within the commission's regulatory scope employment agencies and other businesses that are providing other types of care workers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider the matter and be reassured. I have fully explained our intention on how the new regulatory power will be used.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight wants the Bill to refer specifically to complementary therapies. That is certainly what amendment No. 25 seeks to achieve, although he may have other intentions. I understand that it is a probing amendment, but it would insert into the Bill specific reference to complementary therapies and nurse-led services. I am not entirely sure that such reference is necessary, because the clause, as amended, makes it clear that the definition includes services that are similar to those that are already provided by the national health service. Some complementary therapies and nurse-led services are, therefore, already within the Bill's scope. However, if the hon. Gentleman wants some reassurance about that, he might like to be made aware of some of the complementary therapies that are currently provided in some parts of the national health service. They include homoeopathy, osteopathy, herbal medicines, chiropractic, acupuncture, healing aromatherapy and reflexology.<br><br>
I do not want to hold out the prospect of the National Care Standards Commission being give at a stroke new regulatory responsibilities across the range of such services. We have made it clear that it will have enough work to do in simply carrying on existing regulatory and inspection responsibilities that are currently discharged by local authorities and health authorities. It also will have to take on new responsibilities in respect of children's homes and local authority homes and some additional work on day centres, domiciliary care agencies and nursing agencies, which it will take on at some future time. It has a full menu of work under way. We are trying to ensure that we do not have to revisit the provision. We have a chance to ensure that we do not have to revisit the provision. We have a chance to get the regulation-making powers in the clause right and we are trying to construct them in a way that gives us the flexibility to extend regulation when such provision is appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his last few sentences, the Minister made one of the points that I wanted to put to him. He said that the provision was about future-proofing the Bill. He read out a list of the complementary and alternative therapies that are available in the NHS. Does he accept, however, that the ones that are most in need of regulating are likely to be those which are at the fringe and which, almost by definition, will be available from the NHS? It is with that in mind that we seek to provide a definition that would extend beyond what the NHS thought it appropriate to provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair argument. We are trying to be clear with the Committee about what we intend to use the regulation-making power and to share with it our thinking on the extent of such power that is provided by the clause. I am not quite sure what services the hon. Gentleman has in mind or whether he is urging the commission to assume new regulatory responsibilities. Will he let us know? The power that we are discussing is important.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, we are trying to make it as future-proof as possible. The amended wording of the clause would give us the flexibility for which he has asked in relation to making regulations regarding complementary therapies, if that were thought necessary. To be fair, the amendment would probably also cover the concern of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. The area is sensitive and complex. We do not intend to load the commission with new regulatory responsibilities when it has plenty to be getting on with.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight, I have no plans to share with the Committee to regulate such therapies. As a general rule, we should make the regulatory power as flexible as we can while making clear the areas in which we anticipate powers being used in future. We are trying to do that today.</span></p>

INTRODUCTORY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 210, in page 19, line 31, after "means" insert
<br><blockquote><p>'the appointment of visitors under paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 of the 1989 Act,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 211, in page 20, line 10, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) In carrying out its functions under subsection (1) in respect of the appointment of visitors for children by local authorities under paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the 1989 Act, the registration authority shall seek the views of the court which made the care order in respect of the child or children.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tabled the amendment with my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess), who apologises to the Committee that he has a longstanding engagement that makes it impossible for him to attend this afternoon. I will address most of my remarks to amendment No. 210 and then briefly say a word about amendment No. 211, which is both complementary and consequential to amendment No. 210.<br><br>
The clause deals with the appointment of independent visitors, a duty imposed on local authorities by schedule 2 of the Children Act 1989. That arises when it appears to a local authority that a child in care has not been visited by a parent, another person with parental responsibility or otherwise not visited in the previous 12 months. In such cases, the Act says that the local authority shall appoint an independent visitor. The question of independence from the local authority is determined by regulations made by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
There are are two general reasons why schedule 2 of the Children Act 1989 is important. However, the schedule is widely ignored, a situation that the amendments address. First, it is obviously and inherently good that somebody should visit a child in care who is not otherwise being visited. Children in care are among the most vulnerable members of our community; the Bill is about vulnerable people. It is thoroughly good that a non-professional outside the system should visit a child who has not been visited by anybody outside for twelve months. The second, more specific and sadder reason is that the outside person who is not part of the system and who, above all, does not have a career at stake is most likely to be the whistle-blower when something is going wrong in the child's home.<br><br>
I was gravely concerned to hear that a report called "Somebody else's children" found that between a third and a half of local authorities were unaware of the duty to provide independent visitors. Of the authorities that did know of the duty, roughly half did not comply. The remainder tended to farm the responsibility out to a voluntary body or agency. I do not have a problem with that. Voluntary bodies involved include Voice for the Child in Care and the Prince's Trust.<br><br>
We have both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that most local authorities are ignoring a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
perfectly clear section of an Act that was passed with all-party support. The opportunity is to find a way of making them adhere to it. That is why amendment No. 210 would require the commission to determine whether local authorities are carrying out that specific function.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
The report found that half the authorities were doing nothing and that half of the remainder were unwilling to act. Is that important? I gave two reasons for why it is, but common sense is not the only consideration. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children published a thorough report, which I shall be happy to pass on to the Minister. It was written by young people who had been through the complaints procedure and who made positive comments on independent persons. The young people who were interviewed made it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>Independent persons were seen to be friendly, trustworthy, have authority and showed respect for their confidence. Research on Independent Persons projects in their developmental stage indicates that young people are not so sure that Independent Persons are able to have any impact on the outcomes of the procedure.</p></blockquote>
The report concluded that although not all young people were clear about the role of independent persons, the majority believed that it was of value. The report also concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>The Independent element which the Independent Person adds to the procedure</p></blockquote>
during an investigation
<br><blockquote><p>was valued by Investigating Officers and young people.</p></blockquote>
The subject was batted about in the all-party group for children and young people in care which is chaired by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). I do not know whether its meetings were held in private or public, but he has given me permission to refer to its interesting discussion. The all-party group raised two matters. The first was whether independent visitors played a valuable role. The second was introduced by a social worker who said that independent visitors should be professional social workers. A couple of young people who had been in care quickly got up to say, "Not on your Nelly." They believed that independent visitors should have been through care themselves. Failing that, they wanted them to be genuinely independent of the professional system. A formal NSPCC study and the testimony of some young people in care shows that independent visitors are a good idea.<br><br>
As for whistleblowing, I was recently privileged to hear the testimony of a brave lady—a professional social worker—who blew the whistle on what was happening in those Welsh homes. I heard a similar testimony from someone who blew the whistle on the terrible goings-on in a home for people with learning disabilities. The common point was that professionals blew the whistle at the price of destroying their professional careers. Schedule 2 of the Children Act 1989, which the amendment attempts to resurrect, would ensure that there were always independent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
people available who could speak up without putting their careers on the line.<br><br>
There is no shortage of voluntary organisations who are willing to help. The other day, I went to a presentation given by one such organisation—I recognise a couple of familiar faces on the other side of the Committee who were also there. The Prince's Trust has the worthy ambition of having sufficient candidates for independent visitors within the next two or three years to be able to provide an independent visitor to up to 10 per cent. of all the children in care. I hope that the Committee will not think that I am being flippant when I say that there is a certain family irony in the fact that that should be the ambition of the Prince's Trust. The remarkable fact was recently published that the Prince's own father spent 10 years at boarding school without ever receiving a visitor because his father was dead and his mother lived in a convent on the other side of Europe. It seems to me that this measure has already been passed once by Parliament, but slipped through the cracks. A social worker drew my attention to the fact that the provision was being ignored by most local authorities. Amendment No. 210 would simply include in the duties of the National Care Standards Commission and its Welsh counterpart a duty to consider that.<br><br>
I want to say a quick word on amendment No. 211, which deals with the interface with the previous problem and another very old grievance, which I hope we shall be able to discuss in a wider context on Thursday in relation to our debates on clauses 41 and 42. I have received testimony from a couple of very senior barristers that the courts are becoming increasingly fed up with their legal inability to follow up care orders that have been agreed with local authorities. Amendment No. 211 raises a narrow aspect of that wider problem, which relates to the suggestion that an independent visitor should be appointed. The amendment proposes that the commission should also liaise with the courts where the court has suggested that an independent visitor would be appropriate for a child.<br><br>
The Minister of State adopted a very constructive approach in some of our previous debates, and I welcome the fact that, on 6 July, he will address the all-party committee of which I am privileged to be co-chairman. I ask him not to tell me that he is booting the amendments out because they are technically defective; I am sure that they are, but they were introduced as probing amendments to generate a debate on an important issue. I am not expecting him to say that he will accept the amendments as drafted. However, I hope that he will give the Committee an assurance that he will think about what I have said and consider the possibility of introducing a professionally drafted clause or pair of clauses on Report to do something about that very important legal gap and deal with a matter on which, with all-party support, Parliament has already legislated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has made some extremely important points about the isolation of children in care. The statutory duty to appoint independent inspectors under the Children Act 1989 has not been properly enforced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0236">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
throughout the country. The hon. Gentleman's claims for independent visitors are slightly over-optimistic. Some young people would not necessarily welcome the attention of independent visitors and their feelings should be taken into account. I do not agree that the matter should be taken back to the courts. The National Care Standards Commission will have a crucial role in considering the care plans of children in care. Where care orders have been made on the basis of care plans and those care plans have not been fulfilled, that is a very serious matter indeed. Returning to court over an issue such as independent visitors would be cumbersome and unwieldy and add to delays in a system that is already beset by them.<br><br>
The nub of the hon. Gentleman's argument is absolutely sound: a large proportion of young people in care do not have access to independent support and would benefit greatly from independent advocacy. I hope that we have the opportunity to discuss new clause 1, which suggests that all looked-after young people should have a statutory right to advocacy. That approach is suggested by a number of national child care organisations and reflects the fact that the young can become embroiled in a system where decision making often goes on over their heads and where their views are not listened to. Their voice is not heard properly when big decisions affecting their lives are made.<br><br>
The Bill is profoundly important. The very concept of a children's rights director is a tremendous step forward in establishing the rights of children in care and in improving their conditions. Until we actually hear the voices of children in care very loudly and very clearly, we will continue to have difficulties with the system. We need better systems for recruiting, training and supporting independent visitors, whom I agree should not be social workers. They should be people from outside the social work group. We need a much stronger statutory right for children in care to access in advocacy, in order to support their views in similar complex and difficult decisions that are taken in respect of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Canterbury for the work he does in this area. He predicted that I would be rather horrid to him, saying that his amendments were terribly defective and that I therefore could not possibly accept them—and sit down. I am not going to do that. His amendments are technically defective, as he was the first to mention. There is a particular problem with amendment No. 211 which refers to the court being notified. Many children who go into care will not be the subject of a court order in the way that the hon. Gentleman has described and, therefore, it would be rather odd for the local authority to be hunting around for some court to notify. There would not be one. The court has no jurisdiction over the independent adviser either, so it would not be clear what purpose would be served by notifying it. However, I shall leave those arguments on one side, as the hon. Gentleman raised some much more important issues about the role of independent visitors.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman feels that many local authorities do not comply with their requirements under paragraph (17) of schedule 2 of the Children Act
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
1989 to make sure that an independent visitor is appointed, and we know this to be the case. He rightly referred to the 1998 report, "Someone Else's Children", that drew attention to those issues. He will be aware that, in response to the Utting report on safeguards for children, the Government made clear how that problem would be addressed. He will also be aware of our views on those matters. We plan to address those concerns about safeguarding the welfare of children in care through the quality protects programme which started in April 1999 and is therefore now in its second year. We made it a requirement for this year's management action plans in relation to quality protects that local authorities advise the Department of Health about the steps that they have been taking to comply with the Children Act obligation to appoint independent visitors. I have not yet had the benefit of seeing the management action plans that have so far been submitted. My officials are considering them and I would be happy to reflect on the information contained in the 150 plans that we have received, which will allow all of us with an interest in children's welfare and in developing safeguards for children to plot the progress—or lack of it—that is being made.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Canterbury and my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made important contributions on the role that independent visitors can play. We are fully on board with that view, as I think all hon. Members are. I must tell the hon. Member for Canterbury that we are taking action and that we will pursue the matter. There is a clear legal obligation with which we expect local authorities to comply. We are approaching the issue of compliance through the quality protects programme. Perhaps it is not to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction that we are doing so. His solution would be to give commission responsibility for monitoring compliance with the Children Act.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
The best way of securing progress is through the measures that we are taking as part of the quality protects programme. We will not hesitate to use our powers to withdraw a subsequent quality protects grant payment to a local authority if we do not feel that sufficient progress is being recorded. We have always made it clear that no local authorities will have an absolute entitlement to the next tranche of quality protects money. They have to show us that they are making progress. We have asked specifically for evidence of such progress, which is an important milestone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is advancing an interesting argument. He is suggesting that the most effective way of persuading people to do something is to offer them an incentive, notwithstanding statutory requirements. In this case and in most others, that incentive is money. Will the Minister reflect on what he has been saying to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury? How do his remarks relate to earlier debates about the relative value of legislation and statutory obligations in comparison with positive incentives for people to behave in the manner that the Government believe to be appropriate and in the best public interest?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0237">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might have read too much into my remarks. If a local authority has a legal obligation, it should comply with it. That goes without saying. Moreover, other parties might be able to act upon some enforcement issues. The issue for the Government and for its relationship to local authorities is to make significant steps forward in ensuring compliance with legal obligations. That is what we are trying to achieve. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is inviting me to return to the subject of the costs to care homes and other establishments of compliance with the national minimum required standards, but we have had those arguments and moved on. There will be an opportunity to return to them, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will seek to ensure that we take that opportunity. He will know that it is mainly local authorities that commission the services that he describes and that they will have to consider how quality improvements will be reflected in the commissioning progress. That is an obvious reality. He is asking me to tell the Committee whether more money will be available, but, as he will know, my response to that is that the spending review announcements will be made later in the year. That will be the time for him and other Opposition Members to discuss the arithmetic of additional resources for social services, which will, of course, be available.<br><br>
The central point made by the hon. Member for Canterbury was about taking further steps to ensure compliance. I an not ruling out the use of legal compliance and I am not in a position to do so. I am saying merely that we are trying to encourage further compliance through the quality protects programme. In that respect, I think that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge tried to put a rather crude interpretation on to my remarks.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made an important point about the wider issue of advocacy services, especially in relation to children in the care system. He takes a close and welcome interest in these issues, so he will know that the Children (Leaving Care) Bill will be debated tomorrow on the Floor of the House. The Bill will make a significant milestone in improving care for children who are being looked after by local authorities and will ensure that we do not discard the next generation of looked-after children in the same way as previous generations were discarded. Those children have low ambitions—or no ambition. We must bring about a culture change. The Bill is one way to achieve it.<br><br>
I would be the first to acknowledge that advocacy will play a most important part in improving services for the welfare of looked-after children. We are looking actively at how to ensure that all children in the looked-after care system have access to an effective advocate whenever one is needed. I am sure that we shall have more to say about that tomorrow at Second Reading of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
the Children (Leaving Care) Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre can be reassured—I hope that he is—that advocacy is taken seriously by the Government. We shall pursue that significantly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Canterbury has done the Committee a favour by drawing attention to the wider issues. We are aware of the apparent problems caused by the appointment of independent visitors, and we want local authorities to comply fully with their legal responsibilities. Some of them may not, which is profoundly disappointing. Parliament passes laws and we expect people to act upon them. If they do not, sanctions and other measures need to be taken. We are pursuing those matters with local authorities.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured, at least in part, by what I have said. He and I may want to discuss the matter further on 6 July; he helpfully reminded me—I hope that my office has made a note of the date—that I am due to meet him and his colleagues to talk about adoption. I must admit, Mr. Gale, that I had forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the last comment, I welcome the Minister's constructive statement. I shall obviously withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
The quality protects programme obviously commands widespread support, and I welcome the Minister's assurance that it will be prominent. However, he must accept that an enormous number of areas will need to be monitored. I feel that an opportunity has been missed by not giving the National Care Standards Commission, which has been established outside the framework, the specific function of overseeing that programme. The Committee agrees that when Parliament passes a law, especially one with all-party support, it should be enforced. The Minister said that it may not happen; indeed, it clearly is not happening, as shown in the report to which I referred.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's assurances on the quality protects programme, but if there is no rapid progress, I hope that he will think again about legislating to give responsibility to the National Care Standards Commission. That will be a belt-and-braces provision for something that is very important. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
