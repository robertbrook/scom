PERSONS REFERRED FOR INCLUSION IN LIST UNDER PROTECTION OF CHILDREN ACT 1989</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 443, in page 50, line 40, leave out from beginning to 'apply' in line 43 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'—() Section 2(4) to (7) of the 1999 Act (referrals for inclusion in list of individuals who are considered unsuitable to work with children) shall, in the case of any reference under Section 2 or 2A of the Act,'.—[<i>Mr. Hutton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>2.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering the following: Government amendments Nos. 444 to 452.<br><br>
Government new clause 25—<i>Power of registration authority to refer</i><br><br>
Government new clause 26—<i>Individuals named in the findings of certain inquiries</i><br><br>
Government new clause 27—<i>Inclusion in 1999 Act list on reference by certain authorities</i><br><br>
Government new clause 28—<i>Inclusion in 1999 Act list of individuals named in findings of certain inquiries</i><br><br>
Government new clause 29—<i>Transfer from Consultancy Service Index of individuals named in past inquiries</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had almost finished my point. The Minister pulled my leg in the interval in pointing out that the group of amendments was tabled on Friday, so I should have seen it yesterday. However, the point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) still stands. There are some very complicated amendments to several pieces of legislation on this important matter. Although I welcome the principle behind them, it would have been nice if Opposition Members had been briefed properly so that they could contribute to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) pointed out, the new clauses are in order. They were tabled in time, hence their appearance on the amendment paper and selection for debate today. They are grouped under clause 79 because they are relevant to it and should be debated in that sequence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to contribute to debate on this set of amendments, as much as anything to thank the Minister for taking time between sittings to explain, in words of one syllable, in five minutes flat, to those with simple minds like me, what the new clauses are intended to achieve. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
wish that we could always have similarly concise and helpful conversations. His explanation certainly put the matter in a nutshell for me.<br><br>
As the Minister pointed out, for my benefit and for the benefit of other members of the Committee and other Opposition parties, the nub was to prevent a loophole. For example, following the Waterhouse report, there were individuals who might not have resigned or been made redundant, but who were named for misconduct, Without the changes made under the new clauses, those people might slip through the net and gain positions where vulnerable people would be put at risk. The opportunity to close that loophole is a strong argument for the new clauses.<br><br>
Now that I have had a little time to read the new clauses, although not as comprehensively as I would have liked, I have one or two questions. What is the position of the employer who gives somebody a job in which they have regular contact with vulnerable people and could place those people at risk if, when taking on that person, the employer had no idea that they were on the list? If such people go on the list after they have been employed, can or must employers dismiss them? Is there any way in which an employer might be found guilty of an offence if it is discovered that somebody in their employ had gone on the list after they were taken on? Could the employer use the defence that he or she did not know that the person was on the list when they were employed? For the sake of employers, we need clarification.<br><br>
For the record, while I was temporarily out of the Room this morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) accepted that new clause 25 captures the intention of amendment No. 370. I could not, of course, raise objections to something that has achieved what we set out to do.<br><br>
Finally, I wondered whether we had again been attacked by the gremlins that attacked the amendments on 27 June, giving rise to an extraordinary set of hieroglyphics to describe some subsections. It was neatly corrected by the provisional selection of amendments alerting us to the fact that subsections rarely begin with letters. However, among the new clauses, subsections are again referred to by letters, and the same typographical errors appear to have arisen. New clause 26(7)(a)(i) refers to section jlc. Should those identifiers be letters? I could not find subsection jlc and do not know whether it exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been made. It may have been my fault that I did not give the Committee the explanation that I was apparently able to give in five minutes to the hon. Lady in the Tea Room. Perhaps my explanation made sense because I was not using my speaking notes.<br><br>
Several Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, have complained about short notice and inability to consider the new clauses properly. I point out to the hon. Gentleman, and also to the hon. Member for Canterbury, that the new clauses were tabled properly on Friday and printed on Tuesday. There is no reason why the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 617</span>
Member for Sutton and Cheam should not have had plenty of time to think about his response to them.<br><br>
I am intrigued by the idea that a new clause should attract an explanatory note. Perhaps the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will follow that practice for the new clauses that he has tabled. That would benefit Members on both sides of the Committee. He has been a Member for a while—as has the hon. Member for Canterbury, who has sat on the Government Benches during many Standing Committees and I am sure would not be able to recall a single occasion when a Government produced an explanatory note to a new clause. Perhaps he does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 24, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) indeed has an explanatory note, circulated by the all-party group on adoption—a copy of which should have reached the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, there we are; I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his correction. His practice may be a new departure on which others might need to reflect. He will certainly be aware that it is not the usual practice and convention for new clauses to attract a separate set of explanatory notes. It is the job of the Minister—sometimes we do it well, sometimes we do not do it well—to explain new clauses to the Committee to its satisfaction or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My beef was not about the tabling but about the details—and explanatory notes. I take the Minister's comment about convention and practice, but draw to his attention the practice in two Committees on which I have served. Numerous new clauses were tabled to the Greater London Authority Bill, and Ministers did Committee members the courtesy of circulating explanatory notes. The same is true of some complicated new clauses to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill that is before Parliament. I hope that the Minister will occasionally consider the practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will occasionally consider it, as the hon. Gentleman asks; indeed, I am happy to give him the assurance that I will occasionally consider that point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) asked a specific question about the action that an employer who subsequently discovers that someone is on the list would be required to take. We dealt with that under amendment No. 441. An employer would be required to take some action to remove that person from a position in which a vulnerable adult, for example, could be harmed. It might not necessarily mean dismissal; the person could be moved to other employment. We covered that point and closed that loophole with amendment No. 441.<br><br>
I am sorry that this collection of amendments has provoked the concerns that have been expressed. It was not our intention to provoke any anxiety. Some of the new clauses, particularly new clauses 26 and 28, deal with the issue with which we must grapple in the aftermath of the Waterhouse report. We certainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
want to ensure that, if those circumstances arise in future, the Secretary of State has the power to refer to the list people who otherwise could not be referred because they do not meet the conditions for referral that are specifed in the Bill.<br><br>
We are closing a loophole; the power will not be used very often, but we certainly would not want people who have been named in an inquiry report to escape the consequences of subsequent inclusion on the list. The list is there to protect children and vulnerable adults and, therefore, must be as comprehensive and up to date as possible. Giving the Secretary of State such opportunities to refer people to the list will ensure that both of those objectives are met.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should inform the hon. Member for Meriden that new clause 26 does contain a typographical error. It might be down to the original drafting of the amendments on the computer, which should normally change references such as the one that appears into numbers. We will assume that the printers made that error.<br><br>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EFFECT OF INCLUSION IN 1996 ACT LIST</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some questions for the Minister; they may arise simply from ignorance on my part over the definitions in other legislation. The words "child care organisation" are used in the clause 83 but, on checking the Protection of Children Act 1999, I did not find them. My concern is that that might be a little unclear. Perhaps the Minister could help me.<br><br>
The issue is important in the light of our debate on the great deal of new responsibility on employers. Ensuring that something is done about people who are taken on but subsequently put on the list is a good new responsibility, I hasten to add, but given the plethora of child care organisations, ranging from quite large organisations to very small ones, I am concerned about how clear small organisations, such as informal play groups, might be about their responsibilities. Would they check that employees are safe and suitable to be working with children? I wondered whether the Minister could help me with that term.</span></p>
<p>2.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to deal with the hon. Lady's concerns. If she refreshes her memory by looking at the Protection of Children Act 1999, she will see a definition of child care organisations in section 12(1). We are currently consulting on some guidelines and regulations that will bring the Protection of Children Act into effect, in which we attempt to specify what the statutory references are in relation to paragraph (b), defining child care organisations. We have set out in a draft set of regulations the statutes that would be regarded as prescribed enactments for those purposes. There is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
definition in the Protection of Children Act and I hope that she will now be able to find it.</span></p>

WELFARE OF CHILDREN IN BOARDING SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 485, in page 54, line 25, leave out '(4)' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A)'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 486, in page 55, line 40, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) For the side note to section 87 of the 1989 Act there shall be substituted "Welfare of children accommodated in boarding schools and colleges".'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments obviously go together, but the more substantial is amendment No. 486, which was prompted by a desire on the part of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to ensure that a side note to section 87 of the Children Act 1989 was consistent with what the Government are trying to achieve here. It is designed to be helpful and constructive to the Government. It has been apparent that we all want to close loopholes and to cross-refer to existing legislation. If amendment No. 486 is accepted, it will also be necessary to accept amendment No. 485. I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady began by saying that this was an amendment that the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was anxious to table. It certainly carries his hallmark. It is another helpful piece of drafting. We are grateful to him and I am sure that she will relay that message to him.<br><br>
Amendment No. 485 is not strictly necessary because we do not need to lay the ground for changing the side note to what a section of an Act provides. The hon. Lady is absolutely right about the point behind amendment No. 486, however. I accept in principle what it is designed to do, but we think we have a better way of doing it. Parliamentary counsel are advising us on that. We expect to table a last batch of amendments on Friday, and one of those will cover the point, so I would be grateful if she would withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will convey the Minister's kind remarks to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No 417, in page 54, line 30, after 'school' insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'or college'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 418 to 421, 423 and 424 to 426.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 417 is simply a tidying amendment. Clause 85 amends section 87 of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
the Children Act 1989. Clause 85(2) re-enacts section 87(2) of the 1989 Act and provides that the provisions do not apply when the school is a children's home or a care home. The amendment makes it clear that, in addition, the provisions do not apply to further education colleges when they are children's homes or care homes.<br><br>
Amendment No. 421 is needed to bring consistency in the application of section 62 of the 1989 Act. The section imposes functions on local authorities with regard to children accommodated by voluntary organisations. Clause 85(5) amends section 62 by disapplying it to schools that are voluntary organisations. The amendment does the same for colleges.<br><br>
Amendment No. 418 clarifies the meaning of an appropriate authority in relation to section 87 welfare inspections. The 1989 Act has a different definition of an appropriate authority in section 68 and needs to keep that definition. We therefore need to clarify the fact that the appropriate authority in relation to section 87 inspections under the 1989 Act means the National Care Standards Commission in England, and the National Assembly for Wales in Wales. Amendment No. 418 provides a solution to that problem.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 425 and 426 are consequential on amendment No. 418. Amendment No. 425 applies the definition of appropriate authority to sections 65 and 65A of the 1989 Act rather than the whole Act. Amendment No. 426 corrects an earlier proofing error. Amendments Nos. 419, 420, 423 and 424 are purely technical amendments that correct the definition of further education corporations. The current definition needs to be amended to refer properly to the institution conducted by further education corporations.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 482, in page 55, line 1, leave out 'any other case' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'all cases'.</p></blockquote></span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>(6A) In subsection (6) the power of inspection of children does not include any medical or physical inspection of any child unless—

</ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments return us to arguments that we have rehearsed. Amendment No. 482 is designed to make the provision more comprehensive by inserting "all cases" and leaving out "any other case". That would clearly be comprehensive.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
Amendment No. 483 would mirror the debate that we had about entering premises at a "reasonable" time. We would like to insert "reasonable" for the reasons that we gave then. In practical terms, it would not be reasonable to enter a school or college when it was closed to its pupils. Much like this place, a lot of work can go on in school holidays and the condition of the premises at that time may not in any way reflect their condition when things are in full swing. It is common sense that inspections need to take place at a time that will be fruitful for the inspectors and for those running the premises. I would expect common sense to be used, and the amendment is an effort to ensure that.<br><br>
We have also rehearsed the argument on amendment No. 484, but it is important to the subject of boarding schools and colleges. Any physical or medical inspection could be traumatic for some young people. While such inspections are possible, we feel that two conditions should be fulfilled. The first is that a medical practitioner or registered nurse should be present at a medical or physical inspection, and the second is that parents should give their consent. Without those conditions, I can envisage children explaining what has happened to their parents and distressing them as a result, even if they are not themselves distressed. We want to prevent a situation that could be unnecessarily distressing for the young people involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hilton Dawson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster and Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept that children who go to boarding schools may be out of contact with parents for a considerable length of time? Is she seriously saying that someone who takes on the serious job of inspecting somewhere like that should not take up the issue if a child displays bruises or a physical injury? What are the inspectors supposed to do in that situation? Is she not abrogating their professional responsibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not hear my remarks when I began moving the amendment. We do not preclude the need for such an inspection, but believe that it needs to fulfil two important conditions. Although the children in question may have been away from their parents, they have not been away in care; their parents have chosen to send them to boarding school. I would be astonished if there were not, in today's world, modern methods of communication between the school and parents by which consent could be obtained. The child is unlikely to be estranged from its parent. Any parent would know that, in the event of an emergency, a school must have immediate contact numbers. Therefore, it would not be difficult to obtain consent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment briefly on amendment No. 484. Amendments Nos. 482 and 483 deal with simple matters of common sense, and I hope that the Government will feel able to accept them immediately.<br><br>
First, I should declare an interest: I spent most of my schooling at boarding schools. I was intrigued by the intervention from the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson). My parents were abroad for all the period and my schooling was partly funded by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 623</span>
the state because my father was an Army officer. Somehow I managed to go to Oxford, because the Chancellor's ban had not been introduced then. Before supporting the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden, I would like to respond to the intervention from the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. As his interventions invariably do, it provoked thought.<br><br>
I focus on the word "guardian" at the end of amendment No. 484. I do no know whether it is a legal requirement, but it is the practice of independent boarding schools that children whose parents are abroad must have a guardian in this country who is readily accessible. There are a whole range of circumstances in which a school may need an immediate point of contact for an important matter affecting the welfare of a child.<br><br>
There is an important principle involved. The Minister knows that I, along with several other members of the Committee, have been engaged in issues of child abuse. I have always supported the right of the various authorities to carry out intrusive examinations when it is necessary to show up possibilities of abuse. However, we should apply the same context to the position of children in school as at home. I find it worrying that somebody—a doctor, nurse or whoever—could at short notice perform a physical examination on the children without any obvious medical necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not been to boarding school and nor have my kids, but if they did attend boarding school and someone rang me up to tell me, "Your child's covered in bruises and I want to have a good look at them," I would say, "Yes, by all means". I would certainly not wait to put my consent in writing. This whole thing is extremely odd.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are debating not the situation that could arise internally within the school, where outside inspectors come in to inspect a problem at the school rather than an individual child. The arrangements for the medical care of children within a school already cover such circumstances. The clause extends a power that already exists in most independent schools to certain other schools, most of them in the state's control, thus bringing them into line. Our amendment simply says that people carrying out those outside inspections, the purpose of which is to ascertain the overall condition of a school, should not be able to start doing physical examinations of individual children without using either a doctor or nurse, and having the permission of the parents or guardian. It is eminently sensible. If the Minister can find a technical defect, and feels that it would interfere with a medical emergency, I am sure that with his huge resources he could make suitable changes to it.</span></p>
<p>3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to speak on this, but with the greatest respect to the hon. Members for Canterbury and for Meriden, they display the most extraordinary complacency about the issue. The idea that because one is in a residential school and not in care, one is more protected is belied by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
considerable number of people who come to my surgeries to tell me of the sort of abuse that they suffered in residential schools in the past.<br><br>
Children in those circumstances are often some of the most vulnerable in our society. They are less regulated than children who are in care or in other situations. The idea that children in residential schools or boarding schools always have parents who are readily available is surprising. The whole tenor of the Opposition's argument is typical of much of the debate: the state is seen as something that is there not to protect children, but to interfere. Conservative Members must get to grips with this. Their amendment represents a diminution in the protection afforded to children under the Children Act 1989 and we should not support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Canterbury hoped that I would be able to accept his amendment. I am always keen to comply with his reasonable request but sadly I cannot do so. I accept that the amendments make obvious common sense, but some important points must be raised here. Amendment No. 482, moved by the hon. Member for Meriden, would require the National Care Standards Commission to notify the Secretary of State in "all cases" where it believes that a boarding school or college is failing to meet its duty of welfare towards a child. The hon. Lady said that that would be consistent with earlier parts of the Bill and would provide a level playing field.<br><br>
We must be clear about the purpose of referring a report to the Secretary of State. Under the current system, and the way we propose to do it in the Bill, if the National Care Standards Commission has these concerns, its report will go to the appropriate body, which can then take action. The Secretary of State does not have the power to take action in relation to state-maintained schools. The local education authority has that power. The Secretary of State's specific functions and responsibilities in respect of action that might need to be taken relate to independent schools, further education colleges with boarding provision or non-maintained special schools. In respect of other schools, however, such as state schools, it is the local authorities' responsibility to take action if the National Care Standards Commission raises anxieties with them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Meriden is aware that there is ample provision in the education legislation for the Secretary of State to take action to ensure that LEAs undertake enforcement action, or whatever else might be necessary, when the report has been sent to them. Why should the information go to the Secretary of State, who is not the person to take action? The report should go to those who are empowered and under an obligation to take action, and the hon. Lady's amendment would make that more difficult.<br><br>
Amendment No. 483 would require the commission to carry out the inspection of welfare in boarding schools and colleges at a reasonable time. I wonder whether the amendment is the hon. Lady's attempt to get round an earlier definition that referred to daylight. We do not need to rehearse arguments about winter and summer or, indeed, spring and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 625</span>
autumn and north and south. The further north one goes in the summer, the longer the hours of daylight. It would probably not be appropriate to have a debate on that subject, tempting though it may be.<br><br>
The concept of reasonableness would not add anything of substance to the Bill—unless the hon. Lady felt that it would make it harder for a National Care Standards Commission inspector to make an unannounced visit, perhaps when the children were asleep. If that is not her intention, it is difficult to see precisely what her amendment would add to the Bill, given that the commission and its inspectors have a responsibility to act reasonably. A case has not been made for the amendment; it is not clear what would be the consequences of its inclusion and how the hon. Lady envisages that it would work in a practical sense.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre was right to say that we cannot accept amendments that would tie the hands of the inspectors in exercising their responsibilities. The hon. Lady would not want that; nor would parents or the Government. Superficially, the amendment looks attractive, given that the commission is already under an obligation to act reasonably, but the hon. Lady has not been able to explain what difference it would make to the way in which the National Care Standards Commission discharged its functions—although she may do so in a moment. I shall, however, advise my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 404 raises different issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre made a convincing argument against the amendment being accepted and I strongly agree with him.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Canterbury drew on his experience as a child at boarding school. He referred to the requirement for an educational guardian who could consent to the procedures. I am unaware of any such legal requirement; the only person who could give consent when something goes wrong and surgical intervention, for example, is needed, would be someone who has parental responsibility for the child. I do not think that that is what the hon. Gentleman meant by an educational guardian. Consent for such a procedure would have to be given by someone who had parental responsibility under the Children Act.<br><br>
The amendment raises a wider issue: under what circumstances would a commission inspector who is not a nurse or a doctor record information about physical injury to a child? We want the commission inspector to be able to record any obvious physical sign that a child has been abused. If, for example, a child were to say to an inspector, "Look at my arm, my back and my leg", it would be preposterous for the commissioner to say, "I'm terribly sorry; I'd like to, but I can't." That would be a nonsense and we could not include such a proposal, deliberately, or by inadvertence, in the Bill. With the hon. Lady's amendment, there is a risk that that would happen.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
The regulations issued under the Children Act do not make provision for parental consent; they mention the child giving or withholding consent to allow the inspector to complete a physical examination of the child. As we develop new regulations, we will need to consider the right balance to strike between protecting children from abuse and allowing for parents' natural interest in having a say in what happens to their children at boarding schools. We will have to consider that carefully and consult the relevant interested parties to ensure that we get the new regulations right.<br><br>
The amendment that the hon. Lady proposed appears attractive on the surface, but might impede the ability of the National Care Standards Commission inspectors to safeguard the interests of children. It would be very unusual for National Care Standards Commission inspectors to carry out routine physical examinations, and clearly, we do not have that in mind. In developing the guidance and the regulations, we may have to give attention to that point. My instinct is that that would be the right time to provide for such matters, in different terms from those that the amendment proposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened attentively to the Minister. I understand why specifying "all cases" would create difficulties with different Secretaries of State, and that was not my intention. I should like to make it clear that the word "reasonable" was not intended to deprive inspectors of being able to inspect boarding schools outside daylight hours. I understand the need for them to be able to do that, but I thought that my example made the more practical point that it would be better if an inspection were carried out when the boarding school was in full operation. I trust that the inspectors will use the reasonableness that they will be required to exercise to ensure that they do not carry out inspections when the school might reasonably expect to perform extensive maintenance. That might leave loose wires hanging, or other hazards that would give the inspectors good cause for concern if the children were running round at the same time. However, the Minister stressed that he would expect inspectors to exercise reasonableness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Another practical example would be an inspection just after an unexpected serious problem, such as a major fire or a power cut, has hit a school. I am not slurring anyone, but a slightly vindictive inspector could insist on performing an inspection in such a situation. The inspector would inevitably find things seriously awry, and it would be wrong if such circumstances could be used against an otherwise well run school. However, I, too, accept the Minister's point that inspectors are required to behave reasonably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that example. Of course, that situation arises even with Ofsted inspections. Despite the best will in the world, a school can be beset by an unfortunate incident such as a fire or a flood, which puts the establishment under enormous strain when it is under the scrutiny of the Ofsted inspectors. We shall have to take it on trust that the National Care Standards Commission inspectors will be reasonable and take account of any exceptional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 627</span>
circumstances into which they might inadvertently walk.<br><br>
The Minister's counter-argument to amendment No. 484 highlighted the key question of checks and balances. Parents are often asked to provide written consent to the school. Most recently, I signed my daughter's consent form for the meningitis C vaccine. It is not unusual for consent to be requested for medical purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend gives me the opportunity to clarify one point for the Minister. At both the schools that I attended, it was a condition of being sent to the school—I understood that it was the standard procedure everywhere—that one's nominated guardian had the full legal powers of the parent, if one's parents lived abroad. There was no question of the school not having immediate access to someone who could speak on the parents' behalf.</span></p>
<p>3.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for the clarification of his position. It certainly puts the checks and balances of his educational experience into context. We should hate to give the Committee the impression that his days at boarding school were anything other than the happiest of his life.<br><br>
I would like to accept the Minister's suggestion that he will consider the right balance to strike between the child's rights and those of the parents. A child who faces the authority of a Government inspector or someone else from officialdom is more likely than not to agree to a request by the inspector. That is in the nature of children; they are brought up to respect authority. Therefore a balance must be struck.<br><br>
There is no guarantee that the inspectors who carry out the job will have any medical training or come from any medical discipline. Bruising underneath the skin can be a problem with some medical conditions, and it is therefore important that the inspectors understand what they may be dealing with. That was also part of the concern in our minds.<br><br>
I want to state for the record that there is no question of complacency on the Opposition Benches. I reassure the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who challenged us about that. It is a question of trying to get the balance right. I am reassured that the Minister is willing to consider the issue of checks and balances between parental responsibility and a child's rights. The situation is delicate, and we are concerned that the balance should not tip the wrong way. Lest it create a loophole, whereby an establishment where vulnerable people were subject to abuse might slip through the net, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, it is not possible procedurally to have a stand part debate on a part of the Bill. Therefore I want to take this opportunity to have a brief stand part debate on the first clause of part VII, concerning boarding schools and colleges.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister is aware of the intention on the part of boarding schools to volunteer national boarding standards to him. Clause 85 puts the stress on the need to
<br><blockquote><p>safeguard and promote the child's welfare.</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely the purpose for which the provisional national standards for boarding schools have been drawn up, with the assistance inter alia of Ofsted. In fact, 630 accredited boarding schools have contributed to a two-year consultation process on what should be a set of core national standards for boarding schools. It is interesting to pause for a second to consider the way in which that would help fulfil the objectives of the clause, because so much of the Bill is about establishing national care standards. This is an interesting example of a sector volunteering to the Government a set of national standards with the support of Government bodies.<br><br>
Several of the core standards proposed make a great deal of common sense, such as each boarder having one or more members of staff to whom he or she can turn for personal guidance. There are also practical points, such as the proposal that ill boarders should be checked regularly by a member of staff and be able to summon staff assistance readily and rapidly. All the schools are willing to subscribe to those practical standards.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister is aware of the initiative, but I want to record our support for the work. I hope that the Government will welcome it. It is an interesting example of another way to address the problem that we saw earlier in the Bill of a sector feeling that a set of standards is being imposed on it, albeit with a controversial consultation process. Conversely, this is an example of a sector volunteering a set of standards with considerable input from Government bodies, social services, local government and so on. To me, that is an interesting counter—example of how a set of national standards can be obtained in a consensual manner. I commend it to the Minister.</span></p>

BOARDING SCHOOLS: NATIONAL MINIMUM STANDARDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 422, in page 57, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() Before issuing a statement, or an amended statement which in the opinion of the Secretary of State effects a substantial change in the standards, the Secretary of State shall consult any persons he considers appropriate.'.</p></blockquote>
As members of the Committee will be aware, the amendment is the result of a commitment that we gave earlier in our proceedings to ensure consultation on national minimum standards in relation to part III and part VII services, as well as part II services. Part II already has a requirement in clause 22(3). In relation to part III services, I accepted amendment No. 33, tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, which would require the appropriate Minister to undertake the necessary consultation. The amendment introduces a similar requirement in relation to part VII services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following my earlier remarks about the minimum standards being volunteered to the Government by boarding schools, I would like to say that I am pleased that the consultation is to be integrated into the clause. It would obviously be important to schools that set themselves core standards to receive fresh directions from central Government. It would help them to be consulted. I think that that links closely to the kind of consultative process that has taken place with Government bodies and local government representation. It would make logical sense for those bodies to be consulted in the way in which the amendment would facilitate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should perhaps respond to a point made by the hon. Lady in relation to a slightly earlier amendment, but it applies with equal force to this amendment. The development of some model standards by the Boarding Schools Association provides a good basis on which we might proceed with the new set of national minimum standards. We are actively considering that. We expect to consult on standards in the autumn. That will provide an opportunity for her and others to become involved.<br><br>
We do not require independent schools and other boarding schools that provide the service to register with the National Care Standards Commission. There is a slight difference between how the national minimum required standards will apply to them and how they will apply to other regulated services. There will not be a direct connection between the standards and any regulations. To that extent, they will be more free-standing, and not tied directly to any specific regulations. Those agencies, schools and colleges will not have to register with the commission.<br><br>
However, there will be ample opportunity for the concerns of the Boarding Schools Association and others to be taken into account. Indeed, the provisions go slightly wider than traditional boarding schools by including residential special schools and further education colleges, which also provide boarding. It is important that all those providers have an opportunity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
to be involved with the consultation, and we shall ensure that that happens.</span></p>

SCHEMES FOR THE TRANSFER OF STAFF</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>'who have been given appropriate notice of a proposal to apply such a scheme to them and have consented to be included within it'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 488, in Clause 94, page 60, line 20, leave out from 'employer' to end of line 22 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'shall remain in full force and effect'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 487 seeks to secure for the employee the right to give his consent for a transfer. Amendment No. 488 would protect the contractual rights of someone who does not want to be transferred. That may be dealt with in another way under employment law, but the Bill seems to leave the wishes and rights of the employee out of the situation. It is therefore important to speak up for employees. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, amendment No. 487 would require that in all the staff transfers that are to be made under the Bill, staff must be given appropriate notice and could be transferred only with their consent.<br><br>
Amendment No. 488 would allow an employee's contract of employment to continue with his old employer if he or she objected to the transfer. The hon. Lady is trying to preserve the employment rights of the workers concerned. She is welcome to do that; perhaps she and her party should do it more often. However, the amendment involves a difficulty, as I shall explain.<br><br>
The functions of local authorities in relation to inspecting children's homes and care homes are being transferred to the National Care Standards Commission. The amendment would have the effect of none the less requiring the employer to continue with an employment contract that it would not then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
legally be able to discharge, because its functions would have transferred to the National Care Standards Commission. That would be a difficult situation for the local authority to find itself in, and we cannot therefore accept the amendment.<br><br>
On amendment No. 487, the hon. Lady may be labouring under a misunderstanding about the nature of the employment protection regulations in TUPE. Staff transfers are a matter of great concern to many people, and I shall take this opportunity to say a little about how they will affect those workers. All staff transfers under the Bill will reflect the TUPE principle that staff should be transferred on their existing terms and conditions. None of the important reforms in the Bill will be a success unless we continue to engage the knowledge, skills and experience of the staff who currently undertake the work.<br><br>
All staff who may transfer to the National Care Standards Commission, the Welsh Assembly, the General Social Care Council or Ofsted will have the right to choose whether to do so. We intend to work closely with the relevant trade unions and representative bodies, as well as with local authorities and others, in developing the detail of those transfers. Indeed, work has already begun in those areas.<br><br>
I must make it clear to the hon. Lady that all transfers will be entirely voluntary. We cannot force staff to transfer, nor would we ever want to. The success of the new regulatory authorities and bodies to be established under the Bill will depend to a large extent on their staff. There would be no point in trying to force staff to transfer. That would be totally counterproductive. I hope that she will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 487. As I said earlier, I have some concerns about amendment No. 488, which I have addressed, and I hope that she will not press it to a vote.<br><br>
3.30 pm<br><br>
In general terms, it is our intention to proceed as though the TUPE regulations applied. In so doing we are complying with Cabinet Office guidance that was issued in January on this matter. We need a specific statutory provision in the Bill, because it is our understanding that there would otherwise be no arrangements for the transfer of staff, as TUPE would not apply. That position has arisen because of some contradictory jurisprudence that has emerged from the European Court relating to the correct interpretation to be placed on when and in what circumstances the TUPE regulations apply. We cannot leave this to chance. We have made specific provision in the Bill, and I hope that I have reassured the hon. Lady that there will be no question of people being dragooned, one way or another, into working in an environment in which they had no intention of working.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that all transfers would be voluntary, which addresses the spirit of what the amendment was designed to achieve. I imagine that he means that the offer of an opportunity to transfer would be made to staff in writing, and that the response to that would amount to a consent. I am,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
therefore, reasonably comfortable about withdrawing the amendment, because its purpose would be achieved by the voluntary nature of the transfers.<br><br>
I think that the Minister understood what amendment No. 488 was designed to achieve. It reflects some of the concerns expressed by some Government Members, who asked questions earlier in our deliberations about how permanent the posts would be for staff transferring to different bodies. Many people have anxieties about being moved from working under good contractual terms on to short contracts, which are a feature of the modern employment market.<br><br>
My concern was that people faced with the option of making a transfer, who decided, for whatever reason, that they did not want to take it, might suddenly find that they had lost the protection of their old contractual terms if they wished, for example, to work out a notice period that had been set in the original contract. The aim of amendment No. 488 was to try to ensure that an employee who chose not to transfer would not suddenly be without the protection that had previously been afforded.<br><br>
Single status is currently being implemented in my constituency, and employees offered changes to their employment status are concerned about the loss of their original contract and about the kind of protection that they would have if they took the step into a job that was differently defined. The amendment was designed to provide protection for those who choose not to transfer. However, the Minister seems satisfied that, although there have been problems relating to jurisprudence and TUPE, adequate protection can be afforded. He is a lawyer and I am not, so I shall have to be assured that there is adequate legal protection, although I was pleased to hear about the voluntary element in the transfers. That is the point that we were looking for, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

difference to the meaning of the subsection, and the case has not been made for accepting them. The word "provision" is simply an alternative to "section", and it is used to make the drafting clearer. Were we to accept the amendments, the word "section" would appear three times in two lines, and the question of which section was being referred to would be ambiguous.<br><br>
I have to say that these are characteristically unhelpful amendments from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. [<i>Interruption.</i>] That might be unkind, but I am trying to choose my words carefully.

Are amendments tabled in respect of the children's commissioner in Wales in order and selectable? In particular, I draw attention to amendment No. 463, on page 736 of the amendment paper, which appears to give either the Secretary of State or the Assembly the power to amend primary legislation or other instruments. That could extend the role of the commissioner substantially beyond the scope of the Bill, and earlier amendments were ruled out of order because they fell outside the Bill's scope. Although I hope that the amendment is in order, the form that it takes perplexes me.</span></p>

ORDERS AND REGULATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 491, in page 61, line 12, leave out from 'State' to 'shall' in line 13.<br><br>
You would rightly call me to order, Mr. Illsley, if I were to return to the debate that we had at the beginning of our proceedings, but the amendment addresses an issue that runs throughout the Bill.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 634</span>
Effectively, it is not a real Bill, but a framework for regulations. One of the few things that makes it tolerable in parliamentary terms is clause 97. Subsection (3) states that instruments have to be
<br><blockquote><p>subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</p></blockquote>
Parliament thus at least gets a look-in. Bearing in mind the huge scope of the Bill, that is extremely important.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to plug a parliamentary hole in subsection (3) by deleting the words
<br><blockquote><p>except an instrument containing an order under section 101.</p></blockquote>
Clause 101 is a brief clause that deals with the enactment of the Bill; specifically, the point at which it comes into force. Unusually—thinking back to other Committees on which I have served—it allows it to come into force in bits, rather than in its entirety. That is not unreasonable, given the Bill's complexity and scope. However, if the amendment is not accepted, all the different bits can be enacted separately—and some are highly complicated and cover a whole range of activities—without, as far as I can see, either House of Parliament having any chance to look at the relevant regulations.<br><br>
I have no doubt that the Minister will tell me that the situation is covered in some complicated way. However, it boils down to a simple question. Will the Secretary of State of the day be allowed to introduce chunks of regulation as each bit of the Bill is enacted without getting those individual regulations checked in Parliament? That gives rise to a second question. If the Minister is going to tell me that the answer to that question is, "No, of course not"—he is a reasonable chap, so I am sure that he is preparing to say that—what is the reason for those words in subsection (3)? Why is it necessary to exempt an instrument containing an order under clause 101?<br><br>
I should like to make a wider observation. The most complicated piece of legislation that I can remember considering in Committee is the Family Law Bill, which was enacted in 1996. One of its key issues was how long it would be before it was enacted. Eventually, when the Government whom the Minister serves were elected, they decided not to enact the bulk of it, and enacted only the last part.<br><br>
In parallel with the Family Law Bill, we are faced with hugely complicated matters involving large amounts of consultation. I cannot imagine why any Minister—let alone one who is so reasonable—would want to enact the various sets of regulations without returning them to Parliament once this purely skeletal Bill turns into a real legislative measure, as it will do only at the point at which the regulations are produced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he presented his argument. However, it is bizarre to found that argument on the amendment. We are simply providing, in exactly the same way in which Parliament has always done, procedures for commencement orders to be made. We are following that precedent; commencement orders are usually made in this way. The House has agreed that the Bill's provisions should already have commenced by the time that it has received Royal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 635</span>
Assent. This is a question of timing. In my experience, it would be unprecedented to debate an instrument that commences an Act. I could research the question of whether any such orders have been made, although I am not sure that my officials would welcome that.<br><br>
We are doing nothing out of the ordinary in specifying how the Act is to be brought into effect. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would subject the commencement order to annulment by either House. It could be a probing amendment to obtain an explanation from the Government as to how we intend to introduce the wider regulations and bring them into effect, but I thought that I had been able to reassure hon. Members on that earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's characteristically courteous response. However, he tempts me to make a point that I almost made earlier, when the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made his comments about explanatory notes for new clauses, which I supported. The reason why I am putting forward an almost unprecedented argument is that this is an almost unprecedented Bill.<br><br>
I cannot remember serving on a Bill for which so many Government new clauses popped up. That is why it is not unreasonable for people to call for explanatory notes on new clauses. The Minister rightly said that to do so would have been almost unprecedented. However, if there are huge numbers of them, and some of them are complicated, they should have explanatory notes.<br><br>
To the best of my knowledge—and I should be delighted if the Minister put me right on this point—there has never been a Bill of this kind. It introduces a gigantic skeleton of regulations, and has almost no content of its own. The Minister rightly said that it would be ridiculous to adopt a separate procedure to commence an ordinary Act of Parliament that was simply concerned with a new law. I mentioned the example of the Family Law Act 1996. However, there must be common ground on both sides of the House—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please bring his remarks to a close? I must remind him that he is making an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am terribly sorry. I thought that the Minister had sat down. I had no idea that I was making an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I, too, thought that the Minister had sat down; I did not realise either. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will now bring his remarks to a conclusion. He can speak again after the Minister has finished, should he so wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In summary, the Bill is a framework for regulation as no other major Bill of such complexity that I have seen. Given that there could be a considerable interval before parts of the Bill come into force—some of those requiring a great deal of complicated consultation may be years rather than months away from taking effect—it is reasonable that Parliament should be revisited.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to gather my breath and reassemble
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
my arguments. I do not quite know where to begin in responding to his remarks.<br><br>
I disagree profoundly with the hon. Gentleman's description of the Bill as an empty box. Substantial new provisions are spelt out very clearly in it. For example, we have just discussed provisions relating to the protection of vulnerable adults and the establishment of the new list. The Bill also contains provisions about the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission, the General Social Care Council and the Care Council for Wales. Those are substantial provisions.<br><br>
I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that this is a Bill without precedent in the long annals of parliamentary history. I do not agree with him on that. Even if he were right, I do not see how requiring the commencement order to be made subject to the negative procedure would improve parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations, about which he and his hon. Friends are concerned. It would not add to the improvement of the scrutiny in any way, shape or form. I have tried to make it clear to him that where the Bill gives the Secretary of State new powers to make regulations, they will be implemented in a way that fully involves all Members who take an interest in those subjects. We are obliged to consult on the development of the national standards and we have made it clear that we shall consult in the normal way on the way in which the regulations are presented. If the hon. Gentleman wants to take part in that consultation, he and his hon. Friends will be welcome to do so. There is no substance to the argument that we are trying to rush through a van load of regulations at the dead of night that he and his hon. Friends will discover when they wake up the following morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the commentary from outside organisations on the way in which we are enacting the Bill? The School of Public Policy's constitution unit made the observation that allowing Bills
<br><blockquote><p>into the legislative programme which are insufficiently prepared—</p></blockquote>
we must assume that when so many new clauses are being introduced—is one of the reasons for the logjam at this stage of the parliamentary year and one of the reasons why organisations that are directly affected by the implementation of the Bill become ever more confused about when the regulatory aspects are likely to affect them. All that they want to know is how and when they will be affected. One of the difficulties of a flexible framework is that having so much regulation within it creates confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we do not want to create confusion, which is why we have tried to spell out clearly the implementation arrangements that we have in mind. We have done that with the establishment of the National Care Standards Commission and we have tried to indicate when and where the national minimum standards will be published and take effect. Of course there is concern about the law-making process, but nothing in the Bill should give rise to concern and I do not accept the hon. Lady's argument.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
We have tried to introduce the provision openly and transparently and have ensured the unprecedented involvement of people outside in developing some of the minimum standards. I do not accept the hon. Lady's criticism. We are taking new regulatory powers because they are necessary and they will be subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny. We are not taking short cuts with the parliamentary process. As I said to the hon. Member for Canterbury, who tabled the amendments, we have tried to spell out in the Committee the time scale for introducing the regulations and developing the national minimum standards. If it would help the hon. Gentleman, I am prepared to write to him setting out that time scale so that he understands it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I owe the Minister an apology because I had no idea that I was intervening. I thought that he had sat down.<br><br>
I want to return to a couple of the Minister's comments. He knows that all parties here support most of the ideas behind the Bill. It includes some important provisions and I am not suggesting that it is a completely empty box. However, it is a skeleton—a powerful and important skeleton—on which an enormous amount of regulatory flesh will be hung.<br><br>
I want to be clear about what the Minister said, so perhaps he will answer one simple question? When the first regulations are introduced in each area, and if some are introduced two or three years hence—perhaps after the election—will it be necessary for the Minister to have any parliamentary scrutiny of those regulations? The one thing that the Bill does not and cannot contain is its own regulations. Will the first set of regulations have to be discussed by the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that of course they will. We do not have a power to make regulations that bypasses Parliament. There is nothing in the Bill to preclude the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends from proposing a motion praying against any of the regulations.<br><br>
We are not taking any short cuts with the normal parliamentary process for approving regulations. We are not taking powers to make regulations on the say so of the Secretary of State. That would not be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain the wording of the clause? Why does it read
<br><blockquote><p>except an instrument containing an order containing an order under section 101</p></blockquote>
instead of simply saying "except an instrument implementing section 101"? Why does it use the word "containing"? That could apply to any amount of regulatory material, as long as it is implementing something new.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks about the commencement orders. I have made it clear that they would be brought into effect when the Secretary of State decides. Commencement orders are always dealt with in that way, so we are not taking any exceptional powers. We are acting in the usual way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
I would remind the hon. Gentleman that, when the Bill, having been passed by the House, becomes law, the commencement orders will bring into effect only provisions that Parliament has approved, after extensive debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have exhausted the matter, but I still do not see why the clause is worded in that way, as opposed to the way that I suggested. Given the Minister's majority and his powers of persuasion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 467, in page 61, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'In subsection (2) and this subsection, references to the Secretary of State include the Secretary of State and the Assembly acting jointly'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 468 to 472.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our previous debate, the hon. Member for Canterbury complained about the fact that the Government had tabled so many amendments. We cannot win: when we listen to hon. Members' concerns and table amendments, we are criticised.<br><br>
No one can ever say that the original draft of a Bill represents a perfect finished product; we are here to debate it. Some of our amendments, including this group, are technical amendments, but we have also accepted some Opposition amendments when we felt that they were sensible and prudent. What we are trying to do together—if that is not too consensual—is improve the Bill. These amendments will do that.<br><br>
Essentially, the amendments are technical. Amendments Nos. 467 and 470 will enable the Secretary of State and the Assembly to act jointly to exercise their functions under the Bill, where they have both agreed to do so. Amendment No. 470 changes the definition of an "appropriate Minister". Amendment No. 467 is consequential to that and provides that, where a function is exercised jointly, the relevant parliamentary scrutiny procedures will apply.<br><br>
Amendment No. 468 ensures that clause 97(4), which relates to regulatory powers, will also apply in cases in which powers are conferred on the appropriate Minister, rather than explicitly on the Secretary of State or the Assembly. Amendment No. 472 corrects the reference to regulations in clause 100, to ensure that it does not apply if specific reference has been made to the Secretary of State or the Assembly.<br><br>
Amendment No. 469 confers powers on the Secretary of State to commence the provisions relating to Scotland and Northern Ireland, by making the necessary alteration to the definition of "appropriate Minister". Amendment No. 471 is a technical amendment and removes the unnecessary and potentially confusing word "only" from the interpretation of regulations, as set out in clause 100.</span></p>
