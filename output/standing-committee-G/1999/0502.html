<div class='page-header'><h1>Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill</h1></div>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin, it may help the Committee if I say a few words about proceedings at the previous sitting. During the speech on clause 36 by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), I was persuaded that it would be appropriate to amend my provisional list of the selection of amendments by transferring a group of amendments headed by amendment No. 5 from its position under clause 42 to clause 37 where it was discussed together with the debate on clause stand part. At that time, the hon. Member was told that, although the debate on the amendments had been advanced, he could call amendment No. 5 for a formal decision when it was reached on the amendment paper.<br><br>
Since then, I have determined that the Committee's decision to allow clauses 36, 37 and 38 to stand part of the Bill means that it would be inappropriate for me to invite the hon. Gentleman to move his amendment which, if made, would run counter to the earlier decisions. Our proceedings in Committee are complex and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his understanding.<br><br>
It may also help hon. Members to know that the provisional list we shall be using today is the third revised list, copies of which are available.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 41</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PRE-SENTENCE DRUG TESTING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 171, in page 26, line 5, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>'specified Class A'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 41 provides for the court, if necessary, to order an offender to provide a sample for drug testing when the court is considering passing a community sentence and the offender is aged 18 or over. This will assist the court in assessing cases, particularly those where a test result is not available from an early stage in the criminal justice system process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish if I may. I know we have had a break, but this is a little much even for the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. In introducing new drug testing requirements and orders, the court must be able to satisfy itself in relation to each case that the offender before it is dependent on, or has a propensity to use drugs. Clause 41 also provides for the enforcement of this order where an offender fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply—and the court may impose a penalty of a level 4 fine.<br><br>
Amendment No. 171 seeks simply to clarify the position in relation to the pre-sentence drug test that a court can order to assist in considering whether to pass a community sentence. It seeks to make it clear that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
relates to specified class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, as is the case at the other stages in the criminal justice system such as arrest on charge or under probation service supervision where drug testing is being introduced. We have not applied any different criteria in relation to this clause and the amendment clarifies that.<br><br>
The reason for that—the hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to make his speech—is that heroin and crack cocaine are drugs which research shows are most clearly linked to the commission of crime. At least a third of all acquisitive crime is committed in order to buy heroin and or crack cocaine.<br><br>
The Secretary of State can amend the specified drugs if research shows a similar link between other drugs and crime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister shares my surprise that we do not, apparently, have any Liberal Democrat Members on this Committee despite their much-vaunted interest in the drugs issue. I am sure that on that point at least the Minister and I will be united. On this amendment, however, does he agree that there is well-documented evidence already linking the commission of crime and the consumption of many other drugs—not merely heroin and crack cocaine. I agree with him, of course, that the research suggests that those are particularly addictive drugs. All the scientific evidence and all our human experience in the court tends to confirm that consumption of those drugs leads to a particular temptation to commit crime because of the very high addictive quality of the drugs and, therefore, the need for constant repetition of a fix. Criminals then become so intense in their craving for those drugs that they will do almost anything—including committing very serious crimes—to raise funds to purchase the next fix. However, even though those are the most addictive drugs, does the Minister agree that there is considerable evidence from many criminologists, scientists and many of those who have studied the pattern of crime committed by drug-users, linking many other drugs to the commission of crimes?<br><br>
Although he said that his amendment is simply a clarification, I am surprised that he said that other drugs could be included at a later stage only if further evidence comes to light. Surely the evidence is already there. I invite the Minister to write to members of the Committee to indicate precisely the pieces of evidence that have led him and his advisers to conclude that it is only heroin and crack cocaine which are to be included. If we were to see all the research that the Home Office has, we might see all the links to other drugs. Perhaps it would enable other amendments to be tabled at a later stage, either in another place or on Report. It might even enable us to persuade the Government to table amendments to include drugs other than heroin and crack cocaine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly write to the hon. Gentleman and explain to him in more detail why we have decided that it would be right to limit the application of this clause to class A drugs. I will point out to him the specific pieces of research that have led us to that conclusion. We know that the evidence for establishing links between class A drugs and crime is much more advanced than is the case with other drugs.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
Our view is that we should bring forward provisions on the basis of best evidence. Best evidence suggests that it is right to make the link with class A drugs at this stage because that is the clearest of links. We recognise, however, that this is an evolving state of affairs and that new drugs come on to the scene. We would not have anticipated, 20-odd years ago, that crack cocaine would have made the impact that it has on crime and criminality. In order to ensure that we are better able to address this issue in the future, there is specific provision for the Secretary of State to make the necessary orders if satisfied that research shows a similar link between other drugs and crime. However, that is not the state of the evidence at the moment and I will give the hon. Member for Surrey Heath chapter and verse as to why we have come to that conclusion.<br><br>
I noticed, as no doubt did the whole Committee, the paucity of attendance of all Opposition Members. There is not a single Liberal Democrat Member present. However, with her customary courtesy, the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) has sent her apologies through my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall). It is only fair to point out that no discourtesy was intended to you, Mr. Maxton, or to the Committee. Some might say that it is lucky that we are not sitting on Thursday, because there may have been even fewer hon. Members present.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
COMMUNITY SENTENCES: DRUG ABSTINENCE REQUIREMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause will introduce new drug abstinence requirements that the courts may add to probation orders. That is in line with the tough action that we are taking against those who commit crime to feed a drug habit. The new powers will complement the drug abstinence orders and will be used where the court has decided to impose a community sentence and will further require the offender to abstain from drug misuse.<br><br>
The court will be required to add such a requirement to a community sentence where the offender is aged 18 or over, is convicted of a trigger offence and is, in the court's opinion, dependent on or has a propensity to misuse specified class A drugs. In other cases, the court will have the discretion to include a drug abstinence requirement if it believes that the misuse of a specified class A drug caused or contributed to the offence. The court may not add a drug abstinence requirement if a drug testing and treatment order or a drug abstinence order has been issued, or if a community rehabilitation order that includes any drug requirement has been issued. In such cases, a drug abstinence requirement would clearly be superfluous, because the matter had already been handled in another way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
Testing is seen as an integral part of monitoring the requirement. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have the power to issue guidance on the frequency of sample provision by the offender and may make rules for regulating the provision of samples.<br><br>
Drug abstinence requirements will also be piloted, and the clause provides that a court may issue such a requirement only in areas notified by the Secretary of State as having arrangements in place for its implementation. On that basis, I urge the Committee to support clause 42.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, I should inform the Committee, in view of the Minister's remarks about our not sitting on Thursday, that we will sit on Thursday unless the Committee decides otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for that reassurance. Will the Minister clarify the piloting that he has mentioned? It was suggested that
<br><blockquote><p>initial piloting in three areas would result in 3,500 offenders being made subject to the drug abstinence requirement.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 561W.]</p></blockquote>
At least, that is what the Government had in mind. Will the Minister confirm that that is still the case?<br><br>
It seems to me that we have already covered quite a lot of ground in relation to the order during previous debates on amendments to the clause. I do not think that much purpose will be served by going over that ground again, but I would be grateful for the Minister's answer to the question about piloting and the numbers involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not envisage more extensive piloting than that outlined at our previous sitting. I will write to the hon. Gentleman about whether we have decided that the orders should be piloted in the same areas as the other orders. Evidence might best be gathered by using another area, so that we can make comparisons. I do not think that a final decision has been made, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman when it has so that he has an idea of the areas and numbers that we are considering.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
COMMUNITY SENTENCES: CURFEW REQUIREMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Currently, the courts have the power to impose a curfew order on an offender. The clause will extend that power by providing for community rehabilitation orders to include a curfew requirement. In one sense, the power is not completely new: it merely provides a different means to the same end and allows the court, if it so chooses, to impose community rehabilitation and curfew in the same order.<br><br>
As with a free-standing curfew order, the court must try to ensure that the curfew requirement does not conflict with the offender's education, work or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
religious beliefs, and that a responsible officer is appointed to monitor compliance with the terms of the requirement. The Secretary of State must notify the court that arrangements for monitoring the curfew are currently available in the area where the curfew address is situated. That will enable the provisions to be piloted.<br><br>
The court that imposes the order is also required to obtain and consider information about the curfew address, which must include information about the attitude of other people likely to be affected by the offender's enforced presence there. It is possible to envisage circumstances in which the presence of a particular person would not be welcomed by other residents in the house. As those of us who have practised in the criminal courts know, it is not unknown to encounter objections to conditions of residence and curfew from people who might, ostensibly, seem only too happy to have the offender there, but turn out not to be.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
It is important that the court be fully informed of the attitude of other people likely to be affected by the offender's enforced presence, to ensure that they find it acceptable, before the court imposes a curfew requirement.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee, which is considerably improved by the presence of the hon. Member for Taunton—her apologies have been conveyed to the Committee, but her absence provoked some comment from the less charitable among us, but we are all glad that she is here—will support clause 43.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome the hon. Member for Taunton. I count myself, with the Minister, among the less charitable who commented earlier.<br><br>
Clause 43 worries us only in relation to the requirements that it imposes on courts to obtain and consider information about the place where the offender will be required to remain. The Minister is right to say that it is vital that information should be given to the court about the attitude of other people in the area. We recognise that the Minister is accurate to refer to public anxiety about the matter, which has been debated extensively when the matter of curfews has arisen in the past.<br><br>
It is important that the Minister reflect on the fact that that will be an issue for local people. To some extent, we are prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt about whether the provisions will work especially well in practice. We have expressed anxiety about them in the past. Later, in debating other clauses, we shall return to other issues that relate to the use of electronic tagging. At this stage, we are prepared to say that we welcome the fact that the Government recognise the anxieties expressed about people who live in an area where offenders may be subject to a curfew.<br><br>
The courts should always have information about the views of local people. What guidance will be given to benches of magistrates on how they are supposed to acquire such information? Will doing so simply involve a police officer from the area reporting his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
discussions with local residents, for example? It would be helpful to have some reassurance from the Minister on how it is proposed to do that, but at this stage we are prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the hon. Gentleman's points, and will take them into account in developing our thinking on the matter. However, the main thrust of the clause relates to the requirement that the court obtain and consider information about the curfew address. That is primarily geared towards considering the attitudes of people living in the same home as the person likely to be curfewed there. It is possible to interpret the provision as impacting on neighbours and people on the street in the immediate locality, and I would not rule that out. However, I would not like to mislead the Committee. The primary purpose of the provision is to ensure that the court is satisfied by the address given by the person on whom the curfew is imposed. That person may be staying with their mum or with a partner who may be an estranged partner, umwilling to continue to cohabit, but whose name and address have been given as the curfew address. That has happened in the past. When people in extremis need to give an address, they tend to give all sorts of information to the court. The provision requires the court to satisfy itself not only that an address exists, but that it is an address at which the person concerned will be welcome.<br><br>
The provision is primarily aimed, therefore, at a person or persons living at a particular address; it is not aimed at the wider concerns of those who live in the same locality as that address, although those are concerns that I share. Those concerns would be better addressed with regard to risk assessment and public protection. However, I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I will take advice on the extent to which it would be proper for the court to consider those wider issues, and how it might do so.</span></p>

Clause 44</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
COMMUNITY SENTENCES: EXCLUSION REQUIREMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is similar to the previous one, except that it allows a court to include an exclusion requirement rather than a curfew requirement in a community rehabilitation order or in a community punishment and rehabilitation order. Like the curfew requirement power, it does little more than provide an alternative and somewhat simpler route to imposing exclusion where it has already been decided to impose a community rehabilitation order. That will give the courts a sensible flexibility and scope as to how they use their powers.<br><br>
The exclusion requirement differs from the curfew requirement in many of the same ways that curfew and exclusion orders differ from each other, and for the same reasons. For example, the period for which an exclusion requirement can be imposed is longer than that for a curfew requirement, owing to the greater intrusion of a curfew into an offender's personal life. An offender can be excluded from an "area" as well as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
a "place". That means, for example, that an offender can be excluded from premises and their grounds, as well as from specific buildings. That power serves the same purposes as the exclusion order. It provides greater scope in sentencing, is a valuable tool in the fight against crime and criminal behaviour, demonstrates that community sentencing is not something to be taken lightly, and serves further to protect the public—especially certain vulnerable groups. Those involved in the issue of domestic violence see a great deal of scope in exclusion orders, as do other victim groups The clause rounds out the availability of the powers of exclusion and curfew to the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, while we recognise that there may be considerable benefits to be gained if the power is used effectively, we have some concerns. A recent briefing that I have received from the Association of Chief Officers of Probation reinforces those concerns. I do not know whether the Minister has given thought to that association's belief that measures are needed to strengthen the law applying to breach. That association is not the only body to express concern about the fact that the orders that we have been discussing are, as the Government plan them, free standing.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify that such orders could not be imposed by a court after a breach? In other words, if someone were subject to a curfew order and went back to court for a breach of that order, he could not be given an exclusion order. It might be wise for the Government to consider that such matters do not have to be free standing, but that there could be—as ACOP put it—a penalty for every breach. It described the position succinctly in its briefing and stated that every offender returning to court for a breach should receive a penalty that reflects the court's disapproval, the need to protect the public and the likely eventual success of the order in reducing crime. ACOP also pointed out that courts need to have the full range of disposals, so that they can deal appropriately with all sorts of breached offenders.<br><br>
Given that it became apparent in a parliamentary answer that a large number of offenders had breached curfews, will the Minister at least consider with officials and other bodies, including ACOP, whether there are further ways to strengthen the Bill? It is not that we are against the powers of exclusion orders, but that it might be possible to extend their use and the flexibility with which the courts can use such powers. I hope that the Minister is willing do that. We want the courts to have a full range of powers. We do not want them to regard such powers as purely free standing, particularly in the case of breach proceedings. They should have the flexibility to use them in combination with each other and to use one as a punishment for breach of another, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I do not have that much sympathy with it. We are discussing people who are in breach and who have not shown due respect to such an order and the terms and conditions upon which the court's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
disposal was extended to them to enable them to be in the wider community. When they have breached that trust and confidence, the Bill provides for automatic imprisonment—not for a second chance, with a new order tagged on to it. That is not what it is about. When someone is in breach, he has shown a lack of respect for the court's order and it is optimistic to believe that he would show any more respect if he was given a new order that included exclusion or curfew. Such people have not shown themselves as being trustworthy, as a result of which clause 46 provides for them to go to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's argument. I am sure that our experience in the courts leads us to realise that there are occasions when, after a breach, a defending advocate will succeed in persuading a magistrates bench to say, "Yes, there was a breach, but perhaps not of the most serious nature and it does not necessarily have to result in immediate custody." That may happen in the minority of cases, but given that ACOP is asking for greater flexibility, will the Minister at least consider whether it has a point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always interested in the views of the association. We are not persuaded, however, that it has a point. Like the hon. Gentleman, I have some experience of such pleas before magistrates at the instigation of lay clients. They are often far from well founded and there is considerable surprise if they manage to commend themselves to a susceptible bench. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has persuaded such a bench to extend the privilege of liberty to an offender who had breached his trust, only to find that he was back in court again within weeks having re-offended The whole thrust of the Bill is to prevent that from happening.<br><br>
The important aspect of clause 46 is that it will reduce the volume of crime. All too often benches do not take breaches seriously enough and are susceptible to advocates' blandishments and the excuses put forward by offenders. That is why I am unable to accept the hon. Gentleman's invitation to reflect on the issue in the light of the representations that he has received.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I ought to point out that the home detention curfew has a success rate in excess of 90 per cent. Therefore, I do not accept the argument that large numbers go on to breach. I hear and understand what the hon. Gentleman says and the basis upon which he says it, but on this occasion I cannot give him any hope that it will influence or cause a change of heart on our part.</span></p>

MONITORING OF REQUIREMENTS IN COMMUNITY REHABILITATION ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is an important element of our efforts to employ technology wisely and usefully in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
the fight against crime, especially in this field of electronic monitoring. We are introducing curfew and exclusion requirements in community orders to increase the protection available to the public. They mean that an offender who is subject to a community sentence can, in addition, be required to be at a certain place at certain times or to stay away from certain places. Modern technology now allows us to monitor this sort of requirement much more effectively than hitherto. We therefore believe that it is essential to make electronic monitoring available to help ensure proper enforcement of these requirements. We also see great advantage in extending electronic monitoring to other requirements of community rehabilitation orders.<br><br>
By including clause 45 in the Bill, we should be able in due course to monitor and better enforce, for example, the attendance of an offender on a course or at a probation centre. It is important to recognise that there are gains to be made for better enforcement in this field. We hope at a later stage in the passage of the Bill, to consider how best to use electronic monitoring to strengthen enforcement for a range of orders.<br><br>
As with the electronic monitoring of exclusion orders, the equipment has to be installed at the place from which an offender is excluded before monitoring can be practicable. The clause therefore requires consent to be obtained before the monitoring requirement may be imposed, from anyone without whose consent monitoring would not be practicable. I go back to my earlier example of a householder who is the mother or partner of a person being monitored. If they own the home where the equipment is to be installed, they would have to give consent before such monitoring could be practically achieved.<br><br>
The clause enables us to ensure that we can also take into account a victim's concerns when these orders are imposed. In all cases, a court will be required to identify a person responsible for carrying out such monitoring and this person is likely to be the contractor for the relevant area, who will also respond appropriately to any breach and, where necessary, provide evidence of that breach to the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and the Committee will be aware that we have grave reservations about the way in which electronic tagging has been used. It was made clear on Second Reading that, from the point of view of the official Opposition—and, I would say, of most people—the Government have been guilty of seriously misleading the British people. The Home Secretary said to the House as recently as November 1999:
<br><blockquote><p>We have no plans or intention whatever to provide for electronic tagging to facilitate the early release of serious or sexual offenders. Let me make that clear, with a full stop—none whatever.</p></blockquote>
We now know from a parliamentary answer that between 28 January 1999 and 13 March 2000, just under 18,000 prisoners were released early on tags. I am sure that Labour Committee members would be seriously embarrassed if a press release were issued to their constituents saying what their laws had brought about. The offences for which those people had been convicted included the following: 43 of manslaughter; five of attempted murder; 2,258 of wounding; 2,207 of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
drug dealing, not simply possession or use; 21 of cruelty to children; 18 of sex offences; 1,697 of burglary; and 717 of robbery. How does that stack up against the Home Secretary's clear statement that
<br><blockquote><p>We have no plans or intention whatever to provide for electronic tagging to facilitate the early release of serious or sexual offenders.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 November 1999; Vol. 340, c. 27.]</p></blockquote>
By that statement, the Government betrayed the British people, and I do not use that word lightly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misdirecting himself. Clause 45 is not concerned with released prisoners. It is about offences subject to community rehabilitation orders—that is, offenders who are not sent to prison. I am not clear where the thrust of his argument is leading us. We are debating a measure that is designed to ensure that community sentences are that much more effective and can afford the public better protection. That is something that the Conservative Administration singularly failed to do. They did not take advantage of the development of new technology to strengthen community sentences. We are now doing so. What is his objection to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will be patient, he will see where my argument is leading. It is straightforward—because of the clear breach of the promise on the use of electronic tags generally, we do not have any faith in the Government's promises on tagging in this Bill. When there is such serious conflict over the facts—it has reluctantly been admitted how tags are in general being used under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998—we cannot place much faith in the way in which the Government now say that they will use electronic tags in this Bill. The British people will have serious worries.<br><br>
We are in favour of those who are convicted being rehabilitated if at all possible, but we want to hear a much clearer explanation from the Minister as to how all of the broken promises on a very recent Act have been shown up and how that will be avoided in relation to this Bill. Until we do, those who look at these proceedings in another place will not be confident of the Government's promises. Given what the Government said—in contrast with what they did in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 on electronic tagging—people are entitled to ask what they will do this time round. What sort of breaches will we see of the Government's promises this time? I appreciate that the Minister may want to go away and think about this, but we want to hear what extra safeguards will be built into the system, so that we do not get the same sort of broken promises over their use. I do not suggest for a moment that anyone should ring the Minister or Home Secretary before they decide to issue an electronic tag for serious offences, but we want some safeguards. We want to know that the public will be protected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman remind the Committee how many people violate the conditions accruing to an electronic tag? As he knows, remarkably few people do so. Would he not accept that the tag leads to a change in the circumstances and makes it a more productive rehabilitation than might have been thought at one stage?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is essential in any punishment to try to have an element of rehabilitation. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will also accept that figures from parliamentary answers unfortunately reveal that a number of offenders commit further crimes after being given an electronic tagging sentence and that in some of the most serious cases they were the same type of crimes for which the sentence was introduced. My argument, which I hope that the Minister will understand, is that if under the 1998 Act—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman makes general remarks about tagging at this stage of the Bill, I shall be reluctant to allow him to do so again on clause 50, which is a much more appropriate point for his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In light of your guidance, Mr. Maxton, I will not pursue the point. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) understands me. I shall reserve further remarks for clause 50.<br><br>
It is essential that we give the British public the reassurance that they want. We shall, as you say, Mr. Maxton, return to this issue on clause 50, but even so the public will want further reassurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All that I can say is that in view of your strictures to the hon. Gentleman, Mr. Maxton, I do not want to get drawn into a debate about the success or otherwise of HDC. It has been demonstrated that in more than 90 per cent. of cases HDC has proved successful by any criteria. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues did not oppose electronic tagging in the Lobby because of its potential for ensuring that the public are better protected. The Select Committee on Home Affairs of which the hon. Gentleman was a member, actively recommended—as he did—and canvassed, its use. He cannot now pretend that this is some sort of soft option that is putting the British public at risk, when it has been demonstrated that electronic tagging is an aid not only to rehabilitation but to public protection and to restoring some order to the often chaotic and therefore dangerously crime-prone lives of those who are subject to its disciplines.<br><br>
That is why I do not accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Were we to go down the road that he suggests and remove clause 45, neither the curfew nor the exclusion requirements in clauses 43 and 44 could be monitored electronically, nor could any other requirement of a court's order. Without clause 45, exclusion imposed as a free-standing order could be monitored electronically, but if it imposed a condition of another community order it could not be. The same inconsistency would apply with curfew orders and conditions. That is especially important as curfew orders supported by electronic monitoring have recently been made available nationally, again after successful trials.<br><br>
We are not proposing anything that would not be subject to some piloting or anything that is not already evidence based and proven to be successful. For those reason, I assure members of the Committee that there is no hidden agenda; there is no intention of avoiding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
the necessity for those subject to both the orders of the courts and its trust and confidence to comply with them. Indeed, there is a determination to ensure the application of the range of technology that is becoming available, better to enforce the orders of the courts and protect the public. For those reasons, commend clause 45 to the Committee.</span></p>

<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will disapply the statutory warning scheme to failed drug tests undertaken as a requirement of a drug abstinence order or a drug abstinence condition of another community order. The Government's position is clear. The new national standards for the supervision of offenders in the community require that breach proceedings be initiated no later than a second unacceptable failure to comply with a community sentence. If offenders are not returned to court immediately after a first failure to comply, a final warning letter must be sent to the offender explaining the consequences of a further unacceptable failure. The introduction of a statutory warning and the duty to return an offender to court on the second unacceptable failure will reinforce the new national standard. Supervising officers will decide in the first instance what is an unacceptable failure. The offender will have every opportunity to explain his behaviour and, where necessary, to provide evidence such as medical certificates, appointment cards, details of a family crisis and so on. Judgments about whether failures to comply are acceptable are made on an individual case-by-case basis in accordance with national guidance. Any absence deemed unacceptable must be regarded as serious. An offender's flouting of a court order cannot be ignored or condoned. That is why we have put the warnings given to offenders on a statutory footing. This is a public protection measure that the previous Government signally failed to take. The hon. Member for Surrey Heath should explain to the Committee why the Conservative Government did nothing to ensure that court orders were enforced and the public protected. That Government were happy to allow a casual attitude to develop to this area of enforcement and did nothing to countervail that approach.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
We have taken action to ensure that community sentences are more rigorously enforced. It becomes particularly important in terms of the need to command public confidence. We are investing a great deal of time, energy and public resources in the "What Works" strategy, based on approaches and ways of working that are known to reduce crime. The only way to demonstrate that it is working is by people who are subject to the regimes and this form of training turning up to participate in them. If they do not, the basis of the work done to reduce their criminality is undermined and the public are put at risk. We are simply not prepared to tolerate that. Under clause 46, an offender who fails to comply with his community sentence without good reason must be returned to court with the presumption that he will be given a custodial sentence. Imprisonment will be for a maximum of three months, unless the relevant court takes the view that were it resentencing for the original offence it would impose a longer period of imprisonment. If that happened, the longer period would apply. The proposals do not apply to offenders under 18, or where the court takes the view that there are exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
The presumption of imprisonment for breach of a community sentence reflects the seriousness of flouting a court order. In some quarters people have commented that this measure would have an especially hard impact on younger offenders, who are more likely to breach. However, in giving them an adult rather than a young offender's sentence, the courts will have taken the view that they should be treated as adults and supervised accordingly. Therefore, for offenders who fail to learn and continue to breach community sentences, certainty of outcome is essential. Providing the courts with additional disposals is simply not the answer.<br><br>
I understand the points that will be urged by the hon. Member for Taunton, but I am afraid that a good case has not been made: we have tried it before, and it does not work. Certainty, on the other hand, has been shown to improve compliance. The HDC scheme is a good example of our aim—to achieve greater compliance, thereby ensuring that offenders turn up to benefit from the improved supervision and the new additional moneys that we are investing in rehabilitation. It is all about taking rehabilitation seriously.<br><br>
For the first time, adequate sums and the evidence base are in place, and the fact that these programmes have the capacity to turn lives around and to change people to enable them to live constructive, honest and law-abiding lives can be demonstrated. However, they must include the demand that offenders take the orders of the court seriously. Offenders must recognise that they are being given an opportunity to change: if they throw it back in the face of the court, they will go to prison. That is why we proposed this measure and why I commend it to the Committee.<br><br>
I understand what the hon. Member for Taunton and her colleagues seek to achieve through the amendments, but their effect would be to limit the statutory warning to certain cases rather than applying it to all failures to comply with an order, and to delete
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
the presumption of imprisonment for breach of community sentences. We are simply not prepared to go down that road. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments and to accept the Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise again for the delay in attending the Committee? I hope that the message got through that I had an important meeting with a Minister, which could not have been cancelled or moved. I had thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) would be in his place so that my absence would not have been noticed. I am delighted to have been missed, but I wonder whether I need to be here, as the Minister obviously knows what I am going to say. He might have said it for me and saved us all a lot of time.<br><br>
Breaches of community orders should be taken seriously and penalties should be applied for such breaches. Ensuring proper supervision of community orders is important not only as an aid to public confidence in community sentencing but as a means of improving public safety. I would not argue for a lax system of supervision or for allowing old lags—the people to whom the Minister referred—to come back and forth to courts with a series of excuses for breaching orders.<br><br>
Introducing the sort of automatic enforcement proposed in the clause, however, eliminates the discretion of professional supervising officers and shows a great lack of trust in their professionalism in carrying out their work. As the clause stands, breach offenders already face up to three months' imprisonment. I believe that greater compliance can be achieved in other ways, such as putting the onus on the service through performance management targets and proper monitoring and tracking. Amendments Nos. 164 and 165 refer to a particular tracking programme that has been undertaken by the probation service in inner London.<br><br>
The Minister will know that I do not always speak as a representative of the National Association of Probation Officers, as I have sometimes disagreed with its views. However, the association strongly believes that automatic enforcement should be limited to cases in which there has been a serious breach of an order. Amendment No. 163 seeks to clarify that. At the moment, a breach can vary from being 20 minutes late for an appointment—I accept that that should not be taken lightly and that part of the discipline of the community service order is turning up on time at the appointed place—to missing a session altogether or assaulting a probation officer. There is no disagreement between us about the extreme end of that spectrum, which should be treated as an automatic breach on account of its seriousness.<br><br>
Amendment No. 163 would allow personal difficulties to be taken into account when making decisions about a breach. The Minister spoke of his days in court, when he saw the people who persistently breached orders and heard all kinds of excuses. I am sure that he would also accept that some people who find themselves under a community order have, for various reasons—perhaps related to drug or alcohol
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0553">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
problems, housing or employment diffculties—habitually had a chaotic life style. For such people, it is difficult to meet the requirements of an order immediately. Part of the purpose of putting such people under an order is for the supervising officer to help them to achieve a more regular life style. If there were a first breach, a warning, a second breach, and then back to court, that might be too harsh. Someone who was genuinely trying to comply with an order might have difficulties, which those of us in this Room cannot imagine, in getting to the appropriate place on time.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 164 and 165 relate to subsections (4) and (5) and the power of magistrates to impose automatic imprisonment. As the Minister said, such imprisonment can be for up to three months, in the case of a proven breach, unless there are exceptional circumstances. In relation to the original offence, it was not considered appropriate to have a custodial sentence. However, if amendment No. 163 is not accepted, failure to comply with an order—even if not a serious breach—will mean that a court can impose a prison sentence of up to three months. It is important that people have the chance to deal with the problems that led to their offending. As I said, breaches can vary in seriousness, and it is important that magistrates have the discretion to reflect that when deciding whether to impose a custodial sentence.<br><br>
Currently, the probation service deals with breaches, and I dispute the Minister's assertion that there is a casual attitude to the breach of orders. I hope that he did not intend to make a blanket condemnation of the service. The primary responsibility of the service is to supervise orders, and one would not expect it to have a casual attitude to their imposition.<br><br>
As I said, the inner London probation service recently completed a piece of work known as breach tracker, of which I am sure that the Minister is well aware. For the past two years, all breach proceedings have been monitored. The results of 4,388 breach proceedings have been analysed, and, over the two-year period, those that were breached constituted 28 per cent. of the total case load. Of those who breached, 21 per cent. received a custodial sentence. For others, there were a variety of outcomes, including continuing with the order or continuing and imposing a fine. The use of automatic custodial sentences would not be a positive step forward. It might be right to impose a custodial sentence in some cases, but it should not be done automatically. The discretion should be wider than the clause allows. Ultimately, as the Home Office would accept, it will lead to an increase in the prison population, which is not necessary or, in itself a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief. Clearly, the hon. Member for Taunton has raised a number of issues, to which the Minister will respond. I have also been sent some material about the clause, which included work done by an organisation called Payback, which deals with issues related to community crime and community punishment. The leader of the Transport
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
and General Workers Union and a Labour peer are among its patrons, as are a Law Lord, a former Home Secretary, a journalist, an actress and a former Director General of the Prison Service. Clearly, that is a wide-ranging group of patrons. Even though I do not agree with some of what the organisation's director says, it deserves at least to have its concerns about the clause ventilated in Committee so that the Minister has an opportunity to deal with them.<br><br>
I should be grateful for answers to two points. The first is complex, and I expect that the Minister will have to write to members of the Committee about it. The organisation suggests that the Governments proposals are
<br><blockquote><p>in conflict with the Council of Europe's Rules of Community Sanctions and Measures and the 'Tokyo rules'—the UN Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures.</p></blockquote>
I am not familiar with those rules, but the Minister's advisers might enable him to tell us whether they apply—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that they do not—perhaps the organisation has got that wrong. However, that is one of its concerns.<br><br>
The organisation also says that the Government have estimated that the clause will increase the prison population by 15,000 prisoners a year. I do not know whether that is right, but if it is—Payback suggests that that is a conservative estimate—the clause will lead to all the usual problems. There will be huge costs, overcrowding and all the difficulties of resettling ex-prisoners—the organisation's raison d'être. Is that the Government's estimate of the number of extra prisoners? If so, what will the cost be and what proposals do the Government have for dealing with such a big increase in the prison population? How confident are they that the figure is right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall deal with the specific points made by Opposition Members and, in particular, by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, who, in acting as a mouthpiece for particular organisations, does not display the discernment that characterises the approach of the hon. Member for Taunton.<br><br>
Payback is a new, serious and well-intentioned organisation. I have met some of its representatives and look forward to meeting them again. I also look forward to the organisation making a good contribution to the debate. However, in this instance, it is utterly misguided and is in danger of undermining the good work that it has done and which it has the potential to do. The estimate that it gave—the hon. Gentleman parroted the figure of 15,000 extra prisoners—is hopelessly exaggerated. At the most, we are talking about a couple of thousand extra places a year. That is a possible figure and is by no means likely to result from the implementation of the measures.<br><br>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Taunton, the handling of enforcement issues by the probation service has got much better over the past two to three years, and the contribution of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0554">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
Association of Chief Officers of Probation has been considerable. That is the result of the new approach that the Government have brought to the issue. The approach of the previous Government to community sentences and rehabilitation was casual. They rubbished the probation service and did not invest in it, as we have done, or in rehabilitation. They allowed the service to wither on the vine, and their approach to public protection through rehabilitation was not serious. Our approach is serious, which is the reason for the clause and the amendment to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed the cultural change and change of attitude that the Government expect and have expected from probation officers during the past few years to their role in enforcement. Does the Minister accept that there is a tension for offenders between seeing a probation officer as something of a heavy-handed policeman, who will come down on them like a ton of bricks at the first sign of slight non-compliance with an order, and seeing him as someone whose role is partly to advise and support, if not befriend, and to help them end the chaotic life style of offending?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a question not of befriending, but of correcting. Others can befriend, which may involve mentoring. I am interested in the idea of mentors working with the probation service to provide that contribution towards rehabilitation, but the role of the probation service is to correct offending behaviour so that people can tackle chaotic life styles, indiscipline and lack of respect for the law and court orders that have brought them to the pass that they are in. That is why we must pay attention to the evidence that suggests that, in relation to such people's lives, certainty of outcome has a positive effect. The reverse is the case when professional discretion leads to a lack of certainty, which allows confusion and an approach less likely to produce positive outcomes.<br><br>
We recognise the importance of the warning process, which is why there is now one warning before a breach. There is a proper place for professional discretion, as staff have responsibility for arriving at a judgment of whether a failure has occurred for an acceptable reason. That is when the professionalism of the probation service will be important, subject to proper guidance on the role of the inspectorate and the national director.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. George Turner <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Norfolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister will guess that I have been intensively lobbied on the subject. He has given a coherent account of the Government's position, but will he say more about the key words, which are unacceptable failure "without reasonable excuse" and "exceptional circumstances"? It would help those of us who have been lobbied by people genuinely concerned with making the service work if he would explain what the Government intend those words to mean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. Let us consider circumstances that could arise. Someone might be late for an appointment because a child has fallen ill and has had to be taken to the accident and emergency department. When evidence of such an example is produced, clearly that is an acceptable failure. Similarly, someone might have a job interview that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
goes on longer than expected or occurs at a time when, for one reason or another, it was not possible to notify the probation officer. When supported by documentary evidence, such cases could also be regarded as acceptable failures.<br><br>
The important advantage of having national standards and a national director is that it enables probation service front-life staff to judge whether a failure to comply with a condition or requirement is acceptable. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Any more? Indeed, we have issued a circular as a starting point so that the service can begin to develop a uniform sense of what is and is not acceptable. I had an exchange earlier with the hon. Member for Taunton on the performance of the probation service. Some local probation services have taken enforcement seriously and have been repositories of best practice, while the practice in others has been, frankly, appalling, letting down the service as a whole. A national standard and a national director will enable us to raise the performance of the work so that it begins to approach the level of the relevant key performance indicator, which is, I think, 90 per cent.; it is currently between 55 and 60 per cent. in regard to some of the better performance services and others fall below that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend's objectives, but does he accept that the contraction of the probation service that occurred under the previous Government has created such a sketched service that some people on probation have to make extremely difficult and convoluted journeys? He has contested my constituency and will know that the journey from Flamstead to Watford, for example, takes an entire day. An upgrading of the service in areas where it has been attenuated will need to go hand-in-hand with the new arrangements so that our expectations of clients can realistically be met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend should just say yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not just fight my hon. Friend's seat; I lived and went to school there and still, as he knows, have close connections with it. I therefore know that it is stretching it a bit to say that it takes a day to get from Flamstead to Watford. However, I understand his point, which is why, as I said earlier in response to another of my hon. Friends, we need to look at best practice. I have visited probation services in rural areas—even more rural than Hemel Hempstead and Flamstead—that have adopted innovative approaches to fulfilling their roles. They are using church halls and different mobile centres. We intend the new National Probation Service to be assisted by the ways in which we now manage and best utilise the capital estate that will vest in it.<br><br>
We should examine new and imaginative ways of dealing with some of the issues of distance and sparsity, which my hon. Friend rightly put his finger on, to avoid excuses such as "I missed the bus" or "They cancelled the bus." The point made by both my hon. Friends is well taken. I urge the Committee to appreciate that we can serve the cause of rehabilitation

best by putting in place the rigorous enforcement framework that the clause is designed to underpin.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised the issue a long time ago and I have the impression that the Minister is drawing his remarks to an end, so I wanted to ask him whether, if he cannot answer the question now, he can write to me to explain why the Council of Europe rules and the Tokyo rules do not apply, as he said in a sedentary intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always more than happy to write to the hon. Gentleman—indeed, I spend a lot of time doing so. I have no objection to writing to him, because I can assure him that the provisions comply fully with our international treaty obligations. In fact, the probation service believes that the provisions point the way, internationally, to the service's future development.<br><br>
I attended Probation 2000, a successful international conference held by our probation service, and it was clear that the world was watching the Bill and the developments in our probation service, including its use of new technology and its more rigorous approach to enforcement. Other countries are examining our methods as ways of winning the public support and the confidence that they seek to engender in their probation services and in the cause of rehabilitation. I am optimistic that we can build on the best traditions of the probation service in England and Wales, while placing a new focus on enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hilton Dawson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster and Wyre)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the issue the credibility of community sentences among magistrates and judges in Crown courts? Anybody who wants to increase the success of community sentences and deal more effectively with offending behaviour in the community—which I suggest is often a better place for such work than prison—should support making community sentences effective and credible with the people who will hand them down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put it better myself. On that happy note, and with the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) ringing in our ears, I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall start with the likely increase in the prison population if the measure goes ahead. There seems to be a huge discrepancy between the 2,000 that the Home Office has calculated and the 15,000 suggested by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. I put that alongside the Minister's assertion that the probation service in many parts of the country is not dealing with breaches effectively. I am not clear whether he thinks that the regulations in themselves will enable the probation service to deal more effectively with breaches so that they will not happen, or whether there is still some discrepancy in the figures. If things are as bad as the Minister says, 2,000 is an underestimate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister can explain where that figure comes from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To whom shall I give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I simply want to clarify, in case the hon. Lady misheard me, that the figure that I was putting forward was not my own, but one—[Hon. Members: "Aah."] No, the Minister accused me earlier of parroting the briefing that I was sent, but I made it quite clear that I did not agree with a number of the things that the organisation had said, and I queried the figure that it suggested it had got from Government estimates. It is a little more complicated than the hon. Lady was suggesting. The question is not merely which figure is right, but why that organisation, which the Minister said is reputable although mistaken on this issue, thinks that this was a Government figure. That is the mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was rising a moment ago to answer that. He has obviously thought better of it. The amendments produced quite an interesting debate and signs of life on the Government Benches, which is always welcome. I have had many reasons to put in bids for better buses in my constituency, but I had not thought of doing so to help offenders. We shall certainly add that to our armoury.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady have, like me, a fairly recently closed probation office in her constituency which gives rise to some of these difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not. Many parts of my constituency are a long way from anywhere and have never had a probation office, and are never likely to have one even though they have their fair share of offenders.<br><br>
The Minister said that the main role of the probation service is correction. He talked about correcting chaotic lifestyles. He also said that certainty of outcome would have a positive effect on people with such a lifestyle and behaviour. I agree with him that certainty of outcome is important, but probation officers and people whose job it is to carry out this work must have spotted that too. I would argue, as would the National Association of Probation Officers, that it takes time to correct a chaotic lifestyle. It cannot be done just by the courts saying, "You will serve a community order. You will turn up for your first appointment on day one and hey presto you will suddenly be able to make appointments and get your life together."<br><br>
We must all have met people who find just getting up in the morning and doing something on a regular basis challenging. That cannot be cured overnight. The conclusion that I have come to during the debate is that we could meet my concerns about aspects of the clause if the provisions did not come into force until, say, three months into a community order. Clearly by that time there is more chance that the imposition of timetabling and discipline will have had an impact. To then say that a breach of the order is taken seriously might have met my concerns about natural justice

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
rather better. I hope that the Minister will consider that point. There is not as much difference between us on this as may at first appear.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre made some good points and I am sure that <i>Hansard</i> will reveal that I opened my remarks on the amendments by saying that I support making the rehabilitation role of community sentences more effective and more credible to protect the public better. Given that my comments in the summing up have caused the Minister to think further about the issue, I shall withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Lady that her amendments were never moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I moved my amendment, Mr. Maxton, and did not feel bound to move the hon. Lady's. Call me old-fashioned: we may be inclusive, but not that inclusive.<br><br>
As always the hon. Lady has made some serious points. I have listened to her carefully. I do not underestimate the extent to which the probation service has seriously embraced the message sent out by the chief inspector of probation, Ministers and the Home Office about the importance of enforcement. The Association of Chief Officers of Probation has demonstrated remarkable leadership in improving the enforcement culture within the probation service. I give full credit for that. ACOP's audit is extremely helpful. It shows considerable improvement from 51 per cent. to 66 per cent., but there is still some distance to be travelled in view of the key performance indicator of 90 per cent.<br><br>
We recognise that chaotic lifestyles cannot be turned around overnight. No one is suggesting that. Amendment No. 172 specifically allows for the impact of drug abstinence orders and drug-abstinent conditions on other community orders, which have to be managed in a particular way. It remains important to continue to send out the strong message, which will now be on the statute book, that community sentences are not a soft option. As my hon. Friends rightly stressed, it is an important issue of public confidence. Sentences must be secure and the national probation service is going to be properly resourced in order to deliver the what works programme, which provides real prospects of turning lives around and correcting offending behaviour. For that reason, I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Taunton will not press her amendments to the vote today. We must move forward with a clause that will deliver the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the question, let me explain that when I select an amendment which is grouped with others, only the first amendment is moved: the others are for debate only. If a member of the Committee wishes to move a particular amendment formally at an appropriate point thereafter, I would accept the proposal. Only the first amendment of a group of amendments is moved.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee long, but clause 47 makes the usual provision for the Secretary of State to have further powers. As you will remember, Mr. Maxton, before Easter we had long debates on whether anyone would bother to count up all the extra powers that the Secretary of State has given himself in the Bill. I did not spend my Easter recess doing that, but whenever such a power is provided it is important to ask the Minister when the Government plan to issue regulations. Does he have an idea of the proposed timetable in which the first set of regulations under the clause will come into effect? If so, I am sure that it would be of interest and would help the Committee. If not, no doubt we shall be informed in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My response is that it will be as soon as is practicable after Parliament has, if it is so minded, given the Bill a fair wind.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TESTING PERSONS IN POLICE DETENTION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I do not propose to detain the Committee long, but it struck me that several issues in some celebrated cases related to testing people who are under police detention, as does clause 48. As the Minister will recall, the question of what powers the police have over people in custody in a police station is a sensitive one. On one occasion in the past 12 months, serious civil disorder involving demonstrations outside Brixton police station followed allegations of various untoward occurrences involving people in the custody of the police at that station.<br><br>
It is incumbent on us not to let through on the nod matters that relate to new powers of testing in police stations. Does the Minister believe that the police are comfortable with how the powers—which account for nearly two pages of the Bill—will be administered? What discussions has he had with senior police officers on the matter? I would not like it to be thought at a later stage that the Committee did not examine police
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
powers of drug testing in police stations. I am sure that the Minister will understand that I raise the matter seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should not merely let the clause through on the nod. Police officers to whom I have spoken have expressed anxieties about civil liberties. We have heard the Minister's views on Liberty in the past; they may have changed over the past 10 years or so. Liberty has problems with the clause, too.<br><br>
Once an offender has been convicted, if circumstances lead to the suspicion of a link between drug taking or drug addiction and the offence, I would concede the acceptability of testing, because it may be relevant to sentencing or to preventing future crimes. However, testing someone after conviction is significantly different from the circumstances covered in the clause. The people whom we are discussing will be presumed to be innocent, and a percentage of them will be found to be innocent after they have been through the court procedure. Not everyone who is charged is found guilty, and not every charge is correct.<br><br>
If a police officer has reasonable grounds—not even evidence; perhaps the Minister will elaborate on what reasonable grounds might be—to believe that a link exists between drug use and the suspected offence by someone who has still not been found guilty, he will be able to order a drug test. The person who knows himself to be innocent of any crime and has been wrongfully charged may say, "I do not see why I should submit myself to a drugs test". That person knows that he does not take drugs. Given that taking drugs is not an offence under the current law, we shall create a new offence of refusing to take the drugs test for which imprisonment of up to three months can be imposed. That is hard to justify and it is a disproportionate interference with the rights of an individual who, I repeat, is treated under the law as an innocent individual. The police will have to make the decision, not a judicial authority, so the charge will not have to pass the usual tests of evidence, but those of reasonable grounds for suspicion. Liberty would certainly question whether such action would infringe article 8 on rights to privacy, and whether such a power could be justified prior to conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 48 allows the police to request a sample from a person who is charged with a trigger offence and is aged 18 years and over. A sample may also be requested when the person is not charged with a trigger offence, but when a police officer of at least the rank of inspector has grounds for suspecting that the misuse of specified class A drugs caused or contributed to the offence.<br><br>
The clause gives additional powers to the police to detain a person after charge for the purposes of providing a sample for up to six hours. It also makes it an offence for a person to fail to provide a sample on request under penalty of imprisonment of up to three months and/or a level 4 fine. I emphasise to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath that because these new powers are a proportionate but serious response to a grave issue that causes interference not hitherto felt
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
necessary with the liberty of an individual, it is necessary and important to pilot such powers. The police will be fully involved with the monitoring and the evaluation of the pilots. We will be amenable to representations from a wide range of groups, including Liberty, about the proper conclusions to be drawn from the pilots.<br><br>
If a person parks his car in the King's Cross area, the chances are that it will be broken into and the CD player and radio removed and flogged so that someone can feed a habit. It is a feature of that area that people steal and commit various offences to fund their drug habit. The link exists. Such matters are not fanciful; they are based on evidence. Evidence leads one to believe that such trigger offences are taking place. The police may search premises and find the paraphernalia that is associated with the use of crack cocaine or heroin. It may well be reasonable to conclude that that is a case where such testing might be justified. I use that as an example of the sort of reasonable conclusion that the police would be entitled to draw, with the safeguard of inspector rank, from that particular discovery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes again the case that, particularly in certain areas, there is a strong link between acquisitive crime and feeding a drug habit, and that that justifies testing post-conviction. He has not, however, said anything that justifies testing someone who is merely charged with an offence and who may indeed be innocent of that offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me take an example of a non-trigger offence including a crime of violence. In the King's Cross area there is a real problem of drug abuse—although that also applies to a number of other areas. A crime of violence may be committed involving a fight over a particular patch that someone has staked out as being where they do their business. Whatever that particular business is, it may well be reasonable in those circumstances to test for drugs the people engaged in that particular bout of violence. It is important that we have the information that may be significant in informing, for instance, a bail decision. That decision may lead to someone, quite properly because their crime of violence is drug-linked, being excluded from returning to that area. I give that as an example. It is clearly of importance and significance in preventing further offending.<br><br>
It was not just an ordinary fight that happened to occur outside the cross London line at King's Cross. It was a fight over turf: drugs turf. It is right in those circumstances that there should be some evidence of what caused the offence. Indeed, as a result of that test someone may be directed towards counselling or therapy or treatment of some sort. It ought, therefore, to be seen as a guide and an aid rather than as some sort of draconian inhibitor. It is designed to help and there is a desperate need for that help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Cryer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what my hon. Friend says about King's Cross because I used to work there on the <i>Tribune</i> newspaper, which is a publication that my right hon. Friend knows and loves. When I worked there, the office was continually being broken into. It was suspected that the perpetrators were either drug dealers or perhaps the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
agents of Millbank. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I just throw that in. Nevertheless, this legislation does apply more widely than simply to King's Cross, as we all recognise.<br><br>
I have two questions for my hon. Friend. First of all, does it not undermine the basic tenet of innocence until proven guilty? Secondly, the issue of article 8 of the European convention on human rights was involved in an amendment that I tabled on clause 41. Arguably, article 8 could be even more profoundly involved in this instance on the basis of an invasion of privacy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the provision offends the maxim of innocent until proved guilty in any respect. After all, this is a test. It is not an offence to have in your bloodstream evidence of the fact that you have used drugs. That is not the offence. Possession is an offence. It would be an offence if someone were found to have broken into the offices of a respectable newspaper that happened to be located in King's Cross and took a line that flew in the face of all reason. The offence would be to break into the offices of the much-loved organ of the left.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The test for drugs is designed to ensure that the court has the information necessary for it to arrive at a conclusion as to how best to make the various decisions required of it. Those decisions have enormous significance for the public—the potential victims of crime—while someone is at large and drugs influence his conduct. It also has implications for the person using the drugs. Before any determination is made of guilt or innocence, he will have an opportunity to show that he is coming to grips with the problem that may have led to his being accused of the offence. That is significant to the individual's welfare when it comes to the imposition of a sentence by the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way again on this serious point. He said that the court would know the outcome of the test before deciding on innocence or guilt, and the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Cryer) asked whether the clause flew against the general presumption of innocence in British law. If the court knew that someone had proved positive in a drugs test, would that not have some bearing on a judgment of innocence or guilt of the crime for which he or she had been charged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch on the disposal that follows the determination of innocence and guilt. The relevance is to the disposal and to the decision in relation to bail, not to whether someone is guilty of an offence.<br><br>
My hon. Friend made a point about article 8, which is specific. As I have suggested to him, it allows necessary and proportioned interference in the private life of an individual for the purposes of crime prevention. That is what we contend is the case in relation to the clause. The point is to ensure a policy justification for the legal framework that we are putting in place. We maintain that there is a policy justification, and that there is evidence to back it up. The legal framework being put in place is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
proportionate response to the problem, so I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>

RIGHT TO BAIL: RELEVANCE OF DRUG MISUSE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee long. It is a pleasure to say that we regard the clause as a helpful additional power. I was aware that magistrates and judges felt that there was a defect in the previous Labour Government's Bail Act 1976. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I heard that aright. Was there not a period of 18 years between the previous Labour Government and this one? Was not the hon. Gentleman a member of the party that had stewardship of the nation's affairs during that interim period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister recognises that I am teasing him, but despite the pleasantries, we all recognise that the power would be a useful addition. It would clearly be helpful for magistrates and judges to have regard, when deciding matters of bail, to whether people have misused drugs. As the Minister said to the hon. Member for Taunton in our previous debate, it could be very relevant in deciding whether someone should be given bail. It makes a pleasant change to be able to welcome something that the Government are doing. On this occasion, they have got it right.</span></p>

RELEASE ON LICENCE ETC: CONDITIONS AS TO MONITORING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 36, line 6, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) In making a decision to release a person from prison, by virtue of any enactment, the Secretary of State shall not take into account the fact that electronic monitoring of that person would, by virtue of the provisions of this section, be applicable as a condition of that person's release.'.</p></blockquote>
You correctly anticipated earlier, Mr. Maxton, that I would return to some of the general points about electronic tagging when speaking to the amendment. I shall not repeat what I said earlier, but will say in response to the Minister that if the Home Affairs Select Committee had known when it was compiling its report that home detention curfew orders would result in people convicted of such serious offences being given electronic tags, it would have been unlikely to give the proposal such an unqualified welcome. Since the enactment of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, there has been much change in the Government's stance on the use of home detention curfews.<br><br>
I wish to set out the variety of answers we have had from the Minister and the Home Secretary. In a written answer to a question tabled by my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) on 22 March, the Minister said—choosing his words carefully—that
<br><blockquote><p>The measure will not change any prisoner's eligibility for release.</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to "eligibility". He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>… the wider availability of electronic monitoring may influence release decisions m a small number of cases involving prisoners serving determinate sentences of four years or more who are eligible for parole, and where the risk assessment is finely balanced.</p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to say that the Government estimated
<br><blockquote><p>that the parole rate may rise by up to 4 per cent., which would represent approximately 230 additional prisoners granted parole per annum.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 559–60W.]</p></blockquote>
However, on Second Reading of the Bill, six days later, the Home Secretary reiterated the undertaking, which I quoted earlier, in regard to sex offenders and other high-risk offenders and said that he would direct the parole board to that effect and reinterpreted the Minister's previous answer by saying that it referred only to
<br><blockquote><p>certain offenders … who may need the punishment of a longer sentence but who pose no wider risk to the public.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 March 2000; Vol. 347, c. 234.]</p></blockquote>
That takes us to the question of what constitutes a risk. I would have thought that most ordinary people would regard someone who had been convicted of manslaughter, wounding or attempted murder as a clear risk to the public. That is why so much consternation was caused by the written answer that I have just quoted.<br><br>
The day after that Second Reading debate, the Minister gave a written answer in which he stated that it was not possible to give a breakdown of the offences of prisoners who would be released earlier as a result of a change in the risk assessments.<br><br>
In a written answer to a question tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald shortly before the Easter recess, the Home Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>the timing of the release of serious, high risk and sex offenders</p></blockquote>
would not be affected by the availability of tagging. That seems to redefine yet further the Home Secretary's earlier answer, in which he certainly did not make it clear how the terms "serious" and "high risk" were defined.<br><br>
In what seemed a somewhat disjointed written answer, the Home Secretary went on to say that those released earlier would be those
<br><blockquote><p>at the lower end of the offending scale.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 376W.]</p></blockquote>
We would say that those sentenced to four years or more are almost always guilty of pretty serious offences. That is why the courts have given them sentences of that length.<br><br>
We have tabled further written questions. I think that the question tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) might have been answered today, but as we have been in Committee, I have not yet seen the written answer.

We are trying to find out what the Home Secretary's most recent cryptic answer—further redefining what the Government have in mind—actually means. We seek further clarification of the Home Secretary's answer of 17 April. I do not know whether the written answer will simply say that he will reply shortly or whether we will have a more detailed answer. Our concerns are very serious. With amendment No. 1, we want to prevent all release decisions from being influenced by the availability of electronic tagging. We seek absolute clarity, so that there is no need for redefinition. The various interpretations given on Second Reading and in the three written answers are not consistent with one another. The Bill should say that no release decision should ever be influenced by the availability of electronic tagging. We think that that will be much more clearly understood by the public. Now that it has been revealed exactly which prisoners are being released early with electronic tags, the public are bound to be concerned that so many are such serious offenders, going far beyond any of the evidence given to the Select Committee. When we debated the matter on Second Reading, those concerns were already being ventilated.<br><br>
Therefore, if the Minister will not accept the specific words of our amendment, we want to know whether he is prepared to contemplate tabling at a later stage an amendment that makes it absolutely clear that at no stage should any release decision be influenced by the availability of electronic tagging.<br><br>
It is not right that the number of people given parole should be increased, even by the 230 additional prisoners that the Minister mentioned. As the Bill stands, we think that that is probably an underestimate anyway. It could mean that a lot of more serious offenders are let out much earlier. The Government are leaving the door open for parole decisions to be influenced, which is completely wrong. We hope that the Minister will respond seriously, because there is huge public concern that the prisoners being released early with electronic tags are not those for whom that was ever envisaged. I think that the public would be horrified that people who have committed such serious offences are being released after serving such a short time in custody. Prison sentences should mean what they say, but we do not believe that that is happening. The Government are using a lot of weasel words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would mean that decisions made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to release a prisoner could not be influenced by the possible inclusion of an electronic monitoring condition in the release licence as provided for in the Bill. Such an amendment would affect those prisoners serving short-term sentences who are eligible for home detention curfew, those eligible for release on a temporary licence, determinate sentence prisoners serving 15 years or more and all mandatory life sentence prisoners.<br><br>
The Secretary of State does not make decisions on whether to release determinate prisoners serving between four and 15 years or discretionary life sentence prisoners. In those cases, the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
State is bound in law by the parole board's recommendation.<br><br>
Our position is that clause 50 allows for the use of electronic monitoring as a condition of supervision in the full range of cases where prisoners are released on licence. Electronic monitoring is an effective way of monitoring compliance with conditions imposed on offenders. The availability of such a condition will improve the probation service's ability to monitor compliance and increase the protection of the public.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
All decisions about the discretionary release of prisoners involve careful risk assessment. This is essential and will continue to be the case in the future as it is now. In the vast majority of cases, we expect the availability of electronic monitoring to have no impact on release decisions. Indeed, in cases where the Secretary of State—either personally or through the Prison Service—is responsible for release decisions, we do not expect that the implementation of the measures will impact at all on release decisions. I must make that absolutely clear.<br><br>
Prison Service orders will make clear that there are no circumstances in which the availability of the new electronic monitoring provisions in the Bill should influence decisions on release made by the Prison Service, on behalf of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The Home Secretary has also made it clear that he will be directing the parole board that where it is considering the release of a sex offender or other high risk offender, it should not be influenced by the availability of these new monitoring powers. That direction will cover any sex offender required to register under the Sex Offenders Act 1997, and any sexual or violent offender who is serving an "extended sentence" as provided for in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The directions will also apply to all prisoners serving a life sentence, to other prisoners serving a determinate sentence for homicide or attempted homicide, terrorism, arson, robbery or assault, and to any other prisoner whose offending or other behaviour suggests that he poses a clear risk of violence to the public. The definition could include prisoners convicted of drugs offences, burglary, and many other offences depending on the circumstances of the case.<br><br>
While I understand the concerns behind the proposed amendment, I do not accept that this is the right way to address them. It would be unprecedented to set down in statute the factors that should or should not be taken into account when deciding on release. Risk assessment is a complex and difficult process. It is not one that is easily amenable to the confines of statutory drafting. Of its very nature it has to be a complex process because that is how the public is best protected. The public is not well served by seeking to put it into some sort of statutory or legislative straitjacket. It just does not work that way in the real world, which is why successive Governments of all political persuasions have avoided doing so. That is why I particularly deprecate the approach of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in relation to this matter. It is not protecting the public at all.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
To specify one such factor—in this case, the availability of electronic monitoring—has the potential to create other serious legal difficulties. It could be inferred by the courts, for instance, that there are no other factors that should be precluded from consideration when the Secretary of State is deciding on release. This would leave the door open to prisoners who are refused release to bring challenges on the basis that the Secretary of State had failed to consider a whole range of issues. That cannot be desirable and in the public interest.<br><br>
The amendment would create a completely anomalous situation whereby decisions on the release of prisoners sometimes at the lower end of the risk scale, and the very highest end, would be covered. A whole range of sex offenders, however, and other serious offenders would not be covered. I cannot believe that that is what the Opposition intended in their drafting. I am sure that it was not. Even if they were to re-draft their amendment so that it more accurately reflected what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has laid out on his stall this afternoon, we would resist the amendment for the reasons that I have given. We do not believe that it would be sensible to apply a statutory fetter to decision making on discretionary release. The Government believe that there will be a small number of cases for which the parole board may want to take the availability of electronic monitoring into account, and for which it would be right to do so. However, that would amount to a very small number of cases, and the parole board would be subject to the directions that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has outlined and that I have reiterated this afternoon.<br><br>
Electronic monitoring would be used only at the lower end of the offending scale, where there is no risk of violence to the public. The use of that facility in those circumstances may provide a significant extra reassurance that may influence a decision about release. We want to extend the use of that facility because it provides additional public protection and supports effective resettlement when properly used. We do not propose to rule out altogether the possibility that a limited number of release decisions might be influenced by the availability of electronic monitoring, but we are making clear in Prison Service orders and in directions to the parole board the limits that should apply. We believe that our proposals strike the right balance, and for that reason I commend the clause, unamended, to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that we simply cannot take the Minister's word for it, in the light of the words of the Home Secretary, who said that the Government had
<br><blockquote><p>no plans or intention whatever to provide for electronic tagging to facilitate the early release of serious or sexual offenders.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 November 1999; Vol. 340, c. 27]</p></blockquote>
Those words could not have been more unequivocal, and yet, by my arithmetic, approximately 7,000 of the 18,000 prisoners released early had been convicted of wounding, drug dealing or burglary. Those are serious offences. The general public were told that there were no plans to provide for the early release of serious offenders. Does the Minister think that the general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
public do not consider those who are convicted of those offences to be serious offenders?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous. He knows that the reference he quotes is to the home detention curfew, which would apply in sentences of less than four years to each of the categories that he mentioned. To use that as an example to undermine the clause in the Bill that seeks to use electronic tagging is simply disingenuous. He verges on the positively intellectually dishonest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit rich, given all the various reinterpretations and sophistries of the Minister and the Home Secretary in their description of these provisions, which I set out when I moved the amendment. We have had four different versions of how the clause will operate—two in the House from the Minister and the Home Secretary, and two in written answers. The four are not consistent with each other. When the Minister says, as he did in an earlier debate, that tagging arrangements have been 90 per cent. successful, the British public will wonder how many serious offences were committed by the other 10 per cent. We will have to return to the issue, because I do not accept the Minister's reassurances. I feel confident that in another place the matter will be of grave concern. There may even be concerns expressed by members of the Minister's own party about the way in which the Government have broken all their promises about electronic tagging. The practice in operation is wholly different from that described by Ministers. I promise the Minister that we will return to the matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

SUPERVISION OF YOUNG OFFENDERS AFTER RELEASE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need not detain the Committee long. It is a substantial clause, however, which deals with an important issue—the supervision of young offenders after release—so will the Minister clarify exactly how the provision will operate and how many people will be affected by it?<br><br>
It is a matter of grave concern to all members of the Committee and to the general public when chances for the criminal careers of young offenders to be halted are passed by. We all recognise the enormous saving to the public purse of rehabilitation at an early age. The Minister and I have both reflected—from our different experiences in the criminal courts—on how many serious offences are committed by young offenders. It is possible to prosecute or defend someone who, at the age of 17, has already acquired four pages of previous convictions.<br><br>
It is important not to allow something as important as the supervision of young offenders after release to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
pass on the nod, so I would be grateful if the Minister would provide further clarification of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of numbers, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the details, but he should bear in mind that it will affect only those who are not released on licence and will apply only where a licence does not extend beyond three months.<br><br>
The clause amends section 65 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 so that electronic monitoring conditions may be added to a notice of supervision, and secondly, so that a drug testing requirement can be included in the notice of supervision in cases where the offender was sentenced for a trigger offence and is at least 18 at the time of release. Trigger offences include property crime, robbery and class A drugs offences.<br><br>
It is important to recognise that the clause will enable and facilitate a new way for young offenders to stay on the straight and narrow. It builds on the work done with such offenders during their custody. It is important to ensure that the provision is ECHR compliant. A young offender's period of supervision and associated conditions may extend beyond the end of the sentence because of the minimum three-month supervision requirement, but clause 51 prohibits the use of electronic monitoring or drug testing beyond the end of the sentence.<br><br>
The response is proportionate, and we believe that it will be welcomed. We shall issue guidance to the probation service and to youth offending teams on how best to use monitoring and drug testing requirements in notices of supervision. We intend to pilot the new powers before full implementation. The programmes will be rolled out on the basis of evidence about how these measures deliver in practice. With that assurance, and my undertaking to write to the hon. Gentleman with the detailed figures, I hope that he will accept the clause.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing)'.</p></blockquote>
This is a technical amendment, which corrects the reference linking the definitions "specified Class A drug" and "trigger offence" to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. I commend the amendment to members of the Committee, who will wish to reflect on the fact that the point of clause 53 is to prevent the new final warning regime provided by clause 46 being applied in respect of a community order made before the clause becomes effective, and that it defines the term "Class A drug" used in the Bill in the same way as the term used in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The term "trigger offence" has the meaning given in schedule 5 to the Bill.</span></p>

ACCESS TO DRIVER LICENSING RECORDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations to allow the bulk transfer of driver licensing data from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency—DVLA—to the Police Information Technology Organisation—PITO. This is a long-awaited measure by the police and others concerned with the prevention of crime, especially vehicle crime. Substantial gains in the reduction of vehicle crime have produced genuine dividends from police effort and co-operation and partnership between the public and private sectors. These were facilitated greatly by the impact of the crime and disorder legislation introduced by our Government. The clause underpins the steps forward that were made by the partnership approach to reducing vehicle crime. The clause gives the Secretary of State specific powers to permit the bulk transfer of data to assist the police in their work on vehicle crime. I commend the clause to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause seems an eminently sensible operational aid to the work of the police. All parts of the Committee would no doubt greatly favour the maximum use of information technology to assist the police. From time to time, Members of Parliament receive correspondence from constituents about various problems with the DVLA and its computers, and the fact that sometimes erroneous information is recorded. Obviously we want the police to have the best possible information. Have specific problems arisen? How well is the PITO, which is a relatively recently created organisation, operating? If he can reassure me about that, I can accept that there will be great opportunities for the police to benefit from using IT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: PITO is operating very well indeed. It is well and professionally led—and I speak from some experience, having had ministerial responsibility for this area of law. PITO is a non-departmental public body that operates the police national computer. It is intended that drivers' information will be transferred on to the PNC to enable the police to have full, instant access to drivers' records for road traffic law enforcement rather than having to rely on the DVLA to provide information case by case. The police have a good working relationship with the DVLA but clearly it would be more efficient for information to be bulk downloaded on to the system. This will bring into force the lessons learned from a three-month research study in 1995, which estimated that motorists are unable to provide necessary driver and vehicle documentation at the time of a police request on about 3.34 million occasions each year. A driving licence is one of the three most requested documents in such circumstances, arising in about 85 per cent. of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
cases. Police efficiency gains of up to £8.6 million will result from the saving of police time in terms of the administration burden at police stations.<br><br>
The proposals will be welcomed by motorists. I referred earlier to the partnership between the private and public sector, which is most visible in the vehicle crime reduction action team, to which the motor and insurance industries make an important contribution. In September 1999, it recommended that the law should be changed in such a way. I believe that that will be warmly welcomed, not only by motorists and the police but the general public, as a real aid to crime prevention and reduction I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by the unanimous support for the measure.</span></p>

FAILURE TO SECURE REGULAR ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL: INCREASE IN PENALTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the clause, as is my party's education spokesman, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). It allows for the maximum fine to be more than doubled, and for up to three months' imprisonment for parents who fail to secure regular school attendance for their children. That will not, in itself, do anything to help parents who are struggling to ensure that their children attend school regularly. It is absolutely draconian, and not likely to help in any way. It is more than likely to put families that are already dysfunctional into an even worse position.<br><br>
Families that have most difficulty in getting their children to attend school on a regular basis are likely to come from the poorest areas, although not exclusively. They are likely to have the lowest incomes, and multiple problems in all sorts of areas of life. If a parent—perhaps a one-parent family, although it will not be exclusively, or the majority of, one-parent families—is sent to prison for failure to ensure that a child goes to school, the child will be more than likely to have to go into residential care, which will make matters even worse for the family, and impose even more stresses and strains in the future. It would be much better if the Government were to put their attention, resources and support for families into parenting projects. I accept that they have introduced some welcome initiatives, some of which are at the pilot stage and not yet operating throughout the country. However, help for projects such as early intervention and home tuition-which would assist children who are in fear of bullying or suffering from school phobia to make the transition—would be a far better use of resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady seriously imagine that the increased penalty will be the sole response to children's non-attendance at school? Surely she is not suggesting that the range of interventions that can be tried to help children with all kinds of difficulties will be precluded, simply because the Government are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V007P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
saying, strongly and clearly, "Children must go to school."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I clearly have difficulty in getting my point across to the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I do not know whether he wilfully misunderstands me. Clearly, the Government do not intend to drop all their other welcome initiatives to improve parenting skills or help to ensure that children attend school regularly. I am not saying that for one minute. I am arguing that the imposition of the extra draconian penalty will not help parents to deal better with their children or to be more successful in attending school. What will help them are early interventions from social workers and health visitors, parenting projects and home tuition. Doubling the fine for poor attendance at school is simply another huge sum that poor families will not be able to pay, as a result of which they will opt for the alternative punishment of going to prison for three months. That punishment to parents who are not functioning well will not help them to function better; it will make life worse for both them and their children. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman does not understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand entirely the hon. Lady's response to the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. Does she share my puzzlement about the provision? Is it not rather odd for there to be one clause about such an issue in the middle of a Bill that concerns criminal justice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to share the hon. Gentleman's puzzlement. The Minister knows that I am seldom uncharitable, but the issue is so controversial. This ridiculous clause may have been put into the Bill deliberately in the hope that anyone who is concerned about education will not notice it. The right place for it to be debated would be in discussions on an education Bill, not one concerning criminal justice. However, I am sure that the Minister will give us an eloquent, if not worth while, explanation of why the clause is in the Bill.<br><br>
If the current fine does not concentrate the minds of parents to persuade them that they can do something by themselves to encourage their children to go to school, doubling the fine and introducing a sentence of three months' imprisonment certainly will not. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will say that it will concentrate the minds of parents more if serious consequences follow their failure to ensure that their children attend school. I have not read his brief, but I am sure that he will say that. If he knows what I am about to say before I say it, I can imagine what he will say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady say something about the 80 per cent. of parents who make no effort to respond to their children's truancy? She claims that we are letting children down, but many families let their children down. We must rescue them from the terrible penalties of drug abuse, crime and the difficulties that absence from school so often precipitates. That is the purpose of the clause.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not explain why the clause is in the Bill. It makes it clear why there is already a penalty for children failing to attend school, but it does not explain why it will help the position by doubling the penalty and introducing a custodial sentence. I agree with the basic tenet of the hon. Gentleman's remarks that school truancy, or absence from school through exclusion, is likely to mean "the devil finds work for idle hands". Those children who are out of school are more likely to get into trouble, after which there is a downward spiral. I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should be doing all that we can to prevent children from getting into that state. If they end up in trouble, it is their parents who have let them down as has society.<br><br>
Parents will not be helped to support, advice and give their children proper directions by the threat of even more draconian penalties. Those who fail to ensure that their children attend school are not functioning well and such penalties will not help them to function any better. If a child is out of his parents' control or under stress, threats of such sentences will create more panic and fear in a family that is already under strain. That is why I shall oppose the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Cryer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have concerns about clause 55, which is clearly shared by other members of the Committee judging by the fevered throng on the Tory Benches after the start of the debate. It is good to see Opposition Members attending a debate. Fines not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale amount to £2,500. It is highly unlikely that families with truanting children could afford that. They will be unable to pay and could face prison sentences. I sat in the public galleries of several courts a few years ago, and saw people who had mounted up fines over time. In one case, a man who had been convicted and fined yet again asked to receive a custodial sentence to wipe out the fines that he had built up over years. Parents will be jailed and children will be left to be cared for by social services.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
I talked to a headmaster in my constituency last week and mentioned clause 55. He told me about several truanting children at his secondary school who had younger brothers and sisters. One boy comes from a large family in which truanting is a problem. He has truanted a great deal, and under the new sanctions his parents could face imprisonment. In that case, he and his younger brothers and sisters could be put into care by social services, which I do not see as an especially progressive step by the Government.<br><br>
I understand why the measures are being introduced, but they will have consequences. Many more children might be put into care. Families who in most cases already have enormous problems will face even more of them when the parents cannot pay the fines and end up in prison. I would like my right hon. Friend the Minister to give the reasons for clause 55, which seems to be a far-reaching measure that could have radical consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it will help the hon. Member for Weaver Vale or the Committee, but I

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
have a lot to say on the matter. Given the hour, I may be interrupted; we shall see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot be interrupted. The motion to adjourn can be taken only at the end of a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. Maxton, I shall continue. I share the concerns raised by the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Taunton. As I suggested in an intervention on the hon. Lady, the clause is in the wrong place. It is extraordinary that the Bill contains one anomalous provision that relates to schools. She rightly said in response that the proper place for the matter would be an education Bill. However, the Government have treated the Bill as a portmanteau, as they have earlier Bills. They have used the opportunity of a law and order Bill to try to be macho to substitute for the nonsense that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has made of so many education matters since the Government came to power. They want to be able at least to say that they have doubled the penalty for parents who allow their children to truant.<br><br>
As has been said, the problem of children who truant is serious, and there must be a variety of responses short of a custodial sentence. We need to see a great deal of work done by local authority social services departments, as the hon. Members for Taunton and for Lancaster and Wyre have mentioned. In our education system, parents find that the governors and head teachers of schools constantly complain that they are put under huge pressure because of the vast number of glossy brochures with which the Department for Education and Employment constantly burdens them. We have endless nonsense and bureaucracy in schools because of the Government. Every governing body in my constituency and every head teacher to whom I have spoken since the Government came to power complains that people are not allowed to get on with their jobs because of the huge burden of paperwork that the Government have dropped on them. The Government's response is not to cut down on the bureaucracy or to deal with the real problems in our schools, but to say, "In a criminal justice Bill, we will double the potential penalty on a parent whose child truants." The hon. Lady is right to say that that is not an appropriate response. We are firmly against truancy, but to suggest, as the Minister will, that the clause is the only appropriate response that the Government can come up with is arrant nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dawson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that it is extremely important to be able to tell parents who wilfully do not send their children to school, "There is a serious sanction."? How determined is the hon. Gentleman to deal with the problem of truancy, which underlies so many other problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The serious penalty already exists—the Education Act 1996 made it clear that there was a serious sanction. I am criticising the Government's tokenism. They are simply saying, in a macho way, "We will double the penalty." That is nonsense and will achieve nothing—a serious sanction is already in place. The proposals substitute macho politics for any degree of logic or support. The hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
Hornchurch queries the logic behind them, and the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre should take that seriously. Clearly, there is no unanimity, even in the Labour party.<br><br>
We shall undoubtedly want to return to the issue. I suspect that when the clause is debated in another place, many concerns will be expressed by peers who take the Government Whip. I have no doubt that much concern will also be expressed by Cross-Bench peers, bishops, Liberal Democrat peers and Conservative peers. I shall be surprised if the Government can pursue the proposals all the way through. I think that they will, in the end, decide that they were wrong to put the clause in a criminal justice Bill. We shall probably find that a deal was done in a smoke-filled room between the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Home Secretary. The Secretary of State will have said, "Just give me something that I can say so that I can appear tough to parents. Put something in a criminal justice Bill to make me sound as if we are doing something serious about truancy." However, in the end, the deal made in that smoke-filled room will come unstuck and the Government will decide that this is the wrong Bill in which to put such a clause. It is the wrong kind of provision and achieves nothing. I very much hope that the Government will think better of including it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to dispel the image of macho, smoke-filled rooms that the hon. Gentleman has conjured up, but his contribution has not helped matters. The hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch made serious points, which I shall try to address.<br><br>
First, however, I should make it clear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said, that the clause is but one of a range of responses. We heard an interesting contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who has dealt professionally with parents and young people in such circumstances. As a lawyer, I have sat in juvenile courts with a forlorn youngster who is all on his own because mum or dad simply could not be bothered to turn up, often without an excuse. There was no way in which the court, social services or education felt sufficiently empowered to bring home to the parents of the forlorn youngster sitting in front of the bench the seriousness of their failure to turn up.<br><br>
It must be appreciated that we may be dealing with damaged, difficult and deprived families and circumstances. I have every confidence that magistrates will take a common-sense, practical view that will reflect the anxieties that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre outlined while reflecting the anxieties about chaotic lifestyles that the hon. Member for Taunton and my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch echoed.<br><br>
It is a question of achieving a balance in a legal framework that makes absolutely clear the seriousness of attendance at school and court when such attendance has not been forthcoming or when a young person brings himself to the attention of the juvenile court for some other reason and education and parental involvement are an issue but the parents are nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to parents who show no concern or care for their children and do not even bother to turn up to court. What research has he done and what evidence does he have that shows that making the fine £2,500 instead of leaving it at its present level will make a miraculous difference to those parents? Has he examined whether £5,000 would be better? What is the penalty and what evidence does he have to show which penalty will work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady does not do herself or her cause any justice by talking in terms of miraculous changes. We are discussing not miraculous changes but challenging a culture that tolerates the absence of children from school and reflects the serious impact that truancy can have on a child's future prospects in life. It is a difficult business and requires several interventions. It is untrue to suggest, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath did, that the increase is merely macho posturing.<br><br>
The first issue that the social exclusion unit examined was the impact of a child's absence from school and how to ensure that children are not excluded from schools by the action of the school. When children do not meet expectations of their academic or behavioural performance in a school context, a variety of interventions from a variety of sources should be available to strengthen the engagement of the child with the school and of the parent with the child and the school. That was just one response; there were many others. The hon. Member for Taunton refers to work being done on parenting to support parents as a result of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.<br><br>
The provision should be in a criminal justice Bill, because it relates to a level of fine and the involvement of the criminal justice system in cases of failure to attend school. It properly belongs in a criminal justice measure and is an example of joined-up thinking. That is what it is. I see a certain amount of scepticism on the part of one sedentary latecomer to this Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I forgive the hon. Gentleman. However, I detected a certain amount of scepticism about it being an example of joined-up thinking. Let me give a practical example that I have seen for myself in Newham. The police, social services, and education welfare go out together on the streets of Newham identifying children and young people who are not at school when they should be. There is then a concerted follow-up between police, education and social services in order to do something about it. This measure is about ensuring that we underpin that with an appropriate maximum fine.<br><br>
It is important to stress that by making the offence imprisonable in this way, it allows the court to issue a warrant for the arrest of the parent who fails to turn up when required to do so. It is not, therefore, a question of simply locking up people. That would occur in only the most exceptional cases. It is a question of underpinning the significance and importance of a child's attendance at school, and the failure to secure it and to take an interest. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead points out, as many as 80 per cent. of parents do not bother to attend court in the first place. By making the offence imprisonable, we are ensuring that parents are required to attend court or risk arrest. It is designed to support good parenting. It is designed to support early intervention, to encourage a joined-up approach between police, social services and education, and to underpin that as appropriate with the criminal law. It is for that reason that I commend the clause, unamended, to the Committee.</span></p>
