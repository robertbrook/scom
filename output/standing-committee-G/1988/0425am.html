	<p>New clause 10—	<i>Approval of applications to provide certain facilities for the disabled.</i></p>
	<p>Government amendments Nos. 580 and 581.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 90 provides for the payment of grants and awarding costs for repair work for the provision of dwellings by conversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 10 introduces a specific disabled facilities grant for adaptations required by a disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 571 to 573 insert references to the grant into clause 90, which provides for the various types of grant available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 574 provides that the normal requirement that a property should be at least 10 years old does not apply in the case of disabled facilities grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 575 specifies the type of interest in the property an applicant who is a tenant must have to be eligible for the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 576 permits tenants to apply for disabled facilities grants whether or not they have a repairing obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 577 to 579 amend clause 94 to cater for disabled facilities grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 580 inserts a reference to this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1014</span>
grant into clause 104. When a certificate of intended letting is provided with a grant application, letting conditions will be imposed in the same way as they will be for renovation grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 581 inserts a definition of disabled person into the list of definitions in clause 116. The definition is that used in new clause 10(5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister has received a letter from The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation, which draws attention to areas of concern, and particularly the wording of new clause 10. The letter asks the Minister to reconsider the wording in the new clause now that grants are to be given. Is the Minister aware of that letter, and will he assist the disabled by removing the negative wording in the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the letter, but I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) will pick up a number of its points and that he may possibly share the views expressed by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). When I have heard the concerns voiced in that letter, perhaps I shall be able to make a positive response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by saying how much people who are concerned about the disabled welcome new clause 10? It makes a dramatic change to the eligibility of disabled people to receive improvement grants, which is widely welcomed. When the Bill originally came before the Committee, renovation grants were mandatory. However, all other grants, including those for adaptations for disabled people, were discretionary. That was considered unsatisfactory by disabled people, who rightly argued that the special nature of essential adaptations for them should be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy is to make houses fit for able-bodied people but that does not necessarily mean that they will be fit for disabled people. New clause 10 recognises that. It answers many of the fears expressed on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam)—and some of my own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) touched on a couple of points in the new clause. It shows a preference for double negatives. Subsection (1) states that a housing authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall not approve an application … unless"</p></blockquote>
It could have stated that an authority could approve an application "if it is satisfied". I wonder why such tortuous wording was chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(c) provides eligibility for a grant for access to a room that can be used as a bedroom. I suppose that means that if a disabled person decides to change a sitting room on the ground floor into a bedroom, he should be given a grant for it. I understand that. But if that happened, everyone else in the home would be deprived of the use of a sitting room. I wonder why eligibility for an extension cannot be changed to include the bedroom. Possible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1015</span>
relevant wording in that case might be, "or providing for the disabled occupant, a room used, or suitable for, sleeping."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(g) seems a little restrictive. Surely a disabled person needs to have access to, and to be able to move around, a building for his own sake, not only to look after a dependent relative. I wonder why the provision is restricted to a relative. Many people have friends caring for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other adaptations could be covered by a mandatory grant—for example, for disabled people who may need slightly different heating and lighting systems to make their property comfortable. At present, these systems are not covered by a mandatory grant; nor are adequate thermal insulation, double glazing and draughtproofing, or access to a garage or covered carport if a disabled person is dependent upon a road or pavement vehicle for mobility outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we greatly welcome the change in Government philosophy and the introduction of a user-friendly approach, the Government may care to reflect upon one or two further improvements between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the earlier amendments have been rendered redundant by new clause 10. All I want from my hon. Friend the Minister is an undertaking that he will reflect upon some of the more detailed points raised by the Association of Disabled Professionals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the fact that the amendments include disabled people in the part of the Bill relating to grants. We would prefer the matter to be resolved on a consensus view, instead of hon. Members trying to score points on the various issues involved in programmes for the disabled. Against that background, I suggest that the letter which some hon. Members, although not the Minister, have received is of some value, because it contains the observations of people who are nearest to the disabled and who care for them in many ways and make representations on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues were highlighted in detail by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who clearly takes the same view as the letter's author. We share that view. We ask the Minister to consider carefully the valuable issues raised in the letter from the Association of Disabled Professionals. It would be wrong to agree to the clause without taking into consideration the observations made to us. It would be in the interests of everyone, especially the disabled and our constituents, who rely upon us to express our views here, if the finer points of the letter could be considered and included in the Bill, to benefit those most in need. If the Minister accepted those points, the measure could be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) spoke to his amendments and the speech made by the hon. Member for Normanton. I am grateful for what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton said about new clause 10 and how we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1016</span>
have tried to meet the concerns of disabled people with regard to home improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench have had sight of the letter. I yield to no one in my admiration for RADAR. As a Back Bencher, I was an active member of the all-party disablement committee under the chairmanship of the right hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley). I am sure that I will have the highest regard for the new director, George Wilson, although I do not know him that well now. It would have been helpful if we had received a copy of the letter before today's sitting, as I may have been able to meet some of the concerns that are expressed in it head on. As it is, I shall have to take many of them away and consider them in detail. I am prepared to meet some principal concerns which were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the amendments are defective. My hon. Friend seeks to correct what he describes as double negatives. The purpose behind amendments No. 582 and 584 appears to be to make grant mandatory for works required to make a property fit for a disabled occupant. I understand that, but amendment no. 583 requires an authority to give mandatory grant if the proposed works would leave the property
	<br><blockquote><p>"not fit for the disabled occupant".</p></blockquote>
I cannot believe that that is his intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adaptations for disabled people are a special case. The normal requirements associated with renovation grants will not be appropriate. In particular, the fitness standard alone is not an adequate yardstick for eligibility for mandatory grant. Therefore, new clause 10 makes express provision for a disabled facilities grant and specifies the circumstances in which the grant is to be mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mandatory grant would be available for works required to enable a disabled occupant to have access to and around a house, to use lighting and heating controls and to provide or adapt basic amenities such as a WC or bath. In addition, discretionary grant would be available for other works necessary to make a property suitable for the accommodation, welfare or employment of a disabled occupant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before approving either mandatory or discretionary grant, an authority must be satisfied, having consulted the social services authorities, that the proposed works are necessary and appropriate for the needs of the disabled occupant. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton accepts that, which may mean that, when I have considered Mr. Wilson's letter more carefully, I might not be able to meet completely the concerns expressed in paragraph 4 of the letter. The authorities must be satisfied that it is reasonable and practicable to carry out the works, having regard to the condition of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the age of the property, but more pertinent is the fact that it would be inappropriate to give a grant if a property was unstable or the proposed works would make it so. There is no way in which my right hon. Friend would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1017</span>
support that proposal, so there would have to be discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my brief reading of the letter, it seems that RADAR is anxious to remove as far as it can the word "discretion" at all levels. I have undertaken to consider the proposal, but surely discretion should be retained in the circumstances that I cited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cites the example of premises which, because of their condition, would not, in many people's opinion, be worthy of a grant. That is the extreme—the exception. For the Minister to say that because of that one exception the reference in the letter to discretion should not be considered is a little short-sighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the proposal. Members of the Committee accept that the Minister and his advisers have not had much time to digest the arguments in the letter, but it contains very little at which he can take offence. Before he makes a final decision on discretion, I ask him to give it further thought. The proposal will be of value to those involved, and is made not to wreck the new clause but to strengthen it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's description of the letter is accurate. It is in no way offensive—quite the reverse. It is generous to the Government for introducing new clause 10, under which a wider range of housing adaptations for disabled people will attract the grant available under the clause. I have no difficulty with the letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some difficulty, however, with the hon. Gentleman's statement that my example is the exception. I do not wish to pursue the issue much further at this stage. I think that my example is still a good one, and such exemptions may well have to be covered in the legislation. None the less, if my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton will withdraw his amendments, I undertake to honour my undertaking to study the proposals in RADAR's letter and to return to them later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. In addition to reading the letter from George Wilson, the director of RADAR, will he also read a similar letter from Peter Large, the chairman of the Association of Disabled Professionals, on the same subject?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, unlike other changes to a building, adaptations needed by disabled people do not necessarily add to the value of a house. Quite often they do the reverse, so these grants are in a different category. Secondly, much of what we are discussing is essential if a disabled person is to live in the community. Thirdly, some of the work is carried out not for the benefit of the householder but for the benefit of someone else who lives in the home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these three reasons, these grants should be in a category separate from ordinary, run-of-the-mill improvement grants. Disabled people do not want treatment that cannot be justified. They do not want to be considered as a totally different case. They want only to get to the starting post at the same time
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1018</span>
as everyone else. New clause 10 will be enormously helpful, and in the light of undertakings I shall not press my amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 572, in page 81, line 42, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (c) a grant for the provision of facilities for a disabled person in a dwelling is referred to as a 'disabled facilities grant'.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 573, in page 81, line 44, leave out "either" and insert "any".—[	<i>Mr. Trippier.</i>]</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 321, in page 81, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Every local housing authority responsible for determining entitlement to renovation grants—
	<ol>
	<li>shall take such steps as appear necessary for the purpose of securing that persons who may be entitled to grants from the authority become aware that they may be entitled to them; and</li>
	<li>shall make copies of the grant scheme, with any local policies adopted by it in relation to the award or administration of the scheme, available for public inspection at their principal offices at all reasonable hours without payment."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
I hope that the amendment will speak for itself—it will have to because I cannot find the briefing note. The admendment requires local authorities to ensure that people know that grants are available when the new regime comes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, we had a brief debate about publicity. This is an attempt to ensure that local authorities take proper steps to see that people who are entitled to grants are made aware of that fact, and that they make copies of the grant scheme available to people who express an interest. It is also an attempt to ensure that information about local policies on housing action areas, for example, is made available at reasonable hours in local authority offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us, I think, are committed to the principle of the full take-up of grants that are available. Tto that end, the amendment writes into the Bill an obligation to ensure that people know about renovation grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that it is necessary and desirable widely to publicise details of grants that are available and local policies in that regard, but I question whether it is necessary to introduce a statutory duty into the Bill. Our aim, in the reform of the grant system, is to direct assistance to those who most need it, and we recognise that proper publicity will be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department will issue a booklet which describes the new system, and it will send copies to local authorities for distribution. The advisory services provided for in clause 131 will also have a significant role in publicising grant availability, as will the agencies already active in promoting repairs to homes of elderly people. Furthermore, it is intrinsic in the effective administration of the grant system that local authorities should make details readily available, if only to minimise the number of abortive applications. The creation of a specific duty to publicise therefore seems superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1019</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the Minister's reply carefully, and I welcome the idea of having a specific reference in the Bill to a grant for disabled people, but other issues are involved. I have in mind the Housing Defects Act 1984, because some disabled people may live in defective properties that are not covered by the existing legislation. There is targeting on the special needs of some disabled people. When he is considering the leaflets that are to be published, perhaps the Minister will have regard to the Housing Defects Act and its application to disabled people who need help, and make provision in the Bill to embrace people who live in properties that are affected by that Act. I hope that the Minister will do that, because it is an important issue and I have constituents who are affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman has constituents in that situation, and I have every sympathy with them, but I hope that he will forgive me if I strenuously resist the incorporation of any form of literature on housing defects legislation in anything to do with housing improvement grants. I say that because the legislation is entirely separate. I can think of nothing that could lull some of his constituents, my constituents or anyone else's constituents into a falser sense of security than the assumption that, because they live in a home which they consider defective, they qualify for help under the Housing Defects Act or for housing improvement grants—the subject of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware—I have day-to-day responsibility for it—and so is the hon. Member for Normanton, that the Housing Defects Act 1984 is tightly drawn. The Government must accept that a particular house qualifies under that legislation. I seek to convince the hon. Gentleman that what he proposes would be incredibly confusing. However, I am prepared to ensure that the specific legislation on housing defects is separate and available for those who qualify. I shall study that legislation when I return to my Department to ensure, as far as I am able, that the hon. Gentleman's anxieties are allayed. I ask him not to press me further to incorporate it in the Bill, because it is entirely separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have responded to the specific points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, but he will know that as a result of recent legislation we are prepared to go further. There are now statutory duties that did not exist some time ago. The Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985 provides for the deliberations of local authority committees to be made public, except in limited circumstances. Copies of agendas, reports considered at meetings and so on are also to be available. I give my hon. Friend an undertaking that we are prepared to publish a booklet which would be easily accessible and would make clear their entitlement to people who fall into the category that he described. In the circumstances, I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now found the briefing from the Institute of Housing. I could not have made my case more effectively if I had found it before.

It is clear that there will be publicity for the new regime, and local Members of Parliament will do what we can to ensure that those who are eligible know about the scheme and how to pursue it. Will the Minister confirm that there are no plans to introduce charges for obtaining the application forms or for filling them in? If he can give me that I assurance, I shall be delighted to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 590, in page 82, line 1, leave out subsection (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendment No. 608.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to the part of the Bill that deals with restrictions on organisations that can carry out work on behalf of people who qualify for grants and may wish the local authority to carry out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation denies them choice. Part XV of the Housing Act 1985 allows local authorities and other organisations to carry out the work and qualify for payment out of the grant for it. The amendment proposes that subsection (3) should be removed to allow the existing legislation to continue. Discussion on new clause 10 and previous amendments strengthens our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing legislation provides that local authorities may, in agreement with the recipients of grant, carry out any work that is eligible for grant under part XV of the 1985 Act and any further work that is necessary or desirable outside the grant provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Government want to remove this provision? Why is subsection (3) included in the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 90(3) repeals the right of individuals in receipt of grant to have their improvements or repairs carried out by the local authority. The clause is targeted on the disabled and many people would qualify for grant under it. The local autority is best qualified to give advice to people applying for a grant who wish to make arrangements for a survey of their premises and to draw up plans and submit quotations. The local authority has the appropriate services and contacts with the disabled. I cannot understand why the Government wish to prevent local authorities giving that service, especially to those who are disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection would prevent local authorities and other bodies from carrying out work requested by individuals, and that is a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission has said that local authorities respond positively to the Local Government Act 1988 in carrying out necessary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1021</span>
repairs. That Act insisted that work carried out by local authorities' direct works organisations should give value for money. Local authorities are geared to offering value for money and they provide a comprehensive service including surveying, tendering and advice to people who qualify for a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from the Audit Commission press release on 12 January:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Controller of the Audit Commission, Howard Davies, said, 'The Audit Commission believes that local authority service shoudl be subjected to the market place and we support competition as a matter of principle."</p></blockquote>
If the provision under which local authorities offer services and give advice is removed, the spirit referred to in that press release will also be removed. The spirit of competition will be denied to those who quality for grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment, when the Minister may perhaps respond to the following point. The public works organisations of local authorities comply with the recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Commission. Under Section 71 of the Local Government Act 1988, equal opportunity policies apply to local authorities, so a greater principle is established in the public works sector than in many private sector organisations. That is an important reason why local authorities should be allowed to continue to tender and to provide this service for people who qualify for grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only because I know the hon. Gentleman to be a reasonable man that I intervene before he proceeds further. I agree with everything that he has said so far, but if he were to address the Committee for much longer it would be painful for me to have to point out to him that all his points are covered in clause 113. I appreciate, Mr. Hunt, that we have not yet reached that provision, but it meets the hon. Gentleman's fears in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To allow the hon. Gentleman time to read clause 113, I may add that if he wishes to develop his argument on equal opportunities, I shall understand and try to respond. The subject is not specifically included by the Bill, but it might covered by legislation for which other Departments are responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No grant is payable under this Part where the proposed works are to be carried out by—
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) a local authority".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that clause 113 supersedes this provision and that local authorities would be eligible to carry out the work, to receive grant and to give a comprehensive service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, why will local authorities and other public authorities no longer be allowed to carry out public works for individuals in receipt of grants under part VIII? The Minister may say, "You are reading it wrong." Local authorities and public works departments—my local authority has an extremely well managed public works department—have been doing much of this work,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1022</span>
and I should be aggrieved if they were denied the chance to continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that there is no cause for concern and that local authorities can continue to provide the service, I shall be satisfied. However, will he explain why the clause is in this form if it is not intended to apply as written? If the Minister's explanation is satisfactory, we can move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly reasonable for the hon. Member for Normanton to raise the issue. I draw his attention to Government amendment No. 608. It is a technical amendment and was tabled precisely because of a possible misunderstanding of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As clause 90(3) stands, it could be interpreted to exclude payment of grant when the proposed works are carried out by a local authority under clause 113 on behalf of a grant applicant. Our intention is that the grant should not be payable only when the proposed works are for the benefit of one of the bodies listed—for example, because a local authority owns the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for Normanton said that under the subsection the Government appear to be removing a provision that has existed for some time. That is not the case. The matter is covered later in the Bill; if our amendment is accepted, it will meet his fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that without the Government amendment there would be conflict between clause 90(3) and clause 113?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot make my answer any clearer. If we had not tabled our amendment, the provision might have been interpreted as the hon. Member for Normanton said. All that is needed to bring all this together is acceptance of the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the provision mean that grant will not be paid if the local authority owns the house? When subsection (3) says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"No grant is payable under this Part where the proposed works are to be carried out by—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) a local authority",</p></blockquote>
does it mean that grants are not payable for works that local authorities carry out to their own properties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has largely explained the interpretation of the clause. May we take it that if private owners of property that qualifies for a grant asked the local authority to carry out the work and to provide the services, the authority would qualify for payment under the grant scheme as it does at present under the Housing Act 1985?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton is straying from his original question. Clause 113 is entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power of local housing authority to carry out works which would attract grant."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1023</span>
Amendment No. 590 would allow the other public bodies listed in the provision to attract grant, which is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public bodies, including local authorities, have their own means of attracting improvement grants of one kind or another. Money can be made available through projects such as the housing investment programme, estate action or the community refurbishment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be dreadful if the amendment were accepted, although perhaps now the hon. Gentleman is not minded to press it to a Division. Under the amendment, the public sector would be competing with the grants made available specifically for those of his constituents who are in private accommodation and who badly need this form of assistance. There would be direct conflict between the grant systems of the private sector and the usual grant mechanisms of delivering money to local authorities for improving their stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that under the housing investment programme there will be a separate budget for grants to private tenants and home owners who apply for grants? At present, the money for grants is set against HIP, and in practice people are sometimes competing for resources with local authorities. That is why grants dry up, and, when schemes have been programmed, local authorities have not been able to maximise their grant payments. If they paid out all their money in grants, they would have nothing left in their HIPs for other works. Is that not the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the housing investment programme is targeted specifically at public stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It never has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: HIP is made available for local authorities to deal primarily with public stock in their ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ. The Minister may find that that is not whan has happened. Perhaps later in the debate I shall give him the facts and figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing action areas and general improvement areas tackled in the inner cities have been not mass council estates but back-to-back terraced housing. Enveloping is one such scheme. The costs of these ancillary works come out of HIP. There have always been two halves—the council estate programme, and the improvement works and renewal strategies programmes. Does the Minister not realise that they come out of the same budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do, but HIP is targeted primarily at public stock. The money made available for some of the schemes to which I referred is a form of top-slicing from HIP. It is up to a local authority to make available the amount of money that it sees fit for improvement in both the public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1024</span>
Money for housing renewal areas, which we discussed last week, will be available from the HIP allocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am finding the debate difficult to follow. Is the Minister saying that amendment No. 608 so alters clause 90(3) that it is no longer in conflict with clause 113? I do not see how, because the amendment would leave out of clause 90(3),
	<br><blockquote><p>"proposed works are to be carried out",</p></blockquote>
and insert,
	<br><blockquote><p>"improvement, repair or provision is to be".</p></blockquote>
I do not see how it makes any difference. Perhaps the Minister can assist—I am confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The hon. Member for Normanton had the answer in his opening remarks. He correctly said that the previous legislation—the Housing Act 1985—adequately covered that point. His concern was that the Bill did not cover it. Therefore, the hon. Members for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and for Normanton are both correct. As a result of the Government amendment, the Bill will now read virtually word for word as did the previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the Government amendment, the hon. Gentleman would have been absolutely right and probably would have wanted to press his amendment to a vote, but as I explained to him, his amendment is entirely defective because it would have the exact opposite effect to what he intended. It would mean that people in the public sector would compete unfairly with people in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West is absolutely right. That is why we have to have this Government amendment, which brings the Bill into line with the 1985 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I am concerned that, under clause 90(3), the facilities provided under clause 514, in part XV, of the Housing Act 1985, would be withdrawn. The Minister now says that that will not happen and that the facilities available to public works departments of local authorities will continue. I thank him for that clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second query concerns the disabled. It arises out of the Minister's comments on housing investment programme allocation. The Wakefield local authority used to apportion a part of the HIP to grants to repair, improve or bring up to standard houses in the private sector. It had to assess the number of applications for such grants and budget to meet the demands of private owners. It never had sufficient money to meet all the requests for grants throughout the lifetime of the HIP, and it is still the same—there are more applicants for grants than there are resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Peterlee, 500 people bought houses which are now defective, but they do not qualify for grant under the Housing Defects Act 1984. Many of us have received letters about the issue. Will disabled people who live in those houses be given assistance under the Bill? Will structural defects in their property have to be remedied before they can apply for a grant to adapt their houses to meet their needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1025</span>
Quite a few of my constituents are in this position. The Housing Defects Act 1984 does not cover their property, which we say should be covered by the Bill. The question about grants is important, and the Minister should consider it. He should think carefully because the HIP allocation has been cut and cut again and insufficient resources are now available. Will the Minister tell us how that will affect grants to the disabled, if the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to go down the path the hon. Gentleman wishes to lead me and deal with housing defect legislation, we could be here for hours. The hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) understands—I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman does not—that housing defect legislation means that specific grants are available for qualifying defects. For a home to qualify for assistance, a major consideration is the view of the building research establishment, which is a responsibility of the Department of the Environment. I deal with such matters on a weekly basis. If a house qualified under the legislation, specific assistance would be available. If a house were in the private sector, assistance would be given to the private individual. If a house were in the public sector, money would be made available to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking not about housing defects legislation, but about housing improvement grants and the thousands of homes in the private sector which are not in such a bad condition, or unstable enough to qualify under housing defects legislation. Nevertheless, they still need assistance and no one disagrees with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I have found the appropriate clause in the 1985 legislation, I shall try to make a comparison between it and the Bill. I refer the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) to section 460(3) of the Housing Act 1985 which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The grants are not payable where the provision, improvement or repair is by"</p></blockquote>
three categories, which are listed. We have lengthened the list to include:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a local authority, a new town corporation, or the Development Board for Rural Wales."</p></blockquote>
The additions we have made are listed in clause 90. We have included "an urban development corporation" because, although two existed in 1981, they were not involved with housing, and "a housing action trust" because such trusts result from recent Government legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the whole issue hinges on a word. The legislation is constructed in such a way, including amendment No. 608, that it still looks as though a local authority cannot carry out improvement work on property that is owned by someone other than the local authority. The Minister is saying that no grant is payable to a local authority for carrying out work on its property, but that a lcoal authority can carry out work that attracts grant on a propery belonging to someone else. My point is that if we include amendment No. 608 in clause 90(3) the legislation will read:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1026</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"No grant is payable under this Part where improvement, repair or provision is to be by—(a) a local authority".</p></blockquote>
That still sounds as though a local authority cannot carry out work on behalf of somebody else. The words "on behalf of" would be better than "by". We believe that the clause, as drafted, will not allow a local authority to carry out work on someone else's property where a grant is payable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Gentleman's case fairly compelling. All he is saying is that there is still a degree of ambiguity in the clause despite the Government amendment. My answer is that it does not matter because the issue is cleared up in clause 113 which overrides it. I would not be fair to the hon Gentleman if I did not undertake to look again at clause 90 and amendment No. 608 to see if I can remove all forms of ambiguity. However, I still stand by what I said that clause 113 clears up the matter. The Government do not want to create confusion in anyone's mind by leaving the legislation ambiguous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Plumbing. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) will remember exchanges on that front during his erstwhile role. I shall not talk about plumbing today except in the general context of building. However, I am prepared to give quotations later to interested colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cowboy builder causes extreme suffering and hardship. The Department of the Environment set up a working party in 1987 to look at the problem, specifically at the behest of the construction industry, and published its report last July together with the Government's response to the 10 recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three main recommendations in the report were first, that the Office of Fair Trading should develop criteria against which guarantee schemes for small building works can be assessed and approved; secondly, that once a guarantee scheme assessment and approval system is in operation, local authorities should be required to ensure that work carried out using home improvement grants is done by a builder who provides an approved insurance backed guarantee; and thirdly, that financial institutions should strongly recommend that the householder borrowing money for small building work uses a builder with an approved insurance-backed guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guarantees must have insurance backing. It is self-evident that a guarantee has no value if the undertaking goes into liquidation or bankruptcy. The force of law is no protection against cowboys. Customers first have to find them and then authorities have to find them. Many are capable of closing down and opening a near-identical business the following week. That is a major problem that bedevils the building industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of local authority grant work, there is a need to provide value for money without the additional costs involved in correcting bad workmanship at the expense of the ratepayer. Several local authorities already strongly recommend, and some insist, that builders used must provide an insurance-backed guarantee or warranty for grant works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More interestingly, last year the Northern Ireland Housing Executive acted to curb cowboy builders. It insisted that from 21 March 1988, new grant applicants for improvement or conversion grants would have to use contractors who are members of a recognised insurance-backed guarantee scheme. The Housing Executive's press release said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Grant Aided work, like any other building activity, has sometimes in the past been subject to criticism of for example poor workmanship and the guarantee schemes are intended to help overcome difficulties encountered by some applicants. The Executive will not be recommending any particular scheme or indeed any builder. However, by introducing this policy it is intended to give protection to both the grants applicant and the builder."</p></blockquote>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I put to my hon. Friend the Minister echoes the view of the Building Employers Confederation—the sponsor of the amendment and on whose behalf I speak. If the problem in Northern
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1028</span>
Ireland is sufficient to require such a remedy, surely there should be a similar scheme with similar requirements and guarantees in the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to deal with the problem of cowboy operators. I have here a document issued by the Building Employers Confederation which cites some of the experiences of citizens advice bureaux. It describes what happens to old people who are gullible, trusting and easily parted from their life's savings by cowboy builders. Such people go to citizens advice bureaux for advice when someone with a van and a ladder has done work for them—perhaps to the roof or some other part of the house that cannot readily be inspected. They have additional expense, and realise that they have been taken for a ride by some cowboy operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the view that the Government should make provision in this legislation to get rid of cowboy operators. Public works departments can still carry out repairs and improvements, and the grants system helps to ensure that cowboy operators cannot thrive, but it does not go far enough. In previous debates about urban development corporations I have said that we need tighter legislation to get rid of cowboy operators, whose numbers have increased over the past few years as a result of people being encouraged to start their own businesses. A person with a van and a ladder masquerades behind all kinds of promises to people who are looking for someone to carry out repairs to their property. There are big-time cowboy operators as well as small-time ones, and the Government should do something to stop them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept that the standard of workmanship of some contractors is not good, nor are the guarantees that they give, but it is difficult to know how to deal with the problem.

Several proposals to deal with cowboy operators have been put to the Government. There is no scheme that will catch all cowboy operators in its net, because there are always some bright boys who manage to slip through, but at present there is no

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1029</span>
legislation to control such people, and there is no form of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) has told us what happens in Northern Ireland, where the Housing Executive has taken steps to try to curtail cowboy operations. One way of doing that is to make sure that there is an insurance guarantee back-up. Cowboys go round potential customers and say, "Because we have bought materials cheap and we have made a bargain, we can do the job without charging VAT." It is an incentive for people to employ them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about something that happens occasionally in a person's life—perhaps once every 10 or 15 years. Obviously, if it were a service or goods that the person bought every other month, there would be the remedy of going elsewhere, but here we are talking about the person who is conned into spending a fairly large sum to remedy something that will not occur again for another 15 years or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point. People part with money, usually a substantial sum—hundreds of pounds, in many instances—and once it has been paid they realise that they have not had value for money. When that happens, local authorities are best able to help, because they are in touch with all the builders. Certainly in Wakefield, many builders tender for and obtain work with the local authority, and a judgment is formed about their work. Local authorities exercise building controls, and their clerks of works monitor the work that is done by contractors on behalf of the housing departments. The machinery is there, if the Government want to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, therefore, that the Government take the amendments seriously and consult local government on how best to introduce provisions to control some of the operators in the black economy—the cowboy operators who take many of our constituents for a ride when they do building work and repairs for them. There is an urgent need to do something about the problem, because the number of cowboy operators is growing. The Minister should consider what has been said and do something about the problem by targeting legislation on cowboys, builders and trades people who take advantage of many of our constituents who need repair work to their properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) for attempting to outline that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a member of the Chartered Institute of Building, I know that for some time it tried to introduce chartered builders. The Government in their wisdom decided that labour-only subcontractors should have a certificate 715. I hardly feel that local authorities are competent to give certificates of competence. I realise that there will always be people who, to make a quick buck, will undercut prices. The Institute of Plumbing tried to ensure that only its members could install central heating systems, but got nowhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1030</span>
The idea of having work done and not paying VAT is an incentive to many. Even among contracting firms of differing sizes there is a variation in the standard of work. I recall advertising for a bricklayer. When I saw his work, I thought that it looked more like plastering, so I said to him, "You are not a bricklayer", and he replied, "No, sir, I am a plasterer."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that such people are trained, but, sadly, building skills are changing. There was a time when, painstakingly, I soldered a plumbing joint. Now, it is a case of "you, a friend and a spanner" doing much of the work because it has been simplified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an increase in do-it-yourself work. It is possible to visit one of the larger builders' merchants and buy virtually anything to build anything from a rabbit hutch to a castle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to my hon. Friend with interest because he speaks from considerable experience. Will he comment on the decrease in the number of trained people going into the industry, which may be partly because people can earn money for fairly unskilled work? Does he agree that, in addition to shoddy workmanship, sometimes there is actual danger to the public or to public health, depending on what has been done, and that we should try to do something about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept everything that my hon. Friend says. There is a skill shortage. When I look round Rooms in the House, I have thought, "I wonder whether there are joiners, carpenters and cabinet makers who can do work such as this today", and the answer is yes. The next question is, "Would anyone want a roof made like this one?" I suppose that there must be people who would. I doubt whether a person who possessed such skills would spend his time working on a building site erecting roos with a clause hammer and 6 in nails. The aptutide and skills still exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the do-it-yourself trade springing up and because there is no indemnity or certificate of competence for the person doing the work the only way to discover how good people are is by inspecting their work as I did with the pasterer who did the bricklaying. Local authorities are not a vehicle for that. One is seeking the seed corn of the larger contractors, such as Wimpey and Henry Boot. They started off in a manner not dissimilar to that described by the hon. Member for Normanton—with a barrow, or, in those days, perhaps a horse and cart, and they gradually worked their way up to their present standard of competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issuing of a certificate of competence is a laudable idea which would help outlaw cowboy building, but will it need a massive bureaucracy? How would a local authority act? As the hon. Member for Normanton said, a contract would fill in a form stating that he wished to be considered for contracts within a certain price range. He would have to give a surety. Contractors are not paid by local authorities. There are also retentions. I have discovered that a contractor who goes to a person's house and executes work has to be paid cash in hand because the only other way to obtain payment is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1031</span>
through litigation, as the owner has possession of the property. When I built houses, I learnt that it was important to ensure that keys were not handed over until money was paid. It is no secret that many times I had to change locks because keys went missing and people could move in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that cowboy builders should be outlawed. I accept also that those who state that they are craftsmen are really odd-job men who pass themselves off as craftsmen. I cannot see a way to eliminate the problem. Perhaps the only way would be to close down all do-it-yourself shops. There is a shortage of craftsmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect the experience that my hon. Friend brings to the Committee, but I think that he is exaggerating the aims of our amendment. We are not asking for local authorities to say that one company is well-run and does good work and that another is not. All we ask is that local authorities ask a company whether it has an insurance-backed guarantee scheme. That would not involve great local authority bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always obliged when my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton speaks because he gives answer reminiscent of those that he gave when he was a Minister. I picked up the point that the hon. Member for Normanton made when I asked how we would control these contractors. My hon. Friend immediately mentioned local authorities. I accept that one way would be to ask for a surety, but where do we lodge it? Is the Building Employers Confederation to be asked to issue a bond or a certificate? I question whether the Government should put themselves in the position of deciding who may or may not operate in the building industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People used to inquire of a person's bank whether that person was financially sound. He could be financially sound, but be a diabolical contractor. We know that a firm is only as good as its boss and its employees. Some large firms carry on business, but employees change. We accept that those at the top are the competent people. I support the claim by the Chartered Institute of Building that we need to reach the point of stating that a firm has a certain standard of competence and is capable of undertaking a certain type and quality of work, but I cannot think of a mechanism for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must begin by thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) for raising this important subject. It is worthy of serious debate and I realise that it is appropriate to discuss it in the context of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak with feeling on the subject because I have lived with it for a considerable time. I am the Minister with responsibility for the construction industry. My first task on going to the Department of the Environment was to meet members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is difficult for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1032</span>
	<i>Hansard</i> reporters to pick up the hon. Gentleman's words if he turns his back on the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met many members of the Department of the Environment working party examining the practices of cowboy builders, so I know that they are in no way unanimous about their findings, which they reported to the Department. I appreciate that he is putting forward the case lodged by the Building Employers Confederation—for which I have the highest regard—which is not necessarily the same case that would be advanced by the Federation of Master Builders. The BEC agreed to put forward a compromise document to the Department of the Environment to which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch said, the Government responsed. It must be said that the members of the "Beat the Cowboys" working party were not ecstatic about our response, but we were as fair as we could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing two broad categories of cowboys. Some are avoiding, or evading, taxation in whatever form, whether VAT or direct taxation through income tax, and others are incompetent at doing the work that they undertake. Some will fall into both categories. I was staggered to hear the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) say that there was a growing number of people in the first caregory. I do not know what the number is, nor does my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchruch, nor does the hon. Member for Normanton. The hon. Gentleman has no more idea than the man in the moon whether the number is growing or declining. If anyone had any idea of the number, it would be the Treasury, especially Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complaints from small firms suggest that the Treasury spends far too much time investigating whether small firms are infringing this, that and the other rule, instead of allowing them air to breathe and releasing them from being prisoners of their in-trays to get on with the job. Yet strangely, it has failed to find many of those individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in this House, there is a debate, which crosses all party lines, about whether the black economy, which has been referred to about four times in the debate, is necessarily bad. It cannot be assumed by everyone, least of all my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, that it is bad. I give no personal view on the matter, but plenty of hon. Members believe that the black economy can be a spawning ground for legitimate businesses. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) touched on that. Those who have read anything on the subject will know that the former President of the United States of America allowed people who had been operating in the black economy to come into the more formal economy without any form of penalty. Constituents of some hon. Members will cross that particular barrier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to my hon. Friend as he develops his thesis on the black economy. Would he make any distinction between using public and private money? We are talking about the use of public money. It is particularly incumbent on the Government to ensure that that is tightly controlled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1033</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with that. All organisations responsible for the disbursement of public money, whether taxpayers' or ratepayers' money, must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that any money being made available is used properly. However, I have difficulty over the case of a self-employed man who, just because he is not a member of the BEC or FMB or does not have an insurance-backed guarantee, is not allowed to do certain work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific small grants are available under the legislation which could be suitable for small builders. The vast majority of builders emply fewer than 20 people and I do not see why they should be prohibited in that way. The hon. Gentleman will find that not all medium to large firms are members of the BEC, and that not all small firms, employing around five people, are members of the FMB. The Government believe in deregulation, rather than increased regulation. They have done more than any other Government, including previous Conservative Governments, to stimulate the small firms sector and the self-employed. Will we deny people who, for example, have been set up under the enterprise allowance scheme, the chance to do this sort of work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's clear support for the black economy, I should like clarification of whether the interests of the consumer or those of the provider are to be seen as paramount. Whether people have redress, and whether there are standards that determine the quality of provision which are enforceable in a flexible and reasonable fashion are critical issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is unworthy of the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he listened carefully to what I said. I made it abundantly clear that I was not giving a personal view of whether I thought the black economy could be a spawning ground for legitimate businesses. I simply said that that happens in this country and in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard of companies who have moved from the illegitimate to the formal economy. I am not going to fall into the hon. Gentleman's trap. I have studied this subject for long enough—approximately six and a half years. If that is the only contribution that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside can make, perhaps he could stay out of the debate while I discuss the matter in sophisticated terms—as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch introduced the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is general agreement on the need to extend the choice of builders who are available to the customer and on the need to break down practices that restrict that choice, but not at the expense of undercutting unfairly, the reputable local builder. There is also a problem with those who seek to evade taxation. I am sure that there is hardly an hon. Member who has not been guilty of fostering the black economy by paying cash for work that has been done without a receipt. That is disreputable. Before we know where we are, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside will be on his feet saying that he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1034</span>
has not. This is not the simple subject that people suppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are small builders who strongly object to being forced to become members of a trade association. They may have had a disagreement with one of them, such as the BEC or FMB. I believe that if they were to get involved with any of those guarantee schemes, that would improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept all that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch has said on the subject. Such schemes would give enormous comfort to people who want work to be done, but I refuse to believe that the Office of Fair Trading should have a statutory duty—which it has said it does not want—or the job of policing such a scheme. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch will know, it has been very helpful and moved a darned sight further than I thought it would as a result of the report being commissioned. My hon. Friend may know that an OFT representative took part in the "cowboys" working party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sinks the BEC totally, I should say that local authorities employ the one-man contractor, the electrician or the plumber, who is not a member of any of those associations. However, because he is employed by a local. authority, he has to come up to certain standards and to give certain assurances. That is the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the black economy may be the spawning ground for some of the reputable industries. I can understand what he means when I look at some of the people in those industries. However, genuine contractors can be accepted and the best organisation to monitor them would be the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be some dispute about that but we should not discuss it not because it harks back to party III or IV, and who is most competent to judge or police such a scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch believes that it should be an organisation such as the OFT. The OFT was represented on the working party examining the practices of cowboy builders, and that organisation made it clear that it did not want to approve or police such people. The Committee should take note of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch that the guaranteed insurance schemes that he mentioned do not guarantee that work is done effectively and efficiently. That is a misunderstanding. It means that an individual who is a member of a trade association that has an insurance guaranteed scheme is effectively covered if work has to be done again. That is an important difference. My hon. Friend did not suggest otherwise, but that point has been missed out of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters is not whether a Bill offers a guarantee scheme but whether work is properly supervised at key stages when things can go wrong and might need to be put right. Supervision by technically qualified people acting on the customer's behalf is most important. We need to improve access
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1035</span>
to such help when the scale of the work suggests it. The services provided under clause 131 have an important role, especially for those unable to afford professional advice at commercial rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made it clear that our response to the working party was that guarantee schemes have an important role. However, despite the fact that we appreciate the work done by the BEC and the FMB in that regard, we must be able to distinguish between the various schemes and what they offer. We accept that the OFT has a role in developing the criteria and the OFT is prepared to accept that role, but it will not approve and police individual schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progress is being made, but it must be on a broad front. There must be a balance between the various interests and between choice and compulsion. The hon. Member for Normanton and I disagree fundamentally on that issue. The hon. Gentleman said, accurately, in an intervention that local authorities approve their tender lists in a certain way. He is right to suggest that no two authorities use the same mechanism or criteria for an approved list. I do not say that they necessarily should, but the way in which they organise their affairs should not be tacked on to the statute. If an insurance-backed guarantee scheme is to be marketed, it should not be by the Government on behalf of the BEC and FMB but by the BEC and FMB themselves. If their schemes are successful, that is fine. I believe that they are very competitive and that they can offer enormous comfort to people who ask for work to be done by a firm that belongs to either organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always been prepared to appear with the BEC and the FMB at regional conferences throughout the country to say how it is important for them to go for insurance-backed schemes, but to put such a provision on the face of the Bill would be unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend realise that insurance companies have a part to play and that they should be able to evolve, through an umbrella organisation, a form of insurance whereby they could start the ball rolling by saying, "These companies are warranted."? Is this not a case of the Office of Fair Trading and society saying, "This is the way forward that we require. The Government should keep their sticky little fingers out of it."?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last comment attracts me. I believe that more can be done by building trade associations. I am the first to compliment the BEC and the FMB on what they have already developed with insurance companies, although I am interested to know why they have not secured anything like 100 per cent. membership in the building sector that they both claim to represent. I am prepared to help them as much as I can, but not by force, compulsion or statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four times the Minister has suggested that I inferred that we should put the proposal on the face of the Bill. I said that the Minister should consult local authority associations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1036</span>
to see how the proposal could best be applied. It does not have to be on the face of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support local government and believe that it is doing a worthwhile job. I get the impression that Tory Members do not share our confidence in it. [Hon. Members: "Shame."] The Minister looks surprised, but I could develop that remark further if he wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should think carefully about the proposal and consult local authority associations. If the Government are determined to cut out the black economy, local authorities have experience that could help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for Normanton, I am dealing not only with his amendments but with all the other amendments on the amendment paper. The items that I referred to as being slapped on the face of the Bill and put in statute are contained in the other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is the same. We are prepared to discuss this and any other matter with local authority associations, but I have picked up what the hon. Member for Normanton said earlier about the way in which local authorities discharge their responsibilities in this regard. I have made it clear that, as long as the proposal does not contravene the Local Government Act 1988, I have no difficulty with it. The hon. Gentleman should welcome my response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other matters must be considered. First, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) referred to Northern Ireland, where the situation is very different, although the legal position is no different from that in England and Wales. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive cannot insist on grant work being carried out by a builder who provides guarantee schemes. That is the fact, and we must have it on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will understand that other factors in the Province require close supervision of building work from a security point of view. That is completely different from England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as I said earlier, we are introducing a minor works grant to help people, especially elderly people, to stay in their homes. The cost of the work will generally be below £1,000—a much smaller figure than that which would generally interest builders backed by the BEC, the FMB or by any form of insurance guarantee scheme. The amendments would rule out smaller builders and make it extremely difficult for them to undertake the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to give my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch an undertaking that I am as worried about the matter as he is, but I believe that the Government should not legislate on it and increase this form of bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Square</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has done the Committee a service with his lengthy and detailed reply, but he will be unsurprised if I remain sad about the cumulation of points that he made and the conclusion that he reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1037</span>
I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I shall make two points. Several times, my hon. Friend referred to the apparent necessity for builders to join this or that organisation. I did not see that consequence arising from my amendment, and even in the light of my hon. Friend's comments I do not see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not suggest that the OFT should monitor the scheme—simply that it should approve it in the first place. There are other ways of monitoring it. I judge that my hon. Friend will not accept the amendment and I do not feel inclined to press it to a Division. I can only hope that local authorities will increase their use of builders who use an insurance-backed scheme voluntarily if we cannot require it through legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with an issue that I raised on Second Reading. At present, people can get estimates from any contractor, submit them to a local authority and be awarded a grant. They can then go away and use a totally different contractor to do the work. Later, we shall discuss payment for the work, which provides some security, but it seems odd that people can obtain estimates from one group of contractors and then get someone else to carry out the work. The amendment would ensure that the work is done by a bona fide contractor who submits a written estimate that is scrutinised by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Bill does not make it a condition that the chap who does the work is the chap who puts in the estimate. The present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1038</span>
procedures give rise to a certain amount of dishonesty in that a contractor can see the estimate accepted by the local authority and then underbid it. Will my hon. Friend explain why the contractor who estimates is not the contractor who does the work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 630 and explain our interest in amendment No. 549.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate seems to relate to how we deal with public money, not to what we do as individuals. With amendment No. 630, we are anxious that people should get quality and value for money rather than simply the cheapest. People specify what they are doing, but they are not sophisticated enough to lay down contractual requirements for detailed standards. They may want to adjust their requirements to get a quality job and be less interested in getting the cheapest price. We accept the argument in amendment No. 549 about approval of the contractor who undertakes the job. Under our amendment, people would have a choice.

There has been a longstanding disagreement between both sides of the House about going for the cheapest price or a combination of the price for the job together with the quality and the standard to be applied. That relates to our debate because people are well aware that in dealing with not only their resources but with public money they want something that offers them a long-term standard of guarantee which would not be available if they accepted the lowest tender offered. In other words, people want the assurances and redress that we have debated this morning and we should allow them that advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly is news to me that there is dispute between the two sides of the House of Commons about whether the lowest tender should always be accepted, which is what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside, (Mr. Blunkett) suggested. It is widely understood that a local authority does not have to accept the lowest tender on grant works although one would expect an authority to have a good reason for accepting a higher tender. I am sure that the hon. Member for Brightside would agree with that.

We accept the reasonable presumption that the builder who provides an estimate carries out the work after a grant is approved, but if amendment No. 549 were accepted it would compel a grant applicant to use that builder even if he could not carry out the work because of other job commitments. If the applicant found a good builder who was willing and able to do the work at a lower price, or even at the same price, and do a better job, he could not use him. I am sure we have all come across that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an applicant went ahead with another builder and the work was completely satisfactory, it is hard to see on what grounds the authority might reasonably withhold grant. Although the principle behind amendment No. 549 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is understandable, far too many complications arise

Friend the Minister said, and I understand that circumstances may arise where another builder can do the job better and more cheaply and that it would be wrong to preclude him. I accept that. I am more concerned about collusion whereby a reputable builder provides an estimate and has it accepted by the local authority. It is then shown to a less reputable builder who says "I'll do it for less, chum", and who gets the contract. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister would not support that. I accept that my amendment goes too far in hitting the innocent as well as the less innocent and I shall reflect between now and on Report whether there is any way of hitting the right target as opposed to the slightly broader one.

	<div class='title'>THE AGE OF THE PROPERTY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 631, in page 82, line 31, leave out from "may" to end of line 38 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"entertain an application for a grant provided that all the conditions of this Part are met, notwithstanding the age of the property.".</p></blockquote>
The Minister may have inadvertently misled the Committee by suggesting that the wording in this section of the Bill is precisely the same as that in the Housing Act 1985. The Bill, as drafted, will remove from local authorities the discretion to set up programmes and break their programming powers to tackle, in particular, urban renewal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 631 seeks to amend the clause to make it read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A local housing authority may entertain an application for a grant provided that all the conditions of this Part are met, notwithstanding the age of the property."</p></blockquote>
At present, built into the Bill is the little phrase, "the relevant period". It may be 10 years, or some other period that the Secretary of State orders, but it will deprive local authorities of the discretion to determine the allocation of resources to the housing investment programme where and when they decide. Our amendment would give the local authority the discretionary power to tackle the worst housing first and to programme resources in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new idea. Strategies and programming to tackle bad housing conditions have not just been invented. Some of that work has been going on for the past 10 or 15 years. Local authorities have had to try to adapt that strategy and programme work in the face of declining housing investment allocations. I was somewhat surprised when the Minister tried to give the impression that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1040</span>
the housing investment programme was primarily for local authority housing because over the past 10 years, 25 per cent. of the local authority's housing investment programme bid has been for urban renewal work, for housing in the private sector and to set up housing action areas and general improvement areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and the amendment need to be considered in the context of what is happening to the housing investment programme and the unanswered question on this past of the Bill is: will the Government put in the financial resources behind the intentions that are stated in the Bill? If the Government want to make improvement grants available over a wider range of properties and conditions they must provide the necessary resources. All local authority housing investment money will be taken up by people applying for grants and those programmes will be exhausted unless the Government tackle the backlog of capital investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell now on means-testing as we shall come to it later in more detail. But it is important in this clause. The Government want to ensure—in their terms—that the right amount of help goes to the right people in the right property. That seems to be the hallmark of the introduction of the means test of income and resources. But there is a problem there. In addition to the means test of the individual income is the other starting point—the condition of the property in the locality. If we simply deal with individual properties we cannot tackle areas of housing deprivation. In some areas if people applied for a grant they could do so piecemeal. But the whole street could need improving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed it when the Government accepted the experiment of enveloping the whole street where there was a mixture of tenures. The roofing of the entire terrace, the renovation of the fronts, the renewal of doors, windows and so on, were all carried out together. That is common sense and an efficient use of resources, rather than pepperpotting an individual property so that one house in a terrace has an improved roof but has to be linked to the unimproved roofs on the adjoining properties creating difficulties at the join. In some cases it is better to do area improvements than individual grant works. If the Government are not prepared to give the local authority the discretion to set up that work it will be done on an individual property basis according to individual income. That will not tackle the condition of the housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to see that the Green Paper recognised that clearance was needed when it was published. But what was absent from that Green Paper was any reference to the back-up of a proper renewal strategy and the resources needed to tackle the problems. In the 1960s in Leeds there was much clearance work. The idea was to demolish the lot and rebuild. But the Labour party questioned that approach in Leeds at the time. We challenged it during the 1960s and 1970s and said that a renewal strategy would be better to save some of the older terraced houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

strategy goes wider than this amendment which deals with a narrow point. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing whether local authorities will have the power to set up renewal areas in future. If the clause is not amended, they will no longer be able to set up renewal areas. In Leeds 23 housing action areas deal with some 5,000 properties and 26 general improvement areas tackled 4,500 properties between 1970 and 1985. This clause will prevent the work that has been carried out since the 1970s from continuing because it will not be possible to programme the work at local level. The grant will have to be given to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may rule me out of order, Mr. Hunt, but the names of improvement areas and the geographical location of where the work is to be done could be as important as insisting that a grant goes to individuals who do not have the necessary financial resources. We need to tackle the backlog caused by the lack of capital investment in rented and owner-occupied private housing on geographical location. Obviously, I defer to your judgment, Mr. Hunt, but if you were to rule my contribution out of order because of my reference to renewal areas, I would be in some difficulty. It is in keeping with amendment No. 631 which suggests that local authorities have the power to set up housing action areas and general improvement areas. As it stands, the Bill rules that grant work must go to individuals. The council could not apologise to individuals, say that there is now a priority list with five improvement areas and housing action areas, and encourage people to take up grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have to be encouraged to take up grants. In the Nursery Mount area of Leeds, council officers had to persuade people that it would be in their best interests to have improvements done so that the whole street could be improved rather than just the property next door. They were advised that it would be better to have all the houses improved at the same time. Individuals do not rush to get grants evenly throughout the city or in areas of most need. Unless the local authority has the power to choose the most needy areas, clause 92 will be detrimental to housing strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper included a proviso which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"renovation is considered by the Authority to be the most appropriate housing solution".</p></blockquote>
That statement allowed that criteria, other than purely financial considerations of an individual, could be taken into account when developing housing and urban renewal strategies in cities such as Leeds. When the local authority put forward its housing investment programme bid for 1988–89, it received a letter from the Department of the Environment which read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This letter sets out the arrangements for making the HIP submissions for the financial year 1989–90."</p></blockquote>
The title of the section is "Housing strategy statements". It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have previously detailed guidance on the procedure for HIP submissions including the preparation of local housing strategy statements",</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1042</span>
and it referred to the Department of the Environment circular 38/78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DOE said that last year it emphasised the importance of those statements and drew attention to the need to reflect the development of authorities' enabling role and provide additional guidance on preparation. How, on the one hand can the DOE send a letter to the local authority telling it to develop the housing strategy statement and then provide in the Bill a clause that will prevent it from developing that housing strategy? Grants will simply go to individuals and the clause will limit the local authority from declaring areas of priority on a geographical basis according to need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, my local authority in Leeds bid for £97.6 million for this financial year. It asked for permission to borrow the money—it was not a grant—but it received permission to borrow only £15.3 million. I remind the Minister that of that original bid, £23.25 million was for that urban renewal work. It was for general improvement works and housing action work to be continued. Renovation work was to be continued into the private sector. Last year, Leeds spent £2.5 million on renovation grants for 806 properties. There are 56,000 private dwellings, requiring at least £5,000 each in repair work, so the backlog is huge. If everyone rushes forward for a grant on an individual financial-test basis, we cannot possibly have a strategy to tackle the backlog of the neglected capital investment that has continued in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I allowed the hon. Gentleman to go wide as I acknowledged that the Opposition had difficulty in tabling an amendment to the clause. I hope that he will accept that I shall probably have to rule that we have now had the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try not to stray as widely as the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). The amendment refers to specific proposals in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman referred to more general issues of area renewal, some of which were discussed last week and some of which will come up under new clause 11. I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman's anxiety on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 92 is a more generous provision than that which exists now. Under existing home improvement grant schemes, a repairs grant will usually apply only to a building that was built before 1919, and an improvement or intermediate grant refers only to a building that was built or converted before 1961. We believe that it is right to have a restriction on properties of less than 10 years of age, as most properties of that age will be covered by the National House-Building Council guarantee scheme. In any event, it is most unlikely that a property of that age will have deteriorated to such an extent that it would require works qualifying for grant aid. Should such exceptions emerge or should the NHBC scheme be extended, it will be possible to vary the 10-year restriction by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1043</span>
The restriction proposed is considerably more lenient than the current age restrictions and the hon. Member for Leeds, West is under some misunderstanding, considering the range of issues that he tried to cover under the specific amendment. I hope that he will not press amendment No. 631.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Hunt, that we have also had the clause stand part debate. However, I am in difficulty trying to show the impact that the clause will have if it remains unamended. Our amendment seeks only to delete the 10-year period, not to quibble about why that period was introduced. By and large, grants have been given on properties from about 1919. The local authority should have the power to make its own decisions in its own locality and to set its own priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a practical example which may sound strange to the Minister. I remember the case of a house that had been improved. Within 10 years, it was a house in multiple occupancy in a terrace that was to be enveloped. Some people had taken it over, decided to turn it into a co-op, tried to improve it and done it badly. When it came to enveloping the terrace, the property had to be improved once more. To improve the area, that property had to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course that property was an exception, and it is common sense to do the improvement, but under the Bill the local authority must come to the Secretary of State for a decision. That is ludicrous. I hope that that will not happen, and that the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment can say that such power is not needed and that local authorities should make decisions about their housing strategies. They already do that in conjunction with Department of the Environment officers when they make their HIP submission. Why can they not continue to do that, and let people get on with the job locally?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's real job is to ensure that, when submissions are worked out with the private sector and the Department of the Environment, HIP submissions are backed up with capital resources and the permission to borrow that is requested. They should not merely say, with good will, "We should like the housing to be improved and grants to be given to improve Britain's housing stock." At the present rate of progress, we shall be into the 22nd century before we tackle the backlog of repair, unless the Government put capital behind their good intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I made it clear that the 10-year restriction is wide and sensible. The purpose of the proposals is to clarify the present system of home improvement and repair. In this case, we are being more lenient than was previously the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On average, the Government are spending almost twice as much as the Labour party spent on private sector renewal when it was in power. We all agree on the importance of maintaining and improving the housing stock. Other parts of the Bill play an important part in relation to group projects for area renewal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment need not detain the Committee for long. It relates to the circumstances of a young couple who are about to buy a property that needs extensive repairs for which they need an improvement grant. They need a commitment from their local authority that it will give them the grant before they can obtain a building society mortgage. As drafted, the clause provides that the local authority may entertain their application for a grant but cannot approve it. Without the approval, the link in the financial chain may not be able to be secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why a local authority may not approve the grant. It does not have to pay money until the work is completed and a receipt obtained. Without approval, the purchase of the property may not go ahead. The amendment is designed to resolve that dilemma without, so far as I can see, compromising the position of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I understand the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, my understanding is that there has not been an outcry from people who are caught by the provision. Usually, local authorities can give an informal indication of whether a grant will be available. It would be extremely cumbersome, and unreasonable for a local authority to have to go to the expense of giving full consideration to an application and going through all the approval procedures, not to mention setting aside grant money, for a property

that the applicant may not buy. That could easily prejudice the success of another applicant who already owned or was a tenant of, a property for which a grant was sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a small technical problem with amendment No. 551 in that it would make grant approval mandatory for an applicant who proposed to acquire an interest in a property. I appreciate that that is not my hon. Friend's aim. I think that, in practice, an informal indication of the likelihood of grant approval will suffice to enable an applicant to obtain a mortgage if a grant is essential to obtaining the property. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured and withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to my hon. Friend's reply.

His party does not believe that legislation should apply uniformly to every part of the country. It offers opportunities for different policies in different parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the proposals are essentially precautionary. We do not have in mind areas where we intend to introduce the proposals, but they give some discretion or flexibility when it is appropriate to have different provisions for different areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 787 constrains directions given under clause 93(4), which is designed to cover situations where the applicant does not have the requisite interest in all the land on which the proposed works are to be carried out. We have in mind the renewal or installation of water supply pipes which extend beyond the curtilage of the property. For this purpose, directions are likely to be of general application rather than regional. There may, however, be some circumstances in which directions need to tackle a particular regional problem as, indeed, there may be circumstances in which different provisions are appropriate in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 795 makes a similar deletion to the power to specify different requirements for different areas in relation to works which are eligible for discretionary grant. Once again, we intend that directions will normally be of general application. Hon.

Friend will know that the policy presented by the Liberal party in one ward is often the opposite of that in the next ward. Unless the Secretary of State has the power to treat each ward separately, he might not be able to meet the requirements of the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the purpose of the proposal is to enable particular provisions to be made for particular areas, where necessary. For example, terraced properties in Nottingham might face difficulties because of problems with their retaining walls. If there were no known owner, the provision would enable specific assistance to be given for the walls to be repaired.

We intend that the grant system will, overall, be of general application and that regional variation, with the exception of the necessary variation between England and Wales, will be rare, if it occurs at all. We have to bear in mind the fact that the legislation must be adequate to cater for unforeseen local needs. I assure the hon.

My concern is not about any of the examples that the hon.

The power would be restrictive. It would be a case of saying, "This area has a problem with dampness, Instead of devoting enormous sums to tackling the problem, we will simply say that it is a natural part of the housing condition in the area, and for that reason it will not be eligible." I object to that restrictive power. It is easy enough for the Minister to show that it can be used to extend provision. That is not the question, and nor am I worried about it; indeed, I welcome it. My worry is that it enables Ministers to restrict the provision that may be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no intention of using the power, but it could be used as a precautionary measure—if a local authority embarked on a programme of concentrated aid for work that might more suitably be aided in another way. That is one possible use of the power where we felt that the local authority was not tackling the problem in the most appropriate manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that answer confirms my fear about the power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It clarifies it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps so, but it seems to me that the Minister has just confirmed that the power can be used not to allow local authorities to undertake work that would be undertaken in other parts of the world simply because the Minister does not want the local authority to undertake it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that, for the most part, the power enables regional assistance to be given in one form or another. The power would be relevant if it was believed that concentrated help in one area was being given in a way that we felt could more suitably be aided in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, one wonders what the Minister would consider more suitable ways. There is a host of possibilities, including not helping the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1048</span>
local authority at all. Will the Minister elaborate on the more suitable ways? I do not want to press the amendment to a Division, so I hope that she can respond in a way that will satisfy me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have put it as clearly and as strongly as is necessary. These are precautionary measures to allow flexibility. It is important to have the power in certain circumstances to protect the use of grant money, if necessary, but there are many ways in which assistance can be given, and they are spelt out in the Bill. We maintain that it is necessary to have the power, and I do not think that I can help the hon. Member for Truro further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), because I am not in any way convinced by the Minister. The Minister is really a wet in the Tory party, but has to masquerade as a dry. Consequently, she tries to give the impression that the Bill is introducing extra flexibility. It is not about flexibility at all; it is about giving the Secretary of State the power to decide what he wants to do in particular areas so that if he does not like the political complexion of a party and the policies that it is pursuing, he can change them. It is about central control and overriding the local electorate, which may have chosen a road different from that which the Government would like it to have chosen. The Government cannot abolish those local authorities, so they simply take powers such as these to allow them to intervene as and when they think fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro is right to be worried. The Minister should have stated the Government's intention clearly, and everyone would know where they stood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I agree with what the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has said. I should add that it is revealing to learn that Ministers believe that this is a form of regional power. The only sense in which it is a regional power is that it gives Ministers the power to be unfair to regions, which has never been supported by the Labour party or the SLD.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has shown that she does not want to reply, so I shall press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of amendment No. 633 is to allow a willing tenant the right to apply for grant aid. That is appropriate for private sector tenants who remain under a regulated tenancy who will not have a repairing obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 632 allows a local authority discretion, in special circumstances, to give grants to tenants who might otherwise be excluded by virtue of subsection (5). As we have seen on previous amendments, this matter concerns local authority discretion. We are discussing the continuing right for local authority tenants to obtain grants. I am trying to secure an assurance from the Minister that the tenancies that are to be specified will include council tenants. That is a crucial matter to which I hope the Minister will address her great intellect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
