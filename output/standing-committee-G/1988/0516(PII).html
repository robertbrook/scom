	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the advantages of the wise Chairmanship that we have experienced this afternoon is that suspending the Committee at suitable points enables members of the Committee to absorb fully the information and arguments put before them. It then becomes unnecessary to develop those points in the detail that would have been necessary had the sitting not been suspended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has not, alas, returned, but he posed two important questions. He asked me to speculate—one should never ask a lawyer to speculate—and he also asked me for a legal opinion. I am quite incapable of giving a legal opinion unless the instructions for it are wrapped up in pink tape. In the old days, the fee was always paid in advance. One of the things that has gone wrong in the post-war decades is that that is no longer the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not be surprised that during the suspension and during the course of the day I have been inundated with colleagues who have been approached by organisations representing village halls in their constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) has told me that the VAT bill for a village hall in his constituency could amount to £34,000. Every colleague in the Committee and outside could draw attention to similar cases. Indeed, the Father of the House has been on to me about this, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put my argument to my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary in this way: there is not a member of this Committee and there is not an hon. Member in the House of Commons who does not believe that the idea of charging VAT on renewals to village halls and on their heating bills is little short of outrageous. I am certain that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary would go as far as that if he could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in this position for one reason only—because of the decision and the scope of the European Court's judgment. Will my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary go back to Madame Scrivener, the lady in charge of the harmonisation of taxation in the Economic Community in Brussels? Will he ask her whether, if we were to find a mechanism for exempting village halls—I wish to confine my remarks to village halls, although other hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
Members may wish to concentrate on different areas—she would insist on taking us back to the European Court to enforce judgments against us for disobeying the judgment given a year ago? If my hon. Friend can assure me that he intends to keep the matter open to the very end before imposing VAT on this section of our national life, that will meet with universal applause both in the Committee and outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that village halls should not be subject to VAT. If my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary draws that to the attention of the Commissioner responsible for this matter and uses the evident feeling in the Committee to assist him to make further progress with her, he will be very popular with everyone. Instead of everyone developing arguments all of which drive the nail further into the coffin, that would be the correct way to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary can cheer us up as the evening progresses with encouraging news on how he will pursue our interests, because we are bewildered that the taxation of village halls is to be decided in Brussels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to further the present spirit of harmony and I hope that the Economic Secretary can find a way out of this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "village hall" conjures up the tranquil, idyllic scene that the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) portrayed before dinner, but it limits the impact of the VAT judgment. Those of us who represent urban areas, particularly deprived urban areas, know that "village hall" does not apply to some premises in our constituencies. In my constituency surplus school buildings, such as double classroom huts, have been turned over to community groups to provide extremely valuable community premises that the groups run themselves. We all agree that that is best done by the community, but the vision of the double classroom hut is not conjured up by the term "village hall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in some multi-storey buildings in Strathclyde, floors, roofs or premises in those buildings have been turned over for community purposes. I assume that, according to this ludicrous ruling, those buildings are considered to be businesses. Surely the Government could overcome that problem if the will is there. Political will is all that is lacking; the Government have the means to overturn the ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the crucial issue on community development is the availability of premises. Many hon. Members have in their constituencies premises that are simultaneously an enormous asset to their area, because they allow people to meet, but also a burden, because the price of keeping them going—be they village halls, rooms in multi-storey buildings, or scout huts—is enormous. It is difficult to contemplate the quality of community life if those simple premises are removed or rendered unusable because of the price that has to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must face up to their responsibilities and find a solution. If they do not, the responsibility and the burden will be transferred
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
to hard-pressed local authorities, because community organisations will turn to their local authorities and ask for an increase in grant or, for the first time, ask for a grant for village halls or other premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the briefing material on the issue it seems that the European Community made us honour our European obligations unwillingly. It seems that we were recalcitrantly dragged into line with Europe but then enthusiastically went further and started to tax what the EC never wanted us to tax. It is extraordinary, but no doubt the Economic Secretary will give us the simple explanation that eludes me at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider the cost of building new premises. Not as many community premises are built in my area as there were a couple of years ago under the community programme. Many organisations either extended premises or built new premises with the labour available to the community programme and small grants from the local authority to pay for the materials. Many groups seek to put up simple premises. The judgment will make that more unattainable and I hope that that problem will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a point that no one else has made. I may be under a misunderstanding and the Economic Secretary may have a simple answer, but if those premises are classified by Customs and Excise as business premises, does that not imply that when the poll tax is introduced, they will go on the valuation roll and rates will be chargeable? In Scotland, people have been shocked because they thought that caravans were to be removed from rating as they were residencies and domestic rates were being abolished. But if they were classified as second homes from which people derived an income, they were classified as businesses. Given this ruling, will village halls not only have to face the burden of VAT, but if the Government insist that they are business premises, have to pay business rates as well? If not, how will the Government square that circle? I am sure, never mind the EC, they do not want to be seen as the body imposing business rates on village halls through their poll tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the European Commissioner is saying that the Government are going beyond the judgment of the European Court and needlessly applying VAT to village halls, I assume that any citizen of this country could go back to the European Court for a judgment against the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary should deal with those serious issues. I hope that we shall not close the gate by voting on this matter today, so that the Economic Secretary, if he cannot accept the amendments, will have time to find a solution to the problem during our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Those amendments are grouped together under the lead amendment. If necessary, the hon. and learned Member will move them formally at the time of the Division. He does
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
not need to move them now; he needs only to speak to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, Mr. Cormack. I have an incorrect legend of the order in which the amendments are to be taken. That temporarily misled me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also suffering from the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members may have cause to regret their observations—my hon. Friend's absence is unavoidable because of a family bereavement. The comments illustrate that we are sometimes a little quick to pass judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that there is a large body of support for the sentiments that have been expressed during the debate. All members of the Committee have a considerable desire to see the Government take the opportunity, to reconsider the issue. There is some support for the view—I pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington)—that the Government are interpreting over-rigidly the terms of the judgment of the European Court of Justice. In that regard Madame Scrivener, in a letter of 21 March 1989 to Mr. Anthony Simpson, a Member of the European Parliament, wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At first sight the application of zero-rates to the building of village halls, if this is carried out for a non-profit making organization which is not registered for VAT, does not seem to me to have been condemned by the terms of the judgment."</p></blockquote>
If the intention is to try to enlist Madame Scrivener's support on the issue, it appears as if the door is partially open. To that extent, the Government's task may be less onerous than appears at first blush.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the importance of village halls and community centres in the lives of our constituents. The illustration given at the start of the debate is one that we all could have produced from our post and the representations that we have received. The issue does not apply just to village halls; it also applies to small charities. We should keep it in mind that the issue is not simply confined to what the debate has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several solutions have been suggested, such as donations. I have considerable reservations about that. If an activity is described as being a business, the fact that a donation is used as a means of providing funds might have no effect in determining whether a business is truly being carried out. Similarly, the suggestion that small charities or village halls should register for VAT creates the prospect of an intolerable burden being placed on enterprises that are substantially run by voluntary effort. I think that few of us would believe that that was an appropriate solution. Equally, it might be just as unhelpful to seek the assistance of local authorities. That would put additional pressure on them and the reclamation of VAT would depend on their co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Europe, as far as I understand it there is a different tradition in the running of village halls and community centres. Almost invariably they are administered by local authorities or their equivalent.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
If the legislation is to be a means by which the activity in all the countries of the Community is treated equally, it behoves us to consider the different forms of organisation for village halls and community centres. It would be a rather curious consequence if an activity in one country in the Community were subject to what many members of the Committee regard as a penalty, whereas the same activity in other countries, because of a different tradition, did not attract the same penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the Minister can have no doubt about the strength and unanimity of feeling on the matter. All members of the Committee will feel a deep and all-pervading sense of disappointment if, in his response to the debate, he does not allow some encouragement by at least suggesting a willingness to examine the terms of the judgment with skill and rigour, to ensure that what the Government seek to apply is truly implied in the terms of the judgment. If that be a barren or unsuccessful exercise, we would certainly wish him to take the matter back to Europe with the circumstances of the United Kingdom firmly in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Illsley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), I shall strictly confine my comments because most of the arguments have already been rehearsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only village halls will be affected by the Bill. Although my constituency is an urban industrial area, there are still community centres within it, which will fall foul of the VAT provisions. On that basis, I support the amendments. As my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie said, most of the community centres are schools that are now no longer in use. My constituency has a large number of schools that are becoming surplus to requirements because of falling rolls. Those schools have been taken up by community organisations and put to good use for charitable purposes. They will be affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major matter to which I wish to refer is about the miners' welfare halls throughout the length and breadth of the country. They were set up originally by the miners' welfare organisations in 1952, then handed over to the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation on the reorganisation of welfare provisions within the industry. A good many of those miners' welfare halls will be caught by the Bill, and there are facts about miners' welfare halls and institutions of which the Government may not be fully aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The halls are, obviously, located in mining areas or former mining areas. As such, they have been faced with a considerable run-down since 1985. Often, the miners' welfare hall will be the last remnant of the coal industry in a coal-mining community—which might be a small, isolated coal-mining village or a district that is part of a large conurbation. Well after the colliery's closure and after all industrial workings have ceased, the miners' welfare institute or the grounds, football pitches or whatever often continue
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
to exist. Because income is not available from mineworkers in the area, who contributed through their wages to the upkeep of the miners' welfare institute, the imposition of VAT on building works and other such items will have a great effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the welfare halls are located in the coalmining villages to which the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) referred. Although they have distinctly different social backgrounds, they are small, isolated communities which rely on the welfare halls that remain whether the colliery has closed or is still thriving. Much community life is still based around the miners' welfare hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation is funded jointly by British Coal, the National Union of Mineworkers and other unions involved in the mining industry. Miners' welfare institutes differ from ordinary village halls because they are quite wealthy—or would be, had the mining industry not been run down to a large extent. It would be interesting to know whether the Government have consulted organisations such as CISWO to try to judge the impact of the implementation of VAT on its programmes to refurbish, rebuild and replace miners' welfare institutes as they become dilapidated and run down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I echo the comments made by other Members? It appears from the briefing material supplied to us that the Government are taking the European Court's judgment too far. The European Commissioner's letter says that the Government have no need to impose such a strict interpretation of that judgment. Will the Economic Secretary reply to that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us have received a document from the Community Council of Devon. I was waiting for members of the Committee to raise some of the questions that it contains, particularly the section that alleges that
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no definition of business in the Customs and Excise Act 1983 and VAT legal advisers appear to rely on the decisions of two cases to determine that village halls are businesses."</p></blockquote>
The Community Council of Devon says that, in its opinion,
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is wrong to reach a decision on cases not related to voluntary non-profit making charitable halls which provide social welfare facilities for village organisations eg: cubs, scouts, brownies, guides, elderly etc etc. We believe those cases have not been properly interpreted by HM Customs & Excise.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Charity Commission insists that halls are Charities. Inland Revenue exempts them from tax and Rating Authorities from rates. Why does Customs & Excise insist they are businesses when it could easily and with more accuracy rule they are not?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister owes us an explanation, as we have been given an interpretation by some anonymous persons. It is not an easy interpretation to take back to the organisers of the functions mentioned in the letter. It is not enough to say that Parliament has ruled on the matter; we need to know precisely who has ruled and why they arrived at such an interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were a matter of my subjective preference, I should have no difficulty in accepting virtually all of the amendments and the sentiments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
that the Committee has expressed today. As my father was, and my mother remains, a member of the council that runs the local hall in the village where I was born, it would have been more than my life was worth not to go to every conceivable length to obtain the most favourable treatment possible under the ruling. I have wrestled long and hard with the problem, examined it from every angle and shaken it around with some of my advisers and officials to achieve a better settlement than at first seemed possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) for recognising the lengths to which we have gone to make the position for charities as favourable as possible. That sentiment has also lain behind our activities on behalf of village halls. He was also kind enough to promise me that if I cracked the problem I should be the "most popular Minister", subject to the amendment that my Parliamentary Private Secretary wishes to move, to the effect that I would be an "even more popular Minister". My hon. Friend movingly evoked the people of Wadenhoe and other villages in his consituency, where the problem raises fears of aborting plans for village halls or adding costs to the running of existing halls. I imagine that those fears have been expressed in almost every consituency and we are all sympathetic to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we know the conclusion that we wish to reach, why have we deemed it appropriate to introduce the ruling incorporated in schedule 3? After considerable scrutiny of the terms of the judgment by legal experts, it was concluded that it was not permissible to retain zero-rating for construction services supplied for charities' business purposes. The Court ruled that, whereas zero-rating for housing was acceptable, the zero rates for industrial and commercial buildings and community and civil engineering works were not, because the supplies concerned were not provided to final consumers. The judgment defines a final consumer as a person
	<br><blockquote><p>"who acquires goods or services for personal use, as opposed to an economic activity"</p></blockquote>
and finds that zero-rating for construction is permissible only when supplies are made to such a person or to someone so close to the final consumer that the supply may be regarded as being for the final consumer's benefit. We have concluded that that justifies the continued zero-rating of supplies for charities' non-business activities, as in this context they are final consumers, but not for their business activities. "Business' is a widely drawn concept in European Community and domestic VAT law, and includes virtually any supply of goods or services for money or its equivalent, irrespective of whether a profit is made or aimed at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help the Committee if I read out the underlying text from the "Richtlinie zur Harmonisierung". Article 4(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The economic activities referred to in paragraph 1"—</p></blockquote>
which were presumably referred to in the Court's ruling—
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall comprise all activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services including mining and agricultural activities and activities of the professions. The exploitation of tangible or intangible property for the purpose of obtaining income therefrom on a continuing basis shall also be considered an economic activity."</p></blockquote>
It has been ruled repeatedly that obtaining an income does not require one to make or retain a profit. In this case, we had to recognise that village halls that hired themselves out were obtaining an income and exploiting tangible property and so came within the EC definition of economic activity and business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the equivalents of village halls in the other 11 member states pay VAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems of the European Community—it should be a strength, but it has become a problem because of the way in which the Community operates—is that the member states have different institutions and different ways of organising themselves. I do not think that village halls are replicated in other member states. I do not know enough in detail about all of them, but I know of no parallel form of organisation. There are equivalent organisations which are state-funded. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has said that in most countries local government has financed and provided such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attempt to impose a uniform rule on diverse subjects creates the sort of anomalies with which we are dealing. That is why I expressed my regrets that this court case ever happened and said that I was not entirely happy with the judgment, although we accept that we must comply with it. Of course, in most other member states no zero rate applies to such activities, so they do not have to forgo anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Corby and the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, have mentioned the letter from the European Commissioner, Madame Christiane Scrivener, to a European Member of Parliament. Village hall representatives have read it as meaning that our interpretation of the judgment is too restrictive. The letter is ambiguous and I have written to Madame Scrivener asking for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that if the Commission confirms that wider zero rating for charities, or perhaps village halls specifically, is permissible under the judgment, the Government are prepared to put forward any amendments to the Finance Bill that are necessary. We have asked for an urgent reply. If our apparently clear interpretation of the law were not accepted by the Commission and it was prepared to go for a broader interpretation, we should like to know before the Committee stage of the Bill has finished, so that we can bring forward the necessary amendments at a later stage. I do not wish to hold out any false hopes. We shall just have to wait for the response from Madame Scrivener.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
the way we operate. The contribution of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) clearly showed the kind of difficulties that communities face. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our Euro MP, Lord O'Hagan maintains that it was not the intention of the European Court to impose VAT on charitable halls and other non-profit making community facilities."</p></blockquote>
The writer says that that has been reinforced in the letter from Christiane Scrivener, to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the spirit in which the Minister says that we should break through this impasse to reach out to the people and the communities involved. But I hope that we shall be resilient in our approach to the issue and will not give in easily to a diktat that goes to the heart of the way in which our communities carry out their business of maintaining an ongoing commitment to the people. We all recognise the nature of the day-to-day, week-to-week activities that the communities are engaged in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are looking at me, Mr. Cormack. Is it about my intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that was an intervention, I dread the hon. Gentleman's speeches. I shall allow him to complete it on this occasion, but that sort of topic should really be the subject of a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was too long. In any event, the Minister should put some steel into his campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fought the court case with every resource that we had. None the less, we are obliged to implement the decision, as it seems to be legally defensible and it protects us against further possible infraction proceedings. If the Commission makes it clear that it will not bring infraction proceedings against a certain interpretation that it accepts, that will ease the problem considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has some status in this matter. The opinions of a peer in Strasbourg on what may, or may not, have been in the minds of judges when they made the ruling have no bearing on the case; they have considerably less bearing than the guesses that any member of the Committee might make on the judges' intentions. It is the ruling that matters, and we must live by the judges' decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not possible to alter the obvious interpretation of the ruling—any widened interpretation would be vulnerable to infraction—we must seek administrative solutions that may not be for everyone but which, at least for some village halls, would minimise the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) suggested that possibility, particularly for village halls that are used largely by organisations which are members of the community association that runs them. It is then possible to get them to agree to make a donation instead of paying fees. In that way they avoid becoming technically a business operation. To the extent that it is possible and desirable, we are anxious to discuss that further with the Village Halls Forum and others concerned with the problem. That may help to mitigate the problem in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
The option to tax in some cases will be a possible way of minimising the overall tax burden on some village halls. They will be able to charge VAT on rents; a new hall will almost always find that it is better to do that because it can immediately reclaim all the VAT on the construction of the building, although it will have to charge VAT on its rents when the building is in use. However, it can reclaim the VAT on an ongoing basis on inputs to the hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are keen to consider any administrative way to mitigate the burden if we are stuck with the most likely interpretation of the ruling, which is incorporated in the schedule. We do not consider it right to recommend that the Committee should accept the amendments because they conflict with the obvious interpretation of the law. Only if we were assured that such a conflict would never arise could we proceed along the lines of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the issue of the poll tax and pointed out that the Government seem to accept a European Community ruling that a village hall is a business. Does that mean that a village hall would not be removed from the valuation roll but be classified as a commercial subject, eligible for commercial rates in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition in VAT law of what is, and what is not, a business applies only to the implementation of VAT. It has no bearing on the implementation of business rates. In any case, since last year, there has been a mandatory 80 per cent. relief for charities on the business rate that would otherwise be applicable; local authorities can go higher than 80 per cent. if they wish. Although I do not know the present position of village halls in the rating system—it does not fall within my competence—I see no reason why there should be any change in their treatment as a result of the ruling. Indeed, their rate burden, if any, should be small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other specific issues are related to individual amendments, which I cannot recommend the Committee to accept. The Government are anxious to do their best, as a result of our discussions with Madame Scrivener and, more likely, through administrative measures to try to minimise the burden on village halls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Economic Secretary comment on amendment No. 104, which seeks to delete the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"other than as an office"</p></blockquote>
from the provisions on the election to waive exemption in schedule 3? That relates to equality of treatment between charities constructing their own halls and charities leasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That amendment would impose a practically impossible task on the landlords of offices used by charities. Offices are, by their nature, likely to be used in part or at times for business as well as administrative functions. Unless he had a spy on every corridor, a landlord could not possibly keep track of when, whether, and to what extent an office
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
was used for business, and the problem would be compounded where the building was shared with normal commercial concerns. The task of making accurate and up-to-date apportionments so that the true position could be reflected in his VAT return would quickly become impossible. One must remember, too, that if the option is not allowed, the tenant will probably end up bearing in one form or another the landlord's non-recoverable input tax which will be increased next year when VAT is imposed on fuel and power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allowing the landlord's option to extend to charities' existing offices does, of course, involve some increase in their tax bill. That was why the Government devised the special phasing-in arrangements for charities. VAT will only be payable on 20 per cent. of the rent in the first year, rising by 20 per cent. steps to reach 100 per cent. of the rent from August 1993. That is a very substantial mitigation. In nearly all cases rent reviews will have been undertaken by 1993 under which charities' inability to recover the VAT can be taken into account in the rent level. For new buildings the rent level and whether the option is to be exercised can be negotiated at the outset. My firm advice to the Committee is that the Government have shielded charities from the worst effects of the European judgment and that the complications entailed in meeting the requirements of the amendment might well, in the longer term, prove a significant disincentive to accepting charities as tenants on reasonable terms especially in multi-tenanted buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's remarks, especially those about writing to the European Commission on whether anything could be done through exemption. All of us wish him well with that and hope that he can bring to bear on the European Commission in Brussels the peculiar circumstances in the United Kingdom regarding village halls and community centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that, we shall press amendment No. 91 to a Division to show the strength of our feeling. I am not persuaded by the Economic Secretary's argument on amendment No. 104, that it would go against the judgment in the European Court, and that if an office were regarded as having a relevant charitable purpose, we should get further infraction proceedings. I ask you, Mr. Cormack, to allow us to vote on amendment No. 104 in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 151, line 32, leave out sub-paragraph (8).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Item 1 of group 8 of schedule 5 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 is to be amended by including only dwellings where a person constructing a building grants a major interest to another person. In the case of a lease, that means for a period of more than 21 years. I am worried about tenants who are not in a position to take a lease in excess of 21 years at a premium. I should like tenants always to be able to do so, but that is not always possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8(b) on page 151 says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a premium is not payable, the grant falls within that item only to the extent that it is made for consideration in the form of the first payment of rent due under the tenancy or lease."</p></blockquote>
I am worried that it is the first payment. Will all subsequent payments of rent, therefore, be exempt? On casual reading, that does not seem to be the case. When the lease is for less than 21 years, input tax on items such as professional fees will not be recoverable on the construction of the building, even though it was built as and intended to be, a domestic dwelling or a number of dwellings. That cannot be right. If a developer is constructing buildings purely for domestic use, it comes under item 1 of group 8. If he subsequently leases and the lease is for less than 21 years, it seems that input tax will not be recoverable, I regard that as unfair. Is my interpretation right? If it is right, something should be done to tidy up this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) correctly interprets what his amendment would achieve. Short leases—those for less than 21 years—have never been zero rated. They have been exempt, so VAT on professional fees was non-deductible. The differences between short and long-term leases led to anomalies, which the basic change incorporated in the schedule seeks to put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our zero-rating for the construction of dwellings was strongly fought for in the European Court and defended by the Government on the basis of our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
social policy. But there is no defined social policy that would justify continuing to zero rate repair, maintenance and other services provided to a minority of long leaseholders, those living in buildings where the developer continues as the landlord, and therefore for rather odd reasons retain a zero rating. I emphasise that note (8) does not make service charges taxable where they were formerly zero rated. They are now exempt. Any tax incurred by the landlord cannot be recovered by him so he must pass it on in the form of a higher service charge or by becoming more efficient. I hope that that gives slightly better guidance about what we are trying to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another major source of contention. This part of the schedule imposes VAT on site pitch fees for caravans. Our amendments are not completely watertight and I will understand if the Economic Secretary says that our precise form of words cannot be accepted. Nevertheless, this is something that has caused much concern. Many people have holiday caravans in different parts of the country and they feel that they are being discriminated against by having VAT imposed on site pitch fees and services. People who own second homes have no VAT imposed on their ground rent or whatever. There seems to be a fundamental inequity of treatment, and it is up to the Government to do something about it. In our debate on village halls and community centres, I was pleased to hear that the Economic Secretary is taking the matter up with Brussels and that he will see whether he can obtain some changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 seeks to delete item No. 1(f)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provision of pitches for tents or of company facilities".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 4 deals with "Group 1—Land" and provides that the grant of any interest in or right over land will be exempt, other than the items listed from (a) to (k). One way of ensuring that the provision of pitches for tents or camping facilities is not subject to VAT is simply to delete subparagraph (f).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 101 concerns note (11) which defines a seasonal pitch. Clearly we do not need that definition if VAT is not to be charged on seasonal site pitches for caravans. Amendment No. 121 seeks
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
to bring this item into force a little later, not on 1 April but on 1 July. The Government propose that some items should come into force straightaway, but in other areas developers and other people have been given quite a long time to get their act together and to make certain provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Caravan owners are concerned that on 1 April the owners of many grounds throughout the country suddenly said that VAT should be charged. I am told that in some instances VAT has been put on ground rent as well as the seasonal pitch fee. This must be clarified. I am under no illusion that the Government will accept amendment No. 121, because 1 April has been and gone, but I hope that they will at least admit that they brought in the change too quickly. The European judgment must be put into effect with all reasonable speed, but the Opposition believe that the speed with which the Government put this measure through was unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be welcome if site pitch fees were not liable to VAT. I look forward to the Economic Secretary's reply and I hope that he will be as helpful to the Committee as he has been so far this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I explain the purpose of the schedule? I shall come clean with the Committee. I acknowledged on 6 February when the draft of the schedule was published that the proposal was not required by the Court ruling. We have chosen to implement it because it is appropriate and removes an anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea is to put seasonal caravan sites on all fours with other holiday accommodation. It does not affect caravans themselves or caravans which are permanently sited and available all year round for occupation. It will mean that if a caravan is on a site that by law and under its planning arrangements can only be occupied on a seasonal basis, it will become liable for VAT. Similar arrangements exist for properties that the hon. Member for Wrexham may think are typically occupied by different classes of person. Timesharing properties will be treated similarly, and hotels charge 15 per cent. VAT. So it is reasonable to put such sites on all fours with other holiday accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I was aware of the considerable resentment felt by some of my hon. Friends as well as by Opposition Members because VAT was being applied not only to pitch rental—people can understand that on the analogy with staying in hotels—but to rates and utility charges. We initially thought that it would be possible to retain the zero rate on, for example, electricity only if an electricity bill was provided by the electricity authority specifically for a particular caravan on a particular site, and that that applied also to rates, gas and water. We now think that it would be reasonable to make a concession which the Committee will welcome and which does not require legislative or administrative change. When a site owner can distinguish the utilities—electricity, gas and water—going to the caravans from those which are being used elsewhere on the site for swimming pools and so on, if he divides the amount by the number of caravans and designates it separately in his bills to those caravans,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
no VAT will be charged on the utility charges or on the rates for the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite how the uniform business rate will be treated is yet to become clear and I am discussing it with my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department of the Environment. However, it is clear that people with a caravan on a seasonal site will not be required to pay a community charge in the same way as people who have a holiday cottage. So some benefit is already built into our treatment under the new rating and community charge rules for those who have caravans on seasonal sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spelling out the more favourable treatment of caravans on seasonal pitches, I hope that I have dissipated some of the resentment about the imposition of VAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the Minister that it is not nearly enough. Is he aware of the feeling among caravan owners about the policy? It is not enough to talk about electricity. Do you realise, Minister, that for the thousands upon thousands of people who have a seasonal caravan it is the joy of their life and may be their only pleasure? Their holiday arrangements are entirely different from going to a three, four or five star hotel. I ask you to reconsider this, Minister, and take away the blight on caravan owners. They should be allowed the opportunity of living in and enjoying what they buy in their free time and their pleasure time. This imposition would rob thousands of people of the opportunity to enjoy freedom and relaxation in the way they do now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member enjoys an enviable reputation for good humour, but he must learn to distinguish between a speech and an intervention. I ask him to bear that in mind in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad that because of a failure to distinguish between the Chairman and the Front-Bench spokesman you took most of the blame, Mr. Cormack. However, I understand the feelings of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner). I have discovered that a remarkably high proportion of my friends and neighbours are possessors of seasonal caravan pitches. By and large, they will be pleased by the announcement that I have made. Most of them have not felt that it is unfair that there should be 15 per cent. VAT on the seasonal pitches that their caravans occupy once it has been explained to them that similar treatment will apply to timesharing arrangements and hotels. Not everyone stays in two, three, four or five star hotels as the hon. Gentleman does. VAT applies to zero-star hotels and it is not unreasonable to treat all forms of holiday accommodation in as even a manner as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister help me with the timing of the measure? If such timing was not required because of the judgment by the European Court, why was the measure introduced with such unseemly haste? Why was a period of due notice not given to allow people to make appropriate arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to come to that. Unprecedently for an increase in VAT, we published the provision on 6 February this year, ahead of the Budget. Normally extensions and changes in VAT are bound by the conventions of Budget secrecy until Budget day. This is an example of what might be termed green Budgetary. The measure was published ahead of the event even though that was not required by either the European Court or precedent, in order to give people the chance to prepare for it. I hope that the Committee will welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Illsley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak in support of the amendments. The measure, dealing with caravan owners, seasonal pitches and sites, will mainly affect old-age pensioners. Most of the representations that I have received have been from pensioners. They are people in the lower-income bracket who simply cannot afford an increase in VAT on that part of their leisure activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Government's point that the measure will bring caravan pitches into line with timeshares, hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation. However, caravans are different from hotels and flats. Caravans have been used as an inexpensive means of going on holiday. Until recently, when caravaning became an industry, it had always been considered as a lower-income bracket activity. The people affected by the measure are on low incomes and have tried to sell their caravans, but they cannot do so because of the imposition of VAT. They are now in severe financial difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
