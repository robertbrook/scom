	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 24, line 36, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and shall inform the person aggrieved in writing that he has made such a further report'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is relatively straightforward. It provides that anyone who is aggrieved by maladministration should be informed in writing if the local authority commissioner makes a second report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally, the ombudsman makes a recommendation and a follow-up or a second report is required, but the complainant does not have to be informed. It is good practice—we believe that it is his right—that he should be informed, given that he initiated the complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Question proposed, That the amendment be made—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. We were moving so quickly that I forgot the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are a magistrate, Mr. Hunt, as I am. I once made the mistake of not allowing the case for the defence to be heard before I dispatched a certain gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Member sentence the person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still sent him to the rack. It is wise to hear both sides of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) on his succinct speech. The amendment is sensible and reasonable but, because I am flattering him, the hon. Gentleman will realise that there is a catch. His suggestion was made about 15 years ago when previous legislation was being drafted. The proposal is already adequately covered. Section 30 of the Local Government Act 1974 states that the local commissioner should send the complainant a copy of his report of the investigations or his reasons for not conducting an investigation. Section 31(2) of the 1974 Act applies that requirement to further reports too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18, which amends section 31, will continue to impose that requirement by means of the substituted subsection (2c). I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 26, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) In section 26 of the Local Government Act 1974 (matters subject to investigation), the following subsection shall be inserted after subsection (1)—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where a complaint as specified in (1) above, is brought to the attention of a Local Commissioner, but other than in the manner set out in (1) above, or where no complaint has been received but a Local Commissioner has reason to believe that a member of the public may have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration in connection with action of the type specified in (1) above, the Local Commissioner may investigate that complaint or that action on his own motion.".'.</p></blockquote>
The Amendment would give the local ombudsman the right to initiate investigations arising from evidence that may come to him directly rather than through an individual referring a complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, a local ombudsman can investigate complaints only if a member of the public alleges that he or she has suffered injustice through maladministration. If a local ombudsman is aware of what appears to be injustice or maladministration, but receives no complaint, however, he cannot act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their 1980 and 1984 reviews of the ombudsman service, local ombudsmen requested the right to act on their own initiative. At the end of March 1985, under the heading "Investigation on initiative," the report of the Commission for Local Administration in England stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most Ombudsmen outside the United Kingdom can investigate on their own initiative a matter coming to their attention where injustice seems possibly to have been caused by faulty administration. Available figures show that about 5 per cent. of their cases are initiated by those Ombudsmen."</p></blockquote>
The report also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After a decade's experience it is clear that a number of cases brought to notice in the media seem more significant and serious than some complaints properly referred to the Ombudsmen by individuals."</p></blockquote>
In my view, ombudsmen should have the power to initiate investigations in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe report recommended that local ombudsmen should have a right of initiative. Under the heading "Power to initiate investigations" the report referred to the case argued by local ombudsmen which I have just outlined. The report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Research undertaken by JUSTICE in 1976–77 showed a very strong middle class bias among complainants, with over 70 per cent. of complaints being made by non-manual households."</p></blockquote>
Its conclusion from the evidence presented to it was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A power to take the initiative in an investigation could help towards redressing this imbalance. The ombudsman should not pursue a case except where there was good ground for concern, nor conduct an investigation into the general procedures of an authority rather than an individual case where there was reason to suppose that injustice has occurred. Subject to those provisos, we consider that a power to initiate investigations would be a useful addition to the ombudsman's powers.</p></blockquote>
Under the Heading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recommendations on the local ombudsmen"</p></blockquote>
the Widdicombe report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local ombudsmen should be given new powers to investigate individual cases on their own initiative."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
The Government rejected that recommendation. In my view, they were wrong. That power would be an important enhancement of the local ombudsman's role in tackling injustice. In some circumstances, it would clearly be an advantage. The Committee might not necessarily be inclined to believe me, but I hope that it will take seriously the views that were expressed by the local ombudsmen and Widdicombe. Indeed, the Minister has often said that the Widdicombe Committee was independent and that its advice should be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government rejected Widdicombe's recommendation, the ombudsmen welcomed it. In his final annual report, Mr. Cook—who was a local ombudsman from 1974 to 1985—stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I know of cases in the region which should have been investigated and the facts brought out into the open. Whether there was anything wrong or not, impartial investigation and report would have been in the public interest. But because I am no more than a response mechanism I have waited in vain for a referred complaint."</p></blockquote>
There is no question that those best able to judge the usefulness of such a power believe that it would be useful. Moreover, they know of circumstances when an investigation should have taken place but did not because no referral was forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clae observations on the Widdicombe committee report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is relevant that overseas ombudsmen who do have the power to investigate on initiative regularly record that they find it most useful to bridge a gap in the service they can otherwise provide to the community."</p></blockquote>
The power would bridge a clear gap in what local ombudsmen can do to respond to difficulties, and it would address the injustice that is suffered by the people who are least able to complain for themselves—those who do not know how to complain or who are afraid or unable to complain because of age, infirmity or physical or mental handicap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, 70 per cent. of complaints come from non-manual worker households, which suggests that those who are most able to complain are also those who are in the best position to use the ombudsman and the most likely to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Government believe that the amendment would change the role of the local ombudsman and make him more of a free-ranging investigator, but the scope of investigation would remain precisely as it is at present—that is, personal injustice caused by maladministration. Most foreign ombudsmen have that power, but it does not take over their role. Far from it—it accounts for an average of only 5 per cent. of cases. In other words, in 95 per cent. of cases they use the traditional route. Therefore, I do not believe that the initiative would fundamentally alter the type of work which ombudsmen undertake or how they go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the suggestion that the local ombudsman would lose the co-operation and goodwill of local government members and officers. I do not believe that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered the powers of the district auditor? They can be more draconian than those which the ombudsman can use against maladministration by a council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in the financial sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is more than that. The powers cover propaganda and the mismanagement of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. They concern financial mismanagement and the misuse of funds. The district auditor's role is not the same as the ombudsman's. If the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) believes that the district auditor's powers are more draconian, that is an argument in favour of what I suggest, because people will be allowed to have recourse to somebody with whom the council is more likely to co-operate. It appears to be an argument against one of the justifications which I suggested Ministers might raise in opposition to my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the experience of foreign ombudsmen suggests that there is a difficulty with breakdowns in the relationship between ombudsmen and those whom they investigate. The Government are prepared elsewhere to introduce whistleblowers into local councils, which I think would be intrusive. The local ombudsman's investigations are familiar and well understood, and while they have not always been accepted, the level of co-operation is generally high. I do not believe that what is proposed would fundamentally change what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of important of all, public confidence can be alienated if it is believed that matters are coming to light which are not being investigated. I believe that the goodwill of the public, which will come from seeing that local government is being properly watched over and that its work is being properly governed, can be weighed against any loss of goodwill from local government officers. Nevertheless, I do not believe that that loss of goodwill would be significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that, at present, many people do not refer cases to the ombudsman for all sorts of reasons. When National Opinion Polls was commissioned to do research for Widdicombe, it found that 29 per cent. of those who did not complain said that they thought that nothing would be done and that the ombudsman would not listen. A further 8 per cent. did not know where to go or how to go about it. People tended to believe that appealing to the ombudsman was not an especially effective route. Only 3 per cent. felt that it was the most effective route and only 8 per cent. would take what they thought was a wrong council decision to the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that in conformity with the hon. Gentleman's experience of his constituency? My experience is that—in all the varying classes that he mentioned—when a person feels strongly about something and has been unable to achieve results, his first response is to say that he will take his appeal to the ombudsman, whether or not the appeal is against a local council decision. Perhaps my constituency is different, but I find my experience difficult to square with what the hon. Gentleman said. Sometimes people react so quickly that they have to be told that they cannot take their complaint to the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will agree that not everyone takes that view. Some people go to great lengths to pursue complaints. They keep coming back to hon. Members' surgeries even when they have been told that they will not get any further, and they are likely to go on almost ad infinitum. Some will press ahead whether or not the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
Minister tells them that it is not a good idea to refer the complaint to the ombudsman. They will probably use their Amstrad word processor to refer their problem to almost every Member of Parliament. I am not sure that those are the people who we are talking about, although it is possible to go to the opposite extreme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent evidence of National Opinion Polls, which the Minister will no doubt agree is more reliable than anecdotal evidence, is that not only do such problems arise—the conclusions came from the ombudsmen as well as Widdicombe—but that most of those who wished to complain were Conservatives. Breaking down complaints by political preference, it was found that the lowest probability of complaint was among Conservatives. This suggests that many people have grievances which they do not refer to the ombudsman, for whatever reason. Perhaps they think that their efforts will not be effective, or that such a route is not available to them. More generally, I am concerned that at present, ombudsmen can discover evidence of what they consider is maladministration but cannot pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that, before he gave way to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick), he said that he would expound at some length on the reason that the Government gave for rejecting the Widdicombe proposal. I suspect that the debate will revolve around this point. The Government stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the ombudsman could lose goodwill and cooperation by acting, or appearing to act, as a general-purpose watchdog."</p></blockquote>
I realise that the hon. Gentleman does not accept that but for the benefit of the Committee—or perhaps for my benefit, as I am to reply—he should develop his reasons for not thinking that the proposal would operate that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to know how to reply politely. I thought that I had already explained my reasons. I made three points. First, nothing in the experience of foreign ombudsmen, who usually have the power that we advocate suggests a breakdown in trust and goodwill between local authorities and local ombudsmen. Secondly, the Government have introduced whistleblowers in local Government who might be thought to have more difficulty in this respect. Thirdly, public confidence that, if the ombudsman finds evidence of injustice, he will be able to pursue the matter and tackle it more than outweighs the slight loss of goodwill that might occur in local government, although I do not think that that is likely to happen to any significant extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a member of a city council until May 1988, and I referred many cases to the ombudsman when I deemed there had been maladministration by the council. An advertisement in the newspaper informs people when the ombudsman has been involved in a case. As a former Sheffield city councillor, I do not think that residents of Sheffield are so naive that they do not know who the ombudsman is. Almost their first words are, "I want to take my case to the ombudsman." The hon. Member for Truro is surely speaking of his own experience; perhaps his constituents are not aware of the opportunity. I wonder who is to blame for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not listening to what I have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand it, then. I replied to the Minister on precisely this point. People who do not complain in the first place are unlikely to come to the attention of a Minister, a Member of Parliament or a councillor. Moreover I am not using anecdotal evidence from my constituency but the research commissioned for the Widdicombe report. The figures are there for the hon. Gentleman to read. The evidence suggests clearly that, for a variety of reasons, most people are unlikely to refer complaints to the ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument goes further. Members of the general public are not always aware of maladministration that causes injustice. When the ombudsman investigates councils and is in contact with the press, he may bring to light matters that no individual could realise were the cause of injustice. People may feel that events are the natural result of the dead hand of bureaucracy in their local authority, in which case they will probably say, "That local authority always does stupid things." It does not occur to them that such injustices are the result of maladministration for which the authority could be brought to book by the local ombudsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ombudsmen are in a rather different position, and when they discover injustice, they should be able to initiate proceedings. The hon. Member for Hallam may not believe me, but I hope that he will consider carefuly the conclusions of Widdicombe and of the people directly involved—the ombudsmen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case advanced by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) deserves to be considered. I share his underlying concern, which is how to help people who do not easily find their way through a system that is designed to provide checks and balances. That is the core of his argument. Nevertheless, we shall not support the amendment. Our reasons are detailed and involve important questions of political philosophy and views on how politics should be carried out on the ground and who is responsible for ensuring that the public are properly represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot make a comparison with Northern Ireland. There is every reason for allowing individuals to approach the ombudsman without going through a third party in the deeply divided society of Northern Ireland where threats are sometimes made. I shall leave this subject, which the hon. Member for Truro did not mention—it has been raised before—because there is no sensible comparison to be made between Northern Ireland and Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wider issue is whether, if we have elected councillors to represent their community, we need another check to protect the general public and to scrutinise the way in which policies are carried out. First, we must decide what the purpose of councillors is. It is not, as some Conservatives would have us believe, simply to meet, make policy and go away. It is to decide council policy and to ensure, as far as possible, that it is carried out effectively and fairly. Ensuring efficiency and fairness is an important part of a councillor's job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know which Conservative councillor or former councillor is supposed to have said that councillors should merely make policy, but is this not a matter of checks and balances? Councillors sit as a board of directors and need to know when policy is not carried
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
out. It is the exceptions rule. They cannot know what is happening if they sit in an ivory tower and are not in touch with events, but equally it should not be necessary for them to go out collecting rents. That is where my thinking differs from that of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about a number of Conservative Members, not councillors—who think that councils can meet once a year, decide who gets which contracts and on general policies, and then leave everything to the officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit of an exaggeration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that I am exaggerating but that is what the Secretary of State said and it is written down. Suffice it to say that a number of Conservative Members believe that the role of councillors should be fairly simplistic—they should make policy decisions on rare occasions and not get too involved after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a legitimate argument about how far councillors should get involved. It is always difficult to know how far a councillor should inquire into a child care case, for example, and there are strict guidelines to protect individual rights and privacy, as is right. By and large, though, councillors of all parties try to ensure that the policies that they have decided are carried out efficiently and fairly, and in most areas councillors are sufficiently good and committed to hold advice surgeries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Truro that not everyone goes to those advice surgeries, but they are an effective way of putting over views about administration or policy—as is letter writing or telephoning Members of Parliament or councillors. People whose social skills are less well developed,—who are less able to write letters, use the telephone, or attend an advice surgery—are at a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro argues that the ombudsman should be given a free-ranging remit to inquire into alleged abuses of administration, but there are dangers in that. If a councillor feels that his political party, having lost the election, has not as much representation as he would like, he can ask the people who come to see him to go to the ombudsman about it—in other words, the role ceases to be that of the elected councillor, who is the proper person, and becomes that of the appointed representative of the ombudsman. We should remember that the reason for electing councils in the first instance—and, indeed, the reason for having Members of Parliament—is to ensure that there are elected representatives to whom people can take their problems. If those problems are not adequately dealt with, people can speak against, vote against or organise against the re-election of those elected persons. That is a central factor of democracy, both local and national, and the amendment suggests that the ombudsman should take over a significant part of that role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the ombudsman system. I supported it when it was first mooted many years ago. It was right to confine ombudsmen to dealing with maladministration—to have the system as a long stop against the odd balls that get through the net when local authorities do not behave as they should. We should not forget that, on the whole, local authorities respond well to people's complaints, and one of the saddest features of the past 10 years has been the way in which the Government have demoralised councils and
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
undermined the public's confidence in them. The feeling now is that councillors are a drain on the economy and that not too much time or effort should be spent on them. That is in contrast to what happens in other countries, where people recognise the importance of devolving power and giving local authorities more power, rather than restraining them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in danger of providing a check which could be misused in the political system and which could lead to the ombudsman going round local authorities examining alleged abuses put up by political opponents who could not win elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro may say—perhaps with some justice—that that does not happen in other countries, but I have to sound a note of warning on that. For a number of reasons, the British local authority structure is very different from that in Europe. I regret many of the differences because, as I said, in recent years the role of local authorities has been undermined, leaving them much weaker than their European, North American and Australian counterparts. The differences are nevertheless sufficient to make me think that the innovation proposed in the amendment would not be desirable and that it could easily be abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the risk that the hon. Gentleman envisages already exist. In an effort to cause trouble for the ruling majority group on the council, someone whose party has lost the political argument may make a point of referring each and every complaint made to him to the ombudsman, with a view to tying up council officers and generally making life difficult for the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is already true to some extent, but the amendment would open the gate considerably wider. A political party, would be able to draw matters to the ombudsman's attention by a variety of methods, which would include writing to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the second string to my argument. The main string is that I do not want the very important and central role of councillors to be undermined. That is the central issue. If we say that the ombudsman can respond on any issue of maladministration, it will not be an enormous step for people then to ask whether councillors are needed after they have made policy. As the ombudsman will be there to inquire into maladministration once councillors have drawn up a policy, there is really no need for the councillors to look into it as well. The amendment comes dangerously close to saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concern himself with how the ombudsman would pick up instances to investigate? Would they not be taken in an entirely accidental order, rather than in order of priority? It is difficult to imagine how the ombudsman would find instances if somebody did not alert him to them, and if somebody had alerted him, he would have every right to investigate. I do not see how the system would work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could let our imagination run riot and have the foreign ombudsmen mentioned by the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
argument, but the Minister has a point. I asked myself the same question, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Truro could give us examples. The ombudsman or a Member of his staff might be aware of a growing number of complaints about the administration of street cleaning and make representations on it but that is precisely the sort of thing with which councillors should deal. Councillors should take the brunt of such complaints because they will then be pressurised into initiating change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be all anecdote, rumour and counter rumour then, and surely that is alien to the Opposition. It would be like Big Brother if the ombudsmen came poking around because they deemed that a council or councillors were not doing their job properly. I welcome the sudden change in philosophy and the idea that there should be a body with powers similar to those of the police to enable it to investigate. I welcome the change, but I cannot see that it will be good for local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is clearly muddled, but I am not sure whether he is muddled to the point that he thinks that I support the amendment; I do not. Is he aware of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a relief. We can start from first principles then. One of the jobs of councillors is to respond to maladministration in their area and to take the pressure from the public. That is the principle that I am trying to protect and, indeed, to enhance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, councillors do not always do their job very well—if hon. Members are fair, they will say that it can happen in all political parties—and one can get very angry with them, perhaps because they do not respond to letters or take up individual cases. Those are the councillors who often end up with a visit from the ombudsman, a letter from a Member of Parliament or something of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do when there is a problem, as I suspect my hon. Friends do and I imagine other hon. Members do, is first ask whether the person concerned has seen his councillor. If he has, I then ask why the councillor has done nothing about it, because one wants the councillor to take the pressure. I am fortunate in my area in having councillors who now run regular advice surgeries and take up cases. I believe that it is fairly common—certainly not as uncommon as some would have us believe—and we should encourage it. We should not say, "You don't need to go to your councillor on a general issue of maladminstration; you can go to the ombudsman." We should say, "You ought to go to the individual elected person." What is proposed is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Truro has raised an important issue in tabling his amendment. I considered tabling a similar amendment at one stage, but I ruled it out for the reasons which I have explained. The hon. Gentleman has also drawn attention to the fact that the ombudsman system is overdue for reform. I touched on that during our previous sitting. The system is not working as well as it might, and I can understand the frustration felt in the ombudsmen's offices around the country. It is being said that the way in which the system functions should be examined, and I agree with that. The funding of the system should also be examined; indeed it is the subject of a future amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
The hon. Member for Truro has raised some important points, but if we are to preserve the responsibilty and accountability of the local councillor as central to our system of democratic local government, we should keep it there and not pass the general duty to the unelected ombudsman. That is why the Opposition oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has said, particularly in the past two or three minutes, suggests—no doubt not intentionally—that locally elected councillors are infallible. We all know that Members of Parliament are not infallible and that councillors are not infallible either. We know also that injustice sometimes occurs in circumstances in which it does not manifest itself either to Members of Parliament or to local councillors. That is why, no doubt, Parliament conceived of the notion of an ombudsman for parliamentary and local government matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the hon. Member for Hammersmith believes is true, there would never be any need for an ombudsman on either parliamentary or local government matters, because aggrieved people could always rely on the expertise of their elected representatives. Once the principle of having an ombudsman is accepted, it should be properly applied, and no injustice should be allowed to pass without being investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a Local Commissioner has reason to believe that a member of the public may have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration".</p></blockquote>
That echoes the spirit of the Widdicombe report on page 222, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ombudsman should not pursue a case except where there was good ground for concern, nor conduct an investigation into the general procedures of an authority rather than an individual case where there was reason to suppose that injustice has occured. Subject to those provisos, we consider that a power to initiate investigations would be a useful addition to the ombudsman's powers."</p></blockquote>
I shall not rehearse the arguments so eloquently marshalled by my hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). The suggestion that the auditor is a suitable alternative to the proposal ignores the fact that an auditor will be concerned with whether a council has acted ultra vires so as to incur expenditure which it is not legally and legitimately entitled to incur. Many cases of injustice caused by the maladministration of local authorities do not raise the issue of the financial vires of the councillor have any financial implications or consequences. The auditor is available to any member of the public who feels sufficiently aggrieved to interest him in any issue which money has been spent illegitimately, but that does not cover many cases in which there has been maladministration and therefore injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in the allocation of a local authority house, there are no financial implications of which the auditor would be entitled to take account, but a person who had not been properly treated in the allocation of a house may have suffered a manifest and severe injustice. The auditor would have no powers to intervene in such circumstances. For that reason, the amendment should commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) did a good job—apart from the political cant—in shredding the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), which the hon. and learned Friend the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman against direct access? I understood his argument about undermining the role of the local council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, in the sense of someone being able to write directly to the ombudsman. That is possible already and it is vital that it continues. I meant direct action on general public issues by the ombudsman, for example, responding to people who say, "This is not being done very well in this area. Why don't you look over there?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has made it clear. I misunderstood what he said. A member of the Opposition in another place proposed an amendment seeking direct access, which we accepted. I am glad that we agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister raised the most important matter: how will a local government officer identify those cases that he believes are worthy of investigation? The hon. Member for Hammersmith said that he had asked himself the same question. The officer might consider discovering those cases worthy of investigation through the local press, but how many members of the Committee are satisfied that reports in their local paper are accurate? More importantly, would an individual whose case is reported in the local newspaper want that case investigated? Our debates have not dealt adequately with that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro said, correctly, that the Government have introduced a number of whistleblowers. But I do not accept his argument that local government officers will not feel aggrieved if a local government ombudsman has such wide powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
	<br><blockquote><p>The White paper stated: "We believe the ombudsman could lose the goodwill and co-operation by acting, or appearing to act, as a general purpose watchdog."</p></blockquote>
I believe that strongly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) said, it is a matter of checks and balances. The local ombudsman could improve the quality of administration in local government not by carrying out ad hoc investigations but by passing to local authorities the wealth of experience that he or she gains through the investigation of individual cases of maladministration, and by identifying common themes and mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall table amendments which will give the local commissioners specific powers to publish general guidance to local authorities. I accept that there would be no requirement that local authorities should follow such guidance, but it would encourage good practice and therefore be worth while.

I wish to raise a couple of cases involving Bristol City Council and the ombudsman which have only recently come to my attention, will the Minister consider before Report whether, in the light of my remarks and of the debates of our previous two sittings, the clause needs strengthening?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the only Member from the south-west on the Conservative Benches. Bristol is relatively near my constituency, although I believe that both cases were handled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave), who is now the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only half an hour ago I received a bundle of letters. Some have already gone to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and correspondence on one case has gone to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I shall not go into the merits of each case. I shall only spell them out as I suspect that the Minister's officials are aware of the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first case involves a three-year dispute between Bristol city council and the Bristol exhibition organiser, Mr. Ray Purnell. Mr. Purnell's letter to me, sent last night, claims that his case is
	<br><blockquote><p>"said to be the biggest and most complicated yet tackled by the Ombudsman."</p></blockquote>
I understand that the case has been the subject of hours of television and radio time and that it has attracted interest from four newspapers. Indeed, the Bristol 	<i>Evening Post</i> first drew it to my attention. Moreover, I believe that a fictional television series based on the episode is being prepared by Central Television. In support of the long-running complaint to Bristol city council, which has been the subject of one, possibly two, reports by the ombudsman—the second not yet published—criticising the council for failing to take actions on the finding of the first report, Mr. Purnell told me on the telephone a few moments ago that Bristol city council makes Liverpool council look like choirboys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I do not want to be a party pooper, but can you explain the relevance of this case to a clause stand part debate? I do not understand why it is being allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly the same thoughts crossed my mind. I hope that the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) will return to the clause. He seemed to be talking generally about a local ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I do not intend to go into detail on either case. However, they show that powers to strengthen the ombudsman's role and enforce action following his reports need to be vested. This issue has been the subject of debates and, as it was not related to an amendment, I thought that I would raise the issue on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is slightly curious that the hon. Gentleman—I draw this to the attention of his local newspaper, which no doubt he now has in mind—voted against an amendment that would have given his constituents power to go to the county court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people in question are not my constituents. The matters have come to my attention only recently. I raise them to give my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene. However, I recognise a press statement in Committee when I hear one. Most of us have been around long enough to know what this is about. I would have more time for the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) if he had voted in a way that would give constituents the power to go to a county court, but he voted against the proposition and denied people that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more offensive is that the hon. Member for Taunton is using the issue to attack Bristol city council in a way that I suspect is purely politically motivated, although I do not know the facts. What does the hon. Gentleman know about Bristol city council? He represents another area of the south-west. When I drew attention in the House of Commons the other week to some of the housing problems in the area that he represents, I was not sure that he was fully aware of the nature and extent of them, so what can he know about Bristol, for heaven's sake? He would carry much more conviction if he had supported the amendments that he says should have been carried, instead of voting against them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has just about recognised, I was not dealing with my own constituent's case, nor reading from a press release. I was referring to press cuttings.

The other case to which I referred, which was also dealt with by my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in his capacity as hon. Member for Bristol, West, related to a Mrs. Jill Moore, who had spent £90,000 renovating her house in St. Paul's, Bristol. The council told her that it would give her improvement grants.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. I am puzzled by section 31A(4) in clause 20(1), which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an authority considering a further report of the Local Commissioner under section 31(2A)".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (4) refers to "a person or body". Does that include the Committee that originally considered the complaint? It is difficult to know what is meant. It is a technical matter on which the Minister might wish to take advice. While he does so, I shall mention another matter which needs clarifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
who or what is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person or body with no interest"?</p></blockquote>
What criteria will local authorities apply in deciding that? subsection (4) has some strange phrasing. It refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"consideration of the Local Commissioner's report without also having taken into consideration a report by a person or body with no interest in the Local Commissioner's report."</p></blockquote>
obviously, that links with the initial reference to a "person or body", but I do not know whether it refers to the committee that originally considered the complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of section 31 A(4) is strange. If the matter is considered by the full council, the Committee that originally considered the case will want to express its views. But who will provide the disinterested point of view? If there were two "interest" reports—if, say, the complainant were allowed to submit a further letter to support the claim—would there have to be two disinterested reports?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
The provision is unclear and if the Minister can shed light on it, that would help the Committee to determine its atitude to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matters raised by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) are perfectly reasonable. First, "body" includes the committee; that is certainly so. The hon. Gentleman's second point related to a person or body "with no interest". When there is consideration of such a report from the Committee, it is intended that there should also be an independent report from, for example, the monitoring officer, or an officer who was not involved in the original decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were worried about several cases when the ombudsman's report—sometimes his second report—had elicited no proper response from the local authority. Some people therefore suggested that it should be compulsory for the authority to do whatever the report said. My view—which, I believe is a common view in this Committee—is that such an approach would give rise to real problems. Often, local authorities—with gratitude but, perhaps not with pleasure—co-operate with the ombudsmen to solve problems. If they knew that the end result of such a procedure might be compulsory, that early co-operation, which is so valuable in many instances, might be imperilled. On balance, we had to be careful about taking such an approach, although pressure was exerted upon us in various ways and, indeed, was supported publicly by the ombudsman himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggested an alternative approach and I am happy that the ombudsman feels that it is the preferable course; we hope that it will have the desired effect. It is an attempt to use public discussion to protect the citizen without compulsory enforcement of an ombudsman's report. That is the purpose. It therefore seems sensible to have a fresh eye on the issue, when it comes before the full council, and not merely a discussion of what the committee has already said about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. As hon. Members know, I had discussions with Coventry City Council about a report. I said that one of the difficulties that faced the Government as a result of its actions—actions which, interestingly enough, were not quite the same as those of which the Committee was told—was the growing support for the imposition of an ombudsman's report. This is an attempt to strengthen the report without taking it to the legislative end that has been pressed on us, whereby if a report were made in future, Coventry would be forced to take the steps that it has not taken on the recent occasion, that being one reason for the considerable public dissatisfaction. In a letter to me in January, Coventry City Council stated that the matter had been dealt with only by a committee, and that the same committee that made the decision had discussed the report. The report was debated at a council meeting, only after there had been considerable public pressure and an Opposition motion condemning the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested at our previous sitting, first, that the Council had the support of its Conservative opposition. That is entirely untrue. The Conservative opposition voted against it and tabled a motion in which they criticised the Council for the decision that it made, and hon. Members who suggested otherwise were misinforming the Committee—I am sure unintentionally. Secondly, it was not a decision of the Council in general; it was a decision of a committee. That committee rejected the report. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
matter reached the Council only because of the row that ensued about it in the local press, because I intervened, and because the local Conservative opposition tabled a motion condemning its action. That is how the matter came to be considered at the Council's general meeting, but at that meeting there was no report from an independent officer who had not been involved. That example shows exactly why we have had to introduce clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman has said that there is no question of fiduciary impropriety. He has ruled that Coventry City Council'a fiduciary duty does not get in the way of paying the £17,300 that it has taken from one of its local people. That is what Coventry Council has done. Twice, the ombudsman has said that it has done it, but the Council refuses to pay. In such an appalling and disgraceful case, it is difficult for me to resist the idea of compulsory implementation of such a report, but I draw back from that because I do not believe that hard cases should change the law. Instead, I have tried to find the best solution that is possible without the introduction of compulsion. That is why an independent report would be presented to the Council, and Councillors, the local press and everyone else would see how the report relates to their council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, however, that does not always result in justice being done, and in the example that I gave it is clear that justice has not been done. But to secure justice in that case, we might avoid justice in many other cases, because the ombudsman would secure much less help at an earlier stage, and would therefore not achieve the many satisfactory solutions that are reached by agreement between sensible councils and the ombudsman. I am only sorry that Coventry is an example of a council that should be ashamed of itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has broadened the argument. The Minister has explained what is meant, and I now understand that the Committee is one of the appropriate bodies referred to, but what he has said confirms what Opposition Members said the other day about the cumbersome and convoluted nature of the system. Surely it would have been easier to accept our amendment, which would give an individual the right to go to court. The court could adjudicate in a reasonable and normal way without this incredible system, which may not work and which is extremely bureaucratic. The Minister has missed an opportunity to simplify the Bill without undermining the authority of local authority councillors. Most local councillors readily accept that if a person has a legal challenge against a council, he can pursue it in the normal way. The amendment would give a small number of individuals the opportunity to go to court. Coventry is a good example, where the Minister could have resolved the issue by accepting out amendment, but he chose not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. Coventry is not such an example. The ombudsman did not say that Coventry City Council had a legal responsibility to pay the money; he said that the council had a moral responsibility, and that it had acted immorally. It is not something that could be justiciable in law. The ombudsman is able to make a report, irrespective of whether the law says that a sum of money is recoverable through the law, and decent, honourable people would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
accept that it was their responsibility to pay that amount. Coventry City Council has acted dishonourably and indecently, but the issue is not one that could be brought to a court. Unfortunately the ombudsman has relied on the honour of a council which appears to have no honour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot allow the Minister to get away with that. I shall not repeat the words that I quoted of the Conservative councillor in Coventry. Suffice to say that there was considerable support for the way in which the inquiry was carried out. The quotations can be found in the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our previous sitting. The Minister is reported—I do not know whether he was reported correctly, and I am perfectly happy to give him the opportunity to put the record right—as saying that the council ignored the ombudsman's recommendation, and that the Conservative councillors, along with other councillors, strongly objected to that view. There may be argument about whether the council did the right thing, but the councillors do not accept that the ombudsman was ignored in the way that the Minister suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without going into the Coventry case in great depth—there are clearly arguments on both sides—let us consider, first, whether the council took the issue seriously. When the complaint was received, the committee that considered it was an all-party body. It consisted of the lord mayor, the deputy mayor, 10 Labour members and two Conservative members. That reflects a council in which the balance is 42 Labour, 11 Conservative and 1 Social Democratic. No one can say that it is an unimportant committee, or that it would not give the issue careful consideration. The issue was fully debated by the committee on both occasions—the debates lasted 10 to 15 minutes—and the matter was considered on an open part of the agenda. In other words, the public were able to attend the debates. The initial decision by the committee to turn down the change of views on the shop where the argument initiated was taken on the recommendation of officers—that is similar to the way in which planning matters are treated—and the final decision was at member level, as the Minister is aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman's statistics at the back of the Coventry chief executive's brief show that during the past five years few complaints have resulted in formal investigation. The important consideration is that Conventry succeeded in its clear legal duty to get the best deal for the council and for its ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should Coventry say that the ombudsman's recommendation overrules the council's fiduciary duty to get the best deal for its ratepayers? We can imagine what the Government would say if a council declared, "We're not worried about our fiduciary duty. We'll simply allow the ombudsman to overrule it." A few moments ago the Minister said that the ombudsman said that fiduciary duty was not the overriding factor, yet the decision is not within the ombudsman's remit within his legal or accounting expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither you, Mr. Hunt, nor I know what would have happened if the council had paid the money and the Audit Commission had been called in to examine the payment. The ombudsman or the Minister do not know either. It is disingenuous of the Minister to say, "The ombudsman said it could do it, so it's all right."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
Surely the Minister is not suggesting that the ombudsman can overrule the Audit Commissioner. I do not believe that that is his argument, yet that is what he is telling Coventry to assume. A few moments ago he said, in effect, that the ombudsman is an appropriate person to say whether, in the light of its fiduciary duty, a council was right to pay a certain sum of money for a particular purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not even the Minister is so out of touch with local government that he does not know that if the council had made the payment and the Audit Commission had stepped in and said that it should not have done so, the commission's ruling would have involved a much more serious issue. We all know that the commission's decision would have overruled that of the ombudsman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The law says clearly that if the ombudsman concludes that there has been maladministration and that the council should pay the complainant compensation—in this case £17,300—it can do so without reference to fiduciary duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant section of the Local Government Act 1974 provides specifically for local authorities to make compensation to persons whom the local ombudsman has found to have suffered injustice as a result of maladministration. The provision gives councils the power to do so. That is what Coventry should have done and that is what the Conservatives on Coventry council voted to do. The Labour party refused and an ordinary, decent, small shopkeeper was left £17,300 down the drain. It is no good trying to defend that council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) replies, may I say that the debate is developing into a discussion on the conduct of Coventry City Council. A passing reference is in order, but I hope that we can discuss the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Hunt. You are quite right. I have been trying to discuss the clause. However, I had to respond to some of the Minister's remarks to put him right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister refers to the provisions of the Local Government Act 1974 that deal with the commissioner. He knows that the provision does not overrule the powers of the Audit Commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must listen. I see that he is being passed information and I shall give way to him again in a moment, but the explanation in his intervention is not sufficient. If the local authority had accepted the ombudsman's ruling, it would be obliged to do so in similar situations where there might be a question of what compensation should be paid on the basis of a property's market value at a particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot pretend that the original Act overrules the Audit Commissioner's duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that the hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The section of the 1974 Act to which I referred, which was supported by many Members on both sides of the House, was intended to cover the situation that we are discussing although he says that it does not. The hon. Gentleman dissents. I refer him to the notes on clauses which refer to the 1974 Act and spell out that what he said is untrue. The Bill enables a council—we have spoken of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
Coventry, but let us imagine another—to do what the ombudsman asks of it without falling foul of a later auditor's report. That is the reason for the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong, and I will tell him why. He is right to say that, if he means only that it will safegaurd the council from surcharge, because that is what protects it from carrying out an illegal action. The problem for any council in such a situation is that, if it has to pay money which, as a result of the ombudsman's interpretation of one case, leads to its going before the auditor, it will not be protected. It is true that it will be protected against a surcharge, but that is all. The Minister was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that a council could not so act, but not because of the auditor's action on this occasion. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) to sigh. We are talking of individual people who are suffering, and the House is about dealing with individuals who suffer, as is the ombudsman. If the hon. Member for Brightside is bored, he can go where he has been for most of the time, which is outside the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) suggest that Coventry or another council could not act in this way because, at some future date, if faced with the same situation, it would have to act as the ombudsman suggested but would not be able to do so because it would contravene its fiduciary duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit thick for the Minister to claim to be concerned about the individual rights when the Government have doubled homelessness and unemployment, and undermined democracy more than any other Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows the background to the case. Without going into detail, which you, Mr. Hunt, would rightly rule out of order, I remind the Committee that we are talking about which valuation ought to be accepted and at what time. That has policy implications. If a local authority followed the ombudsman's line it would have to do so in all cases or risk being in the same situation with each case thereafter. That is not usual practice which is why I am telling the Minister that although the part of the 1974 Act that he quoted protects the council from surcharge, which we do not dispute, it is untrue to say that it would therefore protect a local authority in other cases of this type in which it had to take account not of what the ombudsman says but what the auditor says. If the Minister wishes to confirm that, let him do so. His case would have been much more impressive if he had intervened when Westminster City council ignored a local authority ombudsman's case and ordered repayment of only part of rent arrears which had arisen due to its maladministration. The Minister does not mention that because he is not interested in it—he is interested only in the case being debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can have the Minister's attention for a few moments before he seeks more advice in desperation. The way to solve these difficulties is to accept the amendment that we tabled earlier. I will happily bring it back to him on the Floor of the House if he agrees. It would allow a person to go to court. That would allow the Minister to claim that he is protecting rights—including those in the Westminster case—which I wish to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
What is more important is the fact that the present situation is different. The issue is not just about compensation, it is about whether the council could have allowed the shop to assign and get the best deal for ratepayers. That is why it is so much more complex and why Conservatives on the council were much more willing to support the officers than the Minister implied. I do not suggest that Conservatives said, "We support the Labour party against our own Minister.", but they supported the way in which the officers had acted. I think that the Minister's councillors were nearer the point than he was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go over the details, but I will answer the hon. Gentleman directly. Many criticisms can be made of any Minister I am happy to be criticised and I shall be robust in defence. One thing that no one can say, however, is that I am being other than even-handed. If a second report is produced in this instance in precisely the same situation as that of Westminster, and I consider that Coventry decided to act in an improper manner in the defence of an individual, I shall be happy to say so publicly. I did the same in regard to councillors' interests. I do not believe that anyone can accuse me of not being even-handed in any instance. I shall be happy to do the same with Coventry: I will wait until a second report is presented and responded to. After that, a Minister can reasonably be expected to comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's assurance that he wishes to be even-handed and to consider the Westminister example. I will give him details of that, and ask him to respond in the way that he promised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need the hon. Gentleman's details because, obviously we keep such matters under close scrutiny. That is why the situation has not reached the same point as at Coventry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned previous amendment. He suggested that the Bill would be better without clause 20 and that the previous amendment should replace it. You were right, Mr. Hunt, to allow the conversation to continue. However, the replacement amendment missed the point. One reason many of us supported the introduction of ombudsmen—I am not sure what the plural of ombudsman is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ombudspersons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ombudspersons. We realised that, in many instances, maladministration is not justiciable in the sense of having a court case which is fought and won, but about asking what a reasonable person would think a public authority ought to do. That is a most important matter, and the ombudsman, with greater informality and the ability to judge the term "reasonable people", was introduced as an important defence of individuals against bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In situations that are sharpest and most difficult, where on a second report the ombudsman has told a council, "You really are wrong about this matter and this person has suffered." We are wrong to say that all is well and that the person can go to court. That is precisely where he cannot go because the court is not able to make a judgment in such circumstances. It was to protect such people, who cannot gain the protection of a court, that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
ombudsman's role was created. So, far from helping, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hammersmith would merely provide that a person who could have won his case in court if he had not gone to the ombudsman, may go to court after the ombudsman has reported, and may get extra support for his case because of the ombudsman's findings. I am concerned about the person who could not have gone to court and won his case because, although what he did was not exactly illegal—otherwise he would have had to succumb—the circumstances show that he acted dishonourably and ought to have acted honourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My problem in being other than sharp with Coventry is that the case is not as the hon. Gentleman made out. It is not a matter of what should happen to a lease. Coventry argued that all along and was told each time by the ombudsman that it was wrong. A person was told that he could not transfer the lease to a company himself, but when the council took back the lease, it transferred it to that company and made a turn on it. Although that benefited ratepayers, it was to the disbenefit of the man who held the lease and who, in other circumstances, would have been allowed to transfer it. If the hon. Member for Hammersmith is arguing that that case will have a knock-on effect in other circumstances, that is the problem with his case, because in other circumstances people have been allowed to transfer their lease. The issue here is that that particular individual was done down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in future, the publicity which will inevitably arise here will discourage councils such as Coventry from acting in that way, and prevent our having to go down the dangerous route of making all the decisions of the ombudsman legally enforceable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) and I were trying to make is that we should not focus on what may or may not be an unacceptable situation in one authority. There will certainly be similar examples in councils of all political persuasions, but we should determine legislation which takes account of different circumstances and achieves what the Minister has repeatedly said he wishes to do, and which I hope he accepts is the intention of us all—to protect the rights of the individual in the face of local and central government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem in Coventry council concerned dealing with commercial activities. Officers with fiduciary duties tend to act in the same way as their counterparts in private business. Sub-leasing has always been done very much in the way that Coventry council has done it, and it can lead to individual and corporate holdings finding themselves at a disadvantage. They may want to sub-lease, but are prevented from doing so and then see the sub-lease reallocated when the parent company takes it back. Local authorities are expected to act commercially on all occasions except in a situation of that sort, and it is a genuine problem for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a very long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hunt. I should prefer the Minister to agree that it is right that commercial considerations should never override the decent behaviour of any local authority or government when dealing with individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely true. Of course decent behaviour must be the prime ruler in such decisions, but here there was disagreement about what decent behaviour was. The ombudsman said that decent behaviour would involve paying the man the £17,300 which had been taken from him. Why did Coventry council not do that? It is protected by law from being surcharged, so it could have had no doubts on that front. Why did it behave in that way? The reason appears to be that it was determined to ignore what the ombudsman said and to insist that it knew best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, but I do not like councils of any political party that think they know best when an independent adjudicator has put the case so clearly. I have made that clear to the hon. Member for Hammersmith. In a sense, I wish that the authority was not Labour controlled, because I would have made exactly the same point as toughly had it been a Tory-controlled authority. Central and local government have great responsibilities here. I go all the way along the line with the hon. Member for Brightside. It is dangerous to start thinking, "Well, it is only one person. The general good is much more important, and we should follow that." That is why we must follow in the parliamentary tradition of always being prepared to stand up for the individual. That is how to protect people in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 is the nearest we can get to making sure that everybody is aware of the issues which are raised when a council decides to refuse to carry out what the ombudsman asks it to do. I do not believe that we can safely enforce the ombudsman's adjudications, because it would have a great of downside which we cannot support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the proposal made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith that we should allow people to go to court, because they can do that anyway. Often, the ombudsman takes up a case which is not legally winnable, but which can be won on the basis of morality and natural justice. In those circumstances, applying to the court would not be helpful. I hope that the Committee will agree that, although not perfect, this is the best that we can do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that there are many wool shops there, so the Minister had better not tempt me too far. I was about to make the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) on his behalf, but he may wish to catch your eye, Mr. Hunt, and speak on points that I raised on clause 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous debate between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) revolved around the best way in which to deal with an ombudsman's decision that found against a council. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
Minister seemed to assume that the ombudsman is always right and the council always wrong, that wisdom is always on the one side, and that it is imperative that, rather than leave it to the court to decide who is right and who is wrong, we must embark upon a procedure that puts the public spotlight on what he thinks is a council's wrongdoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the council does not always do wrong. As the debate between the Minister and my hon. Friend revealed, there are different ways of interpreting the same event. There were two points of view in the Coventry case, which I do not know in detail. The district council in my constituency lets out sports halls which it owns. It is the council's policy to let the halls to individuals or groups on the same basis, which means that everyone is charged the same fee. Many sporting clubs take advantage of it. One, which deals with martial arts and has an expensive administrative structure across Scotland—it has a national ruling body and employs national coaches, which makes it an expensive club to run—applied to the district council to use the sports hall. The council agreed, as long as the club charged people who used the club the same fee as it charged anyone else who used the hall. The club wants to add extra charges on account of its extra expenses as a club so, instead of paying 50p an hour, people have been asked to pay £2.50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is conflict between the council and the club and both think that right is on their side. The club has told me, "The council cannot dictate to us what we should charge," and the district council has replied, fairly, that no one is allowed to use its premises for commercial business, and that if the club uses council premises it must charge people the same as the council charges. My point to the Minister is that even if the council called in the ombudsman, he would not necessarily solve the problem because both sides believe that they are right and it is difficult to decide one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we adopt the procedure that the Minister suggests, all sorts of problems will arise for councils, especially in Scotland and particularly in my area—Dundee—where there is a tradition of the D. C. Thomson press. I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with 	<i>Beano</i> and 	<i>Dandy,</i> but the 	<i>Sunday Post</i> and the 	<i>Dundee Courier and Advertiser</i> are very Right wing and anti Labour. We have a tradition of Labour-controlled councils in Dundee which are traditionally attacked by those papers. I recall a large picture and a banner headline over a dub—sort of hole in the pavement with a puddle in it. It became a major story because of press attacks on the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's approach is followed, those local newspapers could attack Dundee district council, often unfairly, simply because when there is right and wrong on both sides of a case, the ombudsman shades on one side. The matter could be made political by enemies of the Council's administration and the report might be used unjustly or unfairly in those circumstances. That is the danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29A(1) imposes a restriction on councils. It says in effect, that the function of considering the ombudsman's report cannot be delegated to any other committee, but must rest with the parent authority—the council itself. Tayside regional council has an economic development committee to which is delegates various functions. The advantage of that committee is that it consists of councillors from Tayside region, of those from district councils in the area and also of representatives of trades
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
unions and local business. If someone is in dispute with the economic development committee, the best forum for resolving the dispute may well be the committee itself. It does not enhance the Minister's case to argue that the matter should be referred to the full council because district councillors and business and trades unions representatives could not be represented on the full council. In any event, the economic development committee receives as much press coverage as the full council. There is no real difference when it comes to making an issue public, the public can equally follow what goes on in that committee as it can follow what goes on in the full council. The provision is not entirely relevant as it has not been framed with full understanding of how Scottish local authorities operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that there are district councillors on the committee, would it qualify as a joint committee under subsection (3), which states that the restriction will not apply to joint committees? Would the economic development committee be exempt from that restriction? Could it be a forum for discussing the ombudsman's report, or would that have to be referred upwards to the full council, thereby excluding district councillors and trade union and business representatives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29A(2) refers to the education committee and the same argument applies. The education committee consists of regional councillors and representatives from the different teachers' unions and church representatives. The Minister should know that the Catholic church has a special interest in education committees, as it has its own distinctive rights in the local authority education system. Separate Catholic schools have a special remit in the education committee. If the ombudsman's report must go to the full council, that will exclude representatives from the Catholic church, the Church of Scotland, teachers organisations, and so on, from discussing it. Surely that cannot be right. Or, do such committees fall within the definition of a joint committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29A(4) means that an authority cannot deal with an ombudsman's report merely on the basis of its own internal report. It must consider also
	<br><blockquote><p>"a report by a person or body with no interest in the Commissioner's report."</p></blockquote>
In other words, an independent report, as it has been described. Will the Minister say what that means? Is it a report by the complainant or one that the council would commission from independent consultants to put the case for and against the council? If it is the latter, is the council expected to pay for that independent report rather than deal with the matter in-house through its own officers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29A(5) says, in effect, that anyone named in the ombudsman's report cannot vote on the report. As the Minister knows, the convenor of a social work or education committee may be the person legally responsible for what happens within that department and he may also be an elected councillor. Suppose that someone has a complaint against a school and takes it to the education authority. Surely it would be unfair if the convenor of the committee were debarred from participating as an elected councillor when the full council decided on the ombudsman's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has been framed without real understanding of how Scottish local authorities operate and of the problems that might arise if it is enacted. I hope that the Minister will respond to all the matters that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The independent person was mentioned earlier when the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) was in another Committee. The position in Scotland would be the same as in England and Wales. The independent person might well be the monitoring officer of the local authority or any other independent officer who had not been involved in the original case. It is not a question of extra expense, except in terms of the officer's time. It would mean someone looking with a fresh eye at the details of the case so that it was truly and separately re-examined; no 	<i>amour-propre</i> would be involved, with that person defending his own earlier decision. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will not consider that too unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An economic development committee might well be a joint committee, depending on how it was set up. For example, it might be a sub-committee of the council, in which event it would be appropriate for the whole council to carry out the task. It might be a joint committee between the council and another council, in which case the joint committee regulations would apply. The question would depend entirely on the internal arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education committee is a sub-committee of the council; it would not be a joint committee in that sense. The hon. Gentleman knows how careful I am personally and the Government are about considering the rights of the Church in such matters. The Church of England is in a similar position in England on education provision as is the Roman Catholic Church in England, Scotland and, indeed, in Wales. We have defended and protected the rights of the joint providers of education—for example, they have voting powers that are not enjoyed by other co-opted members. The hon. Gentleman and I are not divided on the importance of that. Roman Catholic representatives, for example, would not be excluded from discussing the ombudsman's report because initially the report would go to the education committee. The committee would discuss it and no doubt the council would note the views expressed, especially if they were specific and appropriate because, say, the Roman Catholic Church has a particular interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a reason for it the report going to the full council. Things may be different in Tayside, but people usually look to the full council when it comes to major issues of reporting, for example. Moreover, the reports are serious. We probably all agree that when the ombudsman makes a report, especially if it is critical, it is important for the full council to recognise it. That is because it reflects on the council. Usually, the council would wish to express its view. On a rare occasion when it seemed appropiate, it might be decided not to do what the ombudsman said. Surely such a decision is so serious that it should be made by the full council and not under delegated powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East made a fair point about a named individual being unable to take part—for example, the convenor of the education committee. I do not claim to have read every local ombudsman report but I am told that if that were done, it would be seen that the ombudsman extremely rarely mentions a person by name. When that is done—it is extremely unusual—it is because a significant personal statement is made about that person. In those circumstances, surely it would not be proper for someone who was singled out in a significant and unusual way for praise or blame—it might be all right for praise, but not for blame—to particiapte in proceedings and a vote which centred on a statement made about him. It is right
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
that such a person should be able to express his side of the argument, but it is not a good idea that he should be able to vote in such circumstances. Indeed, it would be unlikely that he would consider it proper to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East suggested that we should go back to the courts. As we are talking about Scotland, we can forget the natural sharpness of our earliest argument about Coventry. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would be as worried as I am that in an issue centred on, for example, Tayside regional council's moral responsibility, a court could not take a strictly legal decision because the ombudsman had made an impartial judgment that Tayside's action was not illegal but unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East cited the fascinating case of the martial arts committee. I accept at face value what he said about the problems that may arise. He did not suggest that those involved took the case to the ombudsman or that they intend to do so. In such circumstances, when there is a justifiable feeling by both parties that natural justice should be on their side, a council must be extremely careful in deciding that it must be the judge in a case in which it is one of the supplicants. Who, in the end, decides? I am unhappy with the view that the council's judgment must be better than that of the individual involved. On the other hand, I do not wish the council to be legally overruled because the ombudsman's decision is final and enforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the council decides not to agree to the independent report, it should do so clearly and publicly so that those to whom the council is responsible—the electorate—are aware of it. That is why the clause is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East should be aware that I am under pressure from some of my hon. Friends to make the proposals enforceable. I am unhappy about that because it would undermine the position of local government. However, I recognise the difficulties that there will be if the local press is antagonistic. Many hon. Members have suffered from the antagonism of their local press. The hon. Gentleman will accept that the major organs of Scottish opinion are not wildly enthusiastic about the Conservative Government. There is a wide range of views to choose from in Dundee. If people do not like the 	<i>Dundee Courier and Advertiser,</i> they can buy the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> or 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> Many people read the 	<i>Dundee Courier,</i> which I am sure is an excellent newspaper. People are not fools, however. They know a newspaper's bias. They have to live with it, and so does the council. A newspaper may not be wildly enthusiastic about the Tayside District Council, but it is still better for the issues to be fully covered so that people in Tayside can make up their minds about them. The hon. Member for Dundee, East must admit that despite the efforts of the 	<i>Dundee Courier,</i> members of his party have been returned to Parliament in both seats in Dundee, having previously held only one. The position is not as bad as he makes out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must draw a distinction between a local paper such as the 	<i>Dundee Courier</i>—it is read by almost everyone in Dundee because it contains local news—and national newspapers such as the 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 	<i>The Scotsman.</i> People understand that the 	<i>Dundee Courier</i> is a Tory paper, but when it presents a case in strictly human terms of someone suffering because of a council's maladministration the public can easily be misled about the true nature of that council's ability to carry out its functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If something is not to be made justiciable and enforceable by law, the only way to ensure that a council weighs carefully a decision to ignore the independent advice of an ombudsman is to make it public and to insist that the whole council, and not only the original committee, take part in the decision. An officer other than the person who made the original recommendation or decision must consider the issue and present a report. That is the furthest that we can go without making the proposal enforceable. I hope that it will be successful because if it is not it will be impossible to fend off the pressure to make the ombudsman's report enforceable. If that is to be avoided, local government must be careful about the way in which it handles the ombudsman's reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause is generally welcome. A code is already included in the standing orders of most local authorities or in members' handbooks. Local authorities want guidance on matters such as how to deal with members' non-pecuniary interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could make a long speech about whether the Secretary of State is fit to lay down a code of guidance for local authorities, but I shall not do so because I concluded long ago that he was not fit. Subsection (4) states that the code will be laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament. Will that be in the near future? It relates to the joint local authorities association and the Department of the Environment working party which was to consider the issue. I understand that that working party has not met. I would be anxious if that were so because its views should be taken into account. The clause refers to the importance of consultation so I know that the Government agree with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A code would be useful, as several instances show. There have been some unfortunate breaches of the code by Conservative councillors in Portsmouth, but I shall not refer to them. I merely let it be known to the Minister that the Government cannot get away with the game of batting

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The availability to members of the public and intereseted parties of local authority agendas and papers relates closely to the image, and therefore to the conduct, of councillors. Vigilant watchdog groups will keep on eye on them to guard against the shenanigans to which the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a deficiency in the Local Government Act 1972. The law states that journalists must have access to such papers, and that a local authority must supply them with the public sections of its agendas for its committees and for the full council, and with the accompanying papers if they are public. However, a member of the public has the right only to go to his local authority, inspect the documents and take copies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislation does not lay down what a local authority may charge a member of the public for photocopies. That is an open invitation to secretive local authorities to say, "You can take photocopies but we'll charge you five quid a sheet," or some other excessive figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a member of the public or an interested party tells a local authority that he would like all the papers relating to, say, its education committe and that he is prepared to pay the postage, he makes a reasonable request that should be granted. As the law stands, local authorities are under no obligation to provide the papers. The deficiency hinders people who went to keep a careful eye on the conduct of committee members and councillors, and it should be examined. Will my right hon.

Much has been said about injustice and people's rights and how, when people are aggrieved, the ombudsman can put matters right, but we have heard nothing—apart from what my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said—about local councillors or members who feel aggrieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the Local Commissioner is satisfied that it would be unjust to do so, the report shall name the member and give particulars of the breach".</p></blockquote>
Frankly, I do not believe that the ombudsman is infallible. There have been occasions on which the ombudsman has reported a so-called injustice in my local authority, and we have not agreed with his decision. He has clearly considered the case, but he has not come up with the right decision, and the situation will be made worse if he is given the power to name an individual member, because that will put pressure on local authorities, and certainly on individual members. That is not right, unless the individual member has the right of reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
We have heard a great deal about the right of reply in the past few weeks in the House of Commons. There has been a Private Member's Bill and private motions on the subject, and it is generally felt in the House that anyone who is criticised in the press should have a right of reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are dealing with a local councillor who feels that he has been made a scapegoat and that the ombudsman has not made the right decision. If he is named, there is nothing in the Bill to say that he will have the right to challenge the ombudsman's decision. Surely he should have the right to challenge the ombudsman if he feels that there has been a gross miscarriage of justice. He should be able to put his case forward in court and oppose the ombudsman's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the member is found to be right and the ombudsman has published the name wrongly, it should be possible for the court to award the member costs or damages for the injustice that he has suffered by being named in a newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) is right when he says that, at present, the local ombudsman does not name any members—he calls them X, Y or Z—but under the Bill the member can now be named in the press. That is my point. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has not read the clause, or perhaps I have misunderstood it; I am not quite sure which.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood it. It happens only where the opposing sides—the council and whoever is appealing—agree. It has never happened to my knowledge, and I cannot see that the clause will change it. I feel that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy for the Minister to intervene now and tell me that the Bill does not say that, but my interpretation is that it says that the ombudsman can name a person. In other words, he no longer has to call him councillor X, Y or Z. If it does not say that, there is no argument. If it reads as I think it does, my argument is correct, and a local councillor should be able to contradict or appeal against the ombudsman's decision to name him.

If there has been a miscarriage of justice against an individual councillor, he should have the right to be awarded costs or damages, if his case is proved.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) and I will not agree on this. I stress, first, that we are talking about a breach of the national code of conduct. We may have lost sight of that in this short debate. I am not talking about maladministration in the round; I am talking about a breach of the national code of conduct that leads to maladministration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman stretches credulity to breaking point when he says that the local councillor will not have the right to reply. I should like to see anyone trying to stop that councillor commenting on such a report. Moreover, as the council itself would have to consider the ombudsman's report—this is the key point—and it would do so in council, the councillor involved could comment at that stage. So there is that forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no quarrel with the system. It can be a useful mechanism for keeping local councillors on their toes. A breach of the national code of conduct is a serious matter. If the ombudsman has gone as far as to decide to name an individual, it is right, fair and proper that he should do so. The fact that that provision is enshrined in the Bill will deter councillors from considering a breach of the code of conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Member for City of Durham will not agree with me, but I ask him to accept that the provision is a deterrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 3</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>REPRESENTATIVE BODY AND FUNDING OF COMMISSIONER</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'(1) Section 24 of the Local Government Act 1974 shall cease to have effect.</p>
	<p>(2) In Schedule 4 to the Local Government Act 1974, the following paragraphs shall be substituted for paragraphs 6 to 11.
	<br><blockquote><p>"6. The Secretary of State shall defray the expenditure incurred in any year by each of the Commissions.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>7. Before exercising his powers under paragraph 6 above, the Secretary of State shall consult such associations of local authorities as appear to him to be concerned."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>(3) Each of the Commissions shall prepare a general report of the discharge of their functions in each financial year and shall arrange for its publication.</p>
	<p>(4) Before arranging for the publication of a report under subsection (3) above, the Commission concerned shall give a reasonable opportunity for such local authority associations as appear to it to be concerned to comment on it, and if any comments are made shall (when arranging for the report to be published) arrange for it to be published with an annex containing such of the comments as the local authority associations concerned consider appropriate.'.—[	<i>Mr. Soley.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to be brief as we shall have an important debate on clause 25, but I do not wish to minimise the importance of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in an earlier intervention that we need to review the ombudsman system, not least its funding. New clause 3 would impose on the Secretary of State responsibility for funding the ombudsman. At present, there is a curious system whereby local authorities have to fund the ombudsman although he has to investigate them. Many local authority commissioners are at present asking for
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
additional resources. It is not appropriate that local authorities should just have to pay up when the amount is decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 3 would make it incumbent on the Secretary of State to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"defray the expenditure incurred in any one year",</p></blockquote>
to consult local authorities about the expenditure and the powers and to allow them to comment on the reports of the local authority commissioner. The new clause would enable local authorities to put their side of the case. As the Minister said, it is a matter of opinion whether local authorities behave properly. There may be a case for allowing them to comment on the content of a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for a more general review of the way in which the ombudsman system is working. On the whole, it is satisfactory, but there are inadequate aspects of it for complainants, local authorities and other groups. The commissioners are arguing for additional powers and resources. Everyone recognises the need to examine the working of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary aim of the new clause is to make it clear that the funding of the ombudsman should be a responsibility of Government rather than of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with subsections (1), (2) and (3) of new clause 3, but I regret that subsection (4) might have intolerable consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a report is prepared under subsection (3) of new clause 3, the commission must give a reasonable opportunity for local authority associations to comment. When the commission publishes its report, it must include
	<br><blockquote><p>"an annex containing such of the comments"</p></blockquote>
not that the commission considers appropriate but
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the local authority associations concerned consider appropriate."</p></blockquote>
We can easily envisage an annex that outweighs by many pages the report itself. It might be highly satisfactory that the commission should have a duty to give local authority associations an opportunity to comment, but it would detract substantially from the rights, powers and privileges of the commission if it were bound to rehearse in an annex every word that such local authority associations might utter by way of comment on the draft report before it was published. While I have sympathy for subsections (1), (2) and (3), I have none for subsection (4). The good that the other three would undoubtedly do would be substantially reduced by subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the Committee. We hope to bring forward later a number of the concepts behind clause 3. We want to restate some matters that have been underlined in the new clause, but not in a way that would undermine the commission's agreement to provide an independent study of the organisation and management of committees which will provide a sound basis for assessing future staffing and finance requirements. The commission came to an agreement about how it will levy funds for the coming year because there was disagreement this year, and an arrangement was reached between local authorities and the Commission for Local Administration Local Government and Housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with what the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) said about the need to look at the system's operation. The commission has responded. I should like to examine the independent report to see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
whether it has covered everything before I suggest that anything further might be done. I suspect that enough will come out of that to meet what the hon. Gentleman will agree are his minor, although important, worries. I understood him to say that, in general, he is happy with the way it works but feels that some items ought to be re-examined. I hope that the report will deal with them. If both of us feel that it does not, there will nevertheless be an opportunity to act. I will keep an eye on the matter and give him my understanding of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to continue the practice of local authorities funding the Commission for Local Administration, but in a different way, which I hope will meet some of the hon. Gentleman's worries. There is a slight difference between us, but it is not of great import. I shall not go all the way with the new clause because that may cause problems. I echo the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) about subsection (4). I am sure that the hon. Member for Hammersmith does not wish it to end up as drafted. With that reservation, if I assure the hon. Member for Hammersmith that I intend to come back to the subject in a way that he will not find too difficult, although it may not be exactly what he would like, perhaps he will withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful response. I accept that there may be ways of interpreting the new clause that would widen the debate and that perhaps we need a different type of debate. I say to the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), that although we want to avoid a huge annex being produced, I envisaged local authority ombudsmen arguing the case in their reports for an expansion of staff to undertake other tasks. Given that a local authority would also be asked to pay the bill, it is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
bit much that it cannot give its views. The new clause was intended to deal with points that are no more horrendous than that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and Clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. The pace of progress has been so fast that I did not have time to intervene. May I clarify a point with you? When are we resuming this afternoon, and in which room?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will resume at 4.30 p.m. in Committee Room 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr Hunt. As the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) is not present, it might be for the convenience of the Committee if we ajourned now. I am always anxious to help Conservatives when they get into difficulties, especially as we have made such fast progress that I have managed to overtake Conservative Whips as well. I must put that on record. I am sure, Mr Hunt, that you would not deny me that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I can help the Committee. I can fill in time by announcing that I have received a note that we must leave our papers here at lunchtime. They cannot be moved into Room 9 until 4.20 p.m. If we wish to leave our papers behind, we should leave them here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
