	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 538, in page 69, line 1, at beginning insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to get it right this afternoon. I apologise to members of the Committee because they will have to listen again to what I said this morning, although it will be slightly abridged. I wondered why there was so much shuffling and bewilderment this morning. I am pleased to be speaking on the right set of amendments now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unfair for my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am grateful, too, to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who did not have to do what he did. I hope that I shall be able to return the compliment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, though, I must say that this is one of the most despicable proposals that even Marsham Street could imagine. I hope that Ministers will think again about the ring-fencing that they propose before the Bill goes to the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who take responsibility for their families and their neighbourhood should—indeed, they would want—to contribute towards management costs, debt charges, and the residual expenses of sheltered housing for elderly people and expensive adaptations for people with disabilities. Special housing is more expensive and falls on the Housing Revenue Account, which we discussed briefly this morning. We must consider which warden schemes should fall under the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Revenue Account has been ring-fenced so that ghettos are created. In them, one third of tenants are responsible for the benefits and costs of the other two thirds, who receive income support under the housing benefit scheme. Ministers at what was the Department of Health and Social Security and at the Department of the Environment made it clear to local authorities that income
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
support was no business of theirs and that they should not be engaged in education grants or benefits to support the local community because that was the responsibility of the social security system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Bill will remove the housing benefit system from council tenants and transfer it to the housing revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as later clauses reveal, the housing benefit system will be taken away from council tenants and transferred to the Housing Revenue Account, to be designated a housing cost rather than an income support cost falling on the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that Ministers have a rational reason for making the small and dwindling number of council tenants, who can afford full rent, responsible for the ring-fenced benefits and residual costs that arise from community provision, to which we should all contribute and for which we are all responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government spelt out three reasons as justification for ring-fencing—the desire to improve the efficiency and accountability of local authorities, the desire to improve the efficiency of central government resource allocation and the desire to influence the level of rents. They clearly reveal the Government's intention, but the last is the true reason. The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment struggled to find the right words this morning, but it is increasing rents, not necessarily to a set market level but to one related to housing sales, arising from the right-to-buy legislation, and the landlords' charter—the so-called tenants' choice; it is hard to remember such an Orwellian term—which are at the centre of this proposal. The measures will force those who can afford to pay full rents to opt out of the system to survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the hon. Gentleman to think that my suggestions this morning would all result, after consultation with local authority associations, in a rise in rents. There could be a recommendation—that is probably as far as it would go—for a fall in local authority rents. Will the hon. Gentleman seriously consider that—if not now, perhaps a little later when he has the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise the Minister that, if there is a fall in rents, I shall publicly welcome them and commend him for his common sense and vision for providing housing at rents that people can afford rather than forcing them into a benefits system which, for private sector housing, would be paid for by all of us, in the housing association sector would be paid for by all of us, but in the case of council tenancies would be paid for by other council tenants. It would ensure that people do not fall into the nightmare and poverty trap of claiming, but it does, and increasingly will, result in people just above the benefit threshold—those who are not so badly off and are affording their own rents, who are in work but are struggling to make ends meet—bearing the burden of paying benefits for their neighbours. It amounts to that. These people are always hit because they are just above that crucial poverty trap level of receipt of income support and benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly incredulous about the Minister's offer to think about reducing rents because, this morning, Ministers told us that rents have been too low and that local authorities are responsible for having subsidised rents unnecessarily—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "In some cases.". Some authorities have tried to provide rents that people can genuinely afford. Only £500 million has been going into housing subsidy at a national level. To be exact, the figure is £450 million. As that goes to only one quarter of authorities, and only one quarter of the housing authorities that receive housing benefit make a contribution from the general fund to the Housing Revenue Account, we can hardly be talking about many authorities being able to subsidise rents, as Ministers say, by contributing from the rate account. We are talking about a small number of authorities. It is interesting to compare the £450 million with the increase in mortgage tax relief in the past financial year. That increase was £750 million, which brings the total to £5·5 billion, not £450 million. Lowering rents would give more money back to people in exactly the same way as does tax relief on mortgages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would welcome that because it would provide equity and fairness as between different housing sectors and different types of tenure. We are in favour of fairness and justice. The Government are proposing the opposite. While council house tenants pay rates, and will pay the poll tax, they will be discriminated against vis-à-vis those in housing association, private landlord or owner-occupied accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman leave council tenants on housing benefit out of the equation of subsidies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two sorts of subsidy. One that goes to everyone in whatever tenure, which is housing benefit, and the other which is for housing costs and known as housing subsidy. That is clear and understood by my 12-year-old son. If he were here, he would be on our side and not on the hon. Gentleman's in terms of grasping the significance of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might be used to speaking to people in the Labour party who do not understand the difference, but we clearly understand it. The hon. Gentleman's equation is £5 billion or more in subsidies from tax relief—money that people would otherwise have paid out of money earned—and the £450 million that go on housing subsidy to local authorities. The hon. Gentleman has not mentioned the large sum of money that goes in housing benefit to council tenants. Surely that must be part of the same equation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tax relief on mortgages reduces the amount people have to pay which reduces their housing costs. Without that tax relief, they would pay more. The issue is straightforward. Housing cost support from central government is seen as an important contribution to housing needs. I mentioned some towards which local authorities make a contribution from the general fund, very often because they receive no subsidy at national level—75 per cent. do not. Many Conservative authorities have been making a contribution to the Housing Revenue Account from the rate fund as have Labour authorities. They include well known radical Socialist authorities such as Kensington and Chelsea, Barnet, Harrow and others which are known to be on our side in placing value on the need for decent, affordable public housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
What is the justification for saying that, for council tenants, there will be a holding operation for drawing together the combination of national housing benefit, which is paid for and on behalf of council tenants, and not to the local authority or the housing department, and whatever contribution is being made from the authority's revenue account to the Housing Revenue Account and, as rents gradually increase, it will be reduced until it is eliminated? Ministers have made that aim clear for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill incorporates that concept. It provides that, when there is no subsidy from the Government, authorities will be able to contribute outwards from Housing Revenue Account to poll tax payers—at that point only, not before. There are good reasons why the Government do not want it to happen before, given the scheme that they are about to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that concept is clearly on record and the intention is to phase out the national subsidy, who will pick up that part of the subsidy that is currently paid direct as income support to tenants on housing benefit? It will be those council tenants who remain such and who do not receive any benefit. It has to be those who are paying full rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a twist in the tale here. Eventually, if the Government get their way and sufficient people take up their right to buy, or opt out to housing associations or private landlords, the national bill will increase as they continue to receive personal income support housing benefit, and the number who were in the benefit scheme within the Housing Revenue Account will increase to a point where the Government will have twisted around and eaten their tail. No one who was not entitled to a benefit that they repaid themselves would be in public sector housing, because they would be the only people paying into the Housing Revenue Account. The Government would not be paying because they would have phased it out. The local authority would not be permitted to do so through poll tax payers or the successor option that we shall introduce. They will not receive a local subsidy either, so who will pay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that, eventually, the one third who are paying full rent will dwindle to one sixth, one eighth or one tenth, and the burden upon them will become greater until there is almost saintdom for the few people left in each street who will be directly responsible for social needs housing for the remainder of the community. That is the bizarre effect that these proposals will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were it not a serious matter, were people not at the receiving end of the proposals and were communities not washing their hands of the housing benefit payment for a large part of the community generally, we would think that it was a bizarre joke, but it is not, and nor is taking away the local contribution from people who are in other forms of sheltered or special needs housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we oppose clause 64 and the subsequent clauses which change the system unnecessarily. They do not increase efficiency because higher rents do not equal efficiency. Nor does it lower spending on housing. We have seen the dangers of that, under Labour Governments as well. A lack of investment has resulted in greater costs later in picking up the disrepair, deterioration and lack of interest in investment in stock, whether from subsidy or from rentpayers. It was said earlier that local authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
housing management has much to be proud of in terms of cost and effectiveness vis-à-vis other forms of tenure, including housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On each count, the proposals are not only unacceptable in terms of housing—they are unacceptable because of their impact on individuals and on families. I note what the Minister said earlier about the need always to be mindful of the impact of legislation on the wellbeing and rights of individuals. It is not acceptable to believe that what is ideologically correct overrides considerations of the consequences for those who turn out to be the victims. I challenge the Minister to say why the Government believe that their proposals will not create ghettos, increase the poverty trap and penalise council tenants on full rents, and will not segregate council tenants from people with all other forms of housing tenure—owner-occupiers, housing association tenants or private landlord tenants. The personal income support that they receive allows them to pay affordable rents and maintain their dignity, and ensures equality, fairness and justice in society, instead of a society based on the desire to eliminate the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) will be surprised to hear that I disagree with him, but I shall disagree with him politely because he and I know that we are to share a platform tomorrow in Sheffield, when I undertake what is known as the topping out ceremony on the Meadowhall project. If he will be gracious enough to withdraw these ridiculous amendments, I might be tempted to give the hon. Member an honourable mention when I speak in Sheffield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We enjoyed the action replay of the hon. Gentleman's speech, which we heard for the first time this morning, but he did not deal with the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), who clearly understands the clauses and went to the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggests that tenants who are not on housing benefit will have to pay all the costs of those who are on benefit, but he has overlooked several important facts. He seems to have forgotten that in any event, taxpayers subsidise public housing, and that there are two forms of public subsidy. There is the public subsidy in bricks and mortar, and the public subsidy by way of housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will remember, from debates that he has had with my hon. Friends about the community charge, that, under the future régime, when community charge is introduced, the taxpayer will still contribute to local authorities, to the tune of 50 per cent. of the income that they will receive, even for the general fund. Higher taxpayers will pay a disproportionate amount of that tax, although I have no quarrel with that. It is unfair for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that existing tenants will have to shoulder the burden. The new housing subsidy, which he did not mention, will come from the Department of the Environment, and the subsidy will be financed yet again by the taxpayer, so the hon. Gentleman is mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to tenants paying other tenants' benefits, surpluses on the account, where they can be assumed to arise for subsidy, will first help to meet housing benefit costs—and why not? The Government make the subsidies to which I have already referred. Secondly, the cost of sheltered housing falls to the Housing Revenue Account, but the cost of welfare support services does not. That is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
cost to the taxpayer. In the admissible cost limits system, extra allowance is made for extra cost of specialised dwellings, so that will be picked up by the subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my local authority, we put into the Housing Revenue Account what we call a welfare contribution. We run a sheltered housing scheme with a warden-control system and a central computer. That is currently subsidised through the general rate fund with a contribution of about £500,000 because we believe that as a central control system and warden scheme run by the local authority benefits the whole of the community, not just council tenants, everybody should pay for it. Is the Minister now saying that only council tenants should pay for that central, warden-control scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying—I think that this is the clearest litmus test that I can give to the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg)—is that if it is a welfare matter it is out of the Housing Revenue Account ring-fencing, but that if it is a main line function of the local authority as housing landlord, then it can be in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister expand on that? The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) has hit upon an important issue which has arisen in my own local authority. The advice from the financial staff of that authority is that rents must now cover the costs of the warden service in council-run accommodation. The tenants in such accommodation are naturally very upset at having to pay those bills. If the Minister is right, I am sure that my local authority would be interested in reversing its decision. But I am not altogether sure that he is saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot put it any more clearly. Several local authority associations are currently raising this precise matter, and we are having discussions with them. The definition that I gave is the litmus test that we proposed to the local authority associations, but it is still subject to discussion. Dependent on those discussions, we shall look at it more carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister's litmus test, but I am not clear as to what it means. Will he elaborate a little more on the distinction, so that hon. Ministers here can judge for themselves how it might apply to their own local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that a number of examples, some of which I am prepared to give to the hon. Gentleman, may be in the grey area. That is a good reason for us to be talking to the local authority associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that if it was a welfare matter, it would be out of the Housing Revenue Account. If it is a straightforward housing landlord function, then it is in. Those at the margin are play areas, gardens, open spaces, grounds, district heating systems, community alarms, footpaths, roads and lighting. Perhaps the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) can suggest others that we might consider—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Warden service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the warden or caretaker service is provided as a main housing function by the landlord, my understanding is that it is in. If it is a social service—that is, a welfare service—then it would be out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister define "welfare" in the way that he means it, or in the way that it is being determined by his Department?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Durham example, the warden controlled care system provides for council tenants and for the private sector. In other words, those who live in their own home and are over 60 can come into the system, which thus provides a service for both. Unless the Minister allows a welfare contribution to be paid into the Housing Revenue Account from the general rate fund, council house tenants will pay for a service that the private sector also uses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is giving the Committee the impression that because a service does not come under the Housing Revenue Account it cannot be provided, but nothing could be further from the truth. That is not what we are saying. I merely say that there must be a clearer picture of how efficient housing management is in a local authority. As a result of this and a number of other clauses in the Bill, the ring-fencing of the Housing Revenue Account will make it a darn sight easier to understand how efficient an authority is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can assist the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) further. I do not carry in my head the Oxford dictionary definition of the word "welfare", but I shall look it up if I find time this afternoon. There is another litmus test which may assist him and the hon. Member for Truro. The present proposals in the Bill mean that wardens, who deal directly with people, would not come within the Housing Revenue Account ring-fencing whereas caretakers, who deal with buildings, would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a bit of luck, the Minister may have gone some way towards answering my question with his final comment which seemed to show that wardens would be counted to fulfil a welfare function. All of us who are non-technicians on the subject would describe a warden service as a welfare service, but we are not sure whether civil servants viewing it technically and bureaucratically would come to the same conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Gentleman prepared his intervention before he heard my substantive reply as I have answered that question. If the services deal with people they are outside Housing Revenue Account ring-fencing, but if they deal with buildings they are within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At last, the Minister is clarifying what the Bill could mean in practice and I am grateful for his comments about caretakers. He says that they will be caught by the legislation, yet his Department has said that caretakers are essential to the management of flats, tower blocks and so on, because they deal with people. Is he telling the Committee that councils will not be able to employ caretakers under the Housing Revenue Account as a result of the Bill? That seems to be the implication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now clear to me that the hon. Gentleman does not understand this part of the Bill. It might suit a local authority to have a service in the ring-fencing and I shall try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, if we try to balance what is within the Housing Revenue Account with the rents drawn in by a local authority, many local authorities would not be in balance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
without the new housing subsidy. By using a synthetic index, we shall calculate what the new housing subsidy should be on an authority-by-authority basis. We must take into account the needs of a particular area. The synthetic index would need to include a number of criteria which I have suggested, especially in last Thursday's debate. They may favour some local authorities in inner-city areas, but especially those in the midlands and the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to a point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside, I envisage that Sheffield city council could be assisted by the new regime of new housing subsidy. As I tried to make clear in past debates, the money drawn down by capital receipts from the sale of council houses may appear to be high in Sheffield but, pro rata, it is not high compared with some districts in London. We are having to supplement investment in housing improvement in difficult council estates in Sheffield by making funds available for estate action, community refurbishment schemes and so on. That is ridiculous. It means that the present legislation is operating unfairly towards those authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) made a fair intervention, but he must not run away with the idea that it is necessarily harmful in all cases for something to be within the ring fence. That will have a direct bearing on the calculation that we shall have to make to reach a figure for the new housing subsidy which has to be made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had to leave the Room and I apoligise if this point has already been dealt with. There is a Huyton community co-operative for the elderly situated in the consituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. Hughes). The scheme consists of bungalows and flats for the elderly and is funded by housing associations grants. It straddles the boundary with a local authority scheme for the elderly, so that the two schemes are back to back. The organisers have sensibly taken the view that the co-operative's management and maintenance allowances could contribute towards the cost of a warden. The Minister is fond of saying what an efficient borough Knowsley is, and this is an example of its efficiency. The warden is being used on two schemes: the community co-operative for the elderly and the other funded directly from the Housing Revenue Account. I accept that this is a tricky question, but how will the contribution from the co-operative count under the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one analyses the hon. Gentleman's question carefully, one comes back to the provision of a warden, and I have already dealt with that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not know that. Under the definitions and proposals in the Bill, wardens are outside the ring fence of the Housing Revenue Account. Caretakers—they are not relevant to the hon. Gentleman's example—are inside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's comments on estate action projects and similar schemes, but they are not central to the issue. The Minister said that I have not grasped the new subsidy that will be available. If there is to be the subsidy that is currently paid under housing benefit as on income support to tenants, if, at least for the first year, a note is to be taken of the average rate contribution to the Housing Revenue Account, and if there is also to be the £450 million in the current subsidy scheme—which is to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>871</span>
become part of the new subsidy scheme—where in the public expenditure predictions, the Bill or anything attached to the Bill is there any extra money? As I understand it, the new subsidy system is the existing system revamped with the same revamped money. If that is so, irrespective of individual authorities which may find that temporarily they have benefited, the new scheme will have exactly the effects that we have described this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not so sure about that. The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that the various programmes that I have catalogued—the top of the list is estate action-constitute additional funding. As I tried to show earlier, their aim is to correct the imbalance in the sums that can be made available to a local authority to spend on the most difficult estates. The hon. Gentleman is right there. I would term that top slicing. But the hon. Gentleman must not assume that as a result of the changes in this part of the Bill we intend to do away with such top slicing. It may be necessary—I choose my words carefully—for us to recognise that there are particularly difficult estates in some inner-city areas which have to be treated in the same way. I do not wish to delay the Committee by talking of the advantages of estate action, but all hon. Members must agree on how successful that programme has been, with central and local government working in partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must try to convey to the hon. Member for Brightside that any increase is likely to come in the new housing subsidy. We shall have to calculate—I do not pretend that it will be an easy calculation—some means whereby we may recognise the demands on the Housing Revenue Account that are fixed and those that are not. Those that are fixed are the rent and loan charges. The management and maintenance of the stock may be variable, and the housing management of a local authority may decide that it is spending too much or not enough. On the other side of the equation are the rents, which are fixed on an annual basis. We must ensure that the equation is balanced. In the majority of cases it will not be balanced, and it is unlikely that there will be a surplus in the Housing Revenue Account. As we know, a contribution is often made from the general fund to the Housing Revenue Account, which is misleading to tenants and does not state clearly how efficient the local authority's housing management is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must calculate on a local authority by local authority basis what the new housing subsidy should be. I can tell the hon. Member for Brightside and his hon. Friends that we intend to start from the present position. It would be difficult and in many cases penal to start from the position that we would like, and many local authorities would be brought down if we decided that from 1990 there would be no transfers from the general fund to the Housing Revenue Account. That would put some local authorities technically into liquidation. We shall start from the present position and the shortfall will have to be made up with a contribution from the Department of the Environment which will be calculated in a new way. It will be called new housing subsidy. That money will be provided by the Government and originally by the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent a lot of time on these amendments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The implication is that the Department of the Environment will manage the new housing subsidy. The Minister spoke earlier about caretakers who would fall within the ring-fence. Is he suggesting that local authorities that want to employ caretakers as part of their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
management must obtain permission from his Department to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying no such thing. No one could come to that conclusion without stretching credulity to breaking point. I shall try to give the hon. Member for Leeds, West another interpretation of what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment has a clear responsibility to consider carefully and to discuss with local authorities precisely how their Housing Revenue Accounts are being run. If the Department of the Environment is not satisfied with the way in which a housing authority is running its affairs, that will be borne in mind when calculating the new housing subsidy. There is nothing wrong with that. However naive this may sound, I assume that the vast majority of local authorities will run their affairs more efficiently as a result of the changes in the legislation. We are not penalising but taking into account a number of factors in the synthetic index to which I referred. The hon. Member for Leeds, West is familiar with them because they appertain in Leeds, where perhaps in the past he made representations to us to take them into account. They will be included when we calculate the new housing subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to take this opportunity to question the Minister as many local authorities are worried about ring-fencing. If my interpretation of what the Minister says about welfare contribution is correct, I am delighted, but I am not certain what he means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, a genuine welfare contribution will not be ring fenced. Can we go a step further? If an authority is providing a service for the private sector and is paying for it out of the Housing Revenue Account, could that service be completely removed from the Housing Revenue Account and transferred solely to the general rate fund because there was a contribution from the general rate fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the Housing Revenue Account is to assist public housing. We cannot make that any clearer. If local authorities wish to assist activity in the private sector and choose to take money from the general fund, they will have to explain their reasons to their community charge payers. They may be able to do so if their actions are eminently justifiable, but for goodness sake let us not try to use the Housing Revenue Account for developments in the private sector. The account is set up specifically to deal with public housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When any of my hon. Friends uses the word "delight" I wince when I realise what is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two questions. First, will a welfare payment be the contribution that is made through the Housing Revenue Account to the higher costs incurred on debt charges, because of the expense of a property and therefore the original higher investment, or on the management costs of running it, for example, as a sheltered scheme for the elderly or as a particular type of property designed for someone with a severe disability? If that is a welfare cost we need to know so that it can be taken into account. Secondly, if it is not, what will happen if, on behalf of its community, an authority provides a grant from poll tax payers to a private-sector scheme, trust or housing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
association to help it undertake an expensive project of that sort?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is easy. The grant would come out of the general fund. The answer to his first question is equally clear. Within the Housing Revenue Account there would be three segments. I have already referred to them, but let us go through them again. There will be management and maintenance, rent rebates and loan charges. The hon. Member for Brightside is asking me a specific question about loan charges and they will come out of the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the equation, all we see at present is rents. I have not checked on Sheffield's figures, but I will be happy to do so if the hon. Member for Brightside wishes. The amount of money received from rent may not be high enough to cover the cost of the three charges, so to balance the equation the remainder would have to be provided through the new housing subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the other side of the equation there would be not only rents but, for example, service charges. How will service charges in a block of flats where there is a mixture of council tenants and owners be dealt with under the Housing Revenue Account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) is saying that the services charges being drawn in and the building are the responsibility of the local authority, that would be another form of income over and above the rents. I have referred to that, but I shall explain again. In many cases, when the equation is balanced there is likely to be a shortfall which will be made up by the new housing subsidy that I keep mentioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thought suddenly dawns on the hon. Member for Brightside that it is not too bad a package. As it is clear that my smooth and engaging chatter may be persuading him to withdraw the amendments, I can be extremely nice to him when I am in his constituency tomorrow. Hope springs eternal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the equation has been presented as a balance, with the three elements on one side and the rents on the other. But there is a crucial flaw in the Ministers argument, because rent rebates are being fused with housing benefit—admittedly in a later clause. In our discussions in Committee on the Social Security Bill, the Government decided that if a local authority paid people in private landlord accommodation housing benefit above the level that the Government had agreed, the authority would not get back that money. The housing benefit loss will come out of the other side, so it imbalances the equation. In that way, people in council rented properties will subsidise people in private rented properties who are paying high rents to private landords. That is the real equation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is complete nonsense. Now we are getting back to private rented accommodation. I understand exactly what the hon. Member for Leeds, West is saying, because we had a debate on this subject on the Floor of the House only a fortnight ago. It is true that housing benefit, which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Security, would not be available for private rented acccommodation that was valued above the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
market rent. What he says on that subject is true, but housing benefit in that respect is paid for by the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are doing extremely well, because I have at least three Opposition Members with me, and even if they do not vote against their hon. Friend's amendment, at least there is a greater understanding of what the clause seeks to do The hon. Member for Leeds, West must not disrupt the Committee's proceedings by taking us back to private rented accommodation, which I can assure him has absolutely nothing to do with the Housing Revenue Account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentlemen will explain how.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have hon. Gentlemen's encouraged to explain something that is not part of the amendment. We cannot debate housing benefit at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with you, Mr Hunt. As the hon. Gentlemen said, there will be an opportunity to return to the matter later, and he and I will both welcome that future debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted for the 27th time, I was saying to the hon. Member for Brightside that, as the idea now appeals to him, he must think that there is a catch somewhere. There is, and I shall spell it out slowly. The catch is that local authorities will have to manage their Housing Revenue Accounts much more efficiently than they have done in the past, in the light of what they receive in subsidy and what they think that they can obtain in rents. So inefficiency will result in higher rents—or a poorer service, because we must not forget the management and maintenance part of the equation. In either case, the authority will be accountable to the tenants. The present system is accountable neither to the tenants nor to the ratepayers. We shall stop this silly business of ratepayers who are contributing to the general fund—but only to half the general fund—subsidising the Housing Revenue Account, if they did not know it. I suspect that the vast majority of them do not know it. In my opinion, that is an absolute disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that council tenants are also ratepayers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I am responding to what the hon. Member for Brightside and his hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) have said time and again. It is as if tenants who are not on housing benefit only are making a contribution. When we debate housing, the Opposition forget the taxpayer, and in most cases tenants are taxpayers. Under the new housing subsidy, the taxpayer will remain a major contributor to efficient local authority housing management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is implying that the general ratepayer is subsidising the council house tenant in contributions to the Housing Revenue Account. Earlier it was stated that the taxpayer also subsidises the private householder. Millions of council house tenants are taxpayers who subsidise private householders. What is wrong with ratepayers subsidise mortgage interest tax relief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. The figures for mortgage relief and rent subsidies are almost equal. In 1987–88—the latest figures that are available—£5 billion was paid in subsidies, but four to five times as many people were owner-occupiers, so proportionately more goes to the tenants. I am grateful to the hon. Member for City of Durham for raising the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document "Housing Facts" published by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, states that in 1978–79 the Exchequer subsidy was £1·2 billion. It dropped in 1988–89 to £496 million. At the same time, subsidies to home owners in mortgage interest tax relief rose from £1,450 million to £4·25 billion. There has been a gradual decrease in housing subsidy from the Exchequer and an increase in the subsidy to home owners. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities document contradicts what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not. The hon. Member for City of Durham and I were talking about subsidy in the round. I am pointing out how much the taxpayer has to fund. We are talking not merely about bricks and mortar, but about benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but it does not matter what the hon. Gentleman is talking about, I am talking about housing benefit too. The hon. Gentleman should be pleased that the Government recognise that under the 1988 Act there is likely to be a substantial increase in taxpayer-funded housing benefit. The hon. Gentleman has not taken that into account. I move not one jot or tittle from what I said in reply to the intervention from the hon. Member for Leeds, West. My comparison stands the closest scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments were tabled to sabotage our proposals on the ring fencing of the Housing Revenue Account. They are designed to destroy it. In contrast, we believe that it is time that those who are served by housing management within local authorities had a clearer understanding of their efficiency. Opposition Members do not seem to think that tenants should know that. But why? This offers an opportunity for local authorities—which the Opposition argue are always so efficient in housing management—to show how efficient they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must disappoint the Minister. He has not convinced me or my colleagues one jot or tittle. There is a little equation to answer. It is one of those little riddles that I used to hear when I was at my grandfather's knee. When is income support not income support? When it is a housing cost within a ring-fenced Housing Revenue Account. It amounts to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not object to giving tenants more detailed information about comparative or actual costs of the running of their housing authority or to giving people information about the unit costs in their area and how that compares with best authorities elsewhere. Indeed, we shall introduce a quality commission to undertake the task of spreading good practice and information, but we shall not penalise people and create victims of a system that will give greater power to the centre, that will allow Ministers to determine rents and confuse income support with old, intermediate or new subsidy schemes. Whatever they are called, they amount to the same thing: Less money for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
housing and income support being confused with housing investment programmes. It is an issue about which the whole Committee should be worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members who are convinced of the present ideology have a guru called Friedrich Hayek. He said that obligations can exist only to known and identifiable individuals and not to society as a whole. The Bill will eventually result in people carrying that ideology to the extreme—their obligations will be seen to exist to identifiable neighbours whom they will subsidise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment inserts new
	<br><blockquote><p>"Item 1: Income from proceeds of disposals"</p></blockquote>
and ties in closely to amendments Nos, 488 and 491, which have been tabled by Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 535 seeks to maintain the status quo. The Housing Act 1985 clearly allowed credit from interest on the housing capital receipts to go to or from the Housing Revenue Account. The objective was to eliminate debt. The amendment seeks to retain interest from housing capital receipts as a credit to the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the Bill's overall intention to insist that capital receipts are for the large part used to repay outstanding dept, there will still be some interest earned that will need to be allocated to an account. I shall be interested to hear how the Minister defends his position if he does not accept the amendment because there is no logic in allocating this interest to the general rate fund account. It is clearly housing money that should be retained for housing purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling the amendment I am using exactly the same wording that is contained in schedule 14 of the Housing Act 1985. The Minister will know that at present a council is free to invest revenue and capital receipt money, pending its use, either internally by reducing the authority's overdraft of with outside institutions, such as banks and other local authorities, and to credit the interest earned to its Housing Revenue Accounts.

I understand that Lord Caithness has written to the chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities' housing committee stating that interest earned from the usable part of Housing Revenue Account capital receipts—25 per cent.—will be credited not to the Housing Revenue Account but to the general fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 488 and 491 are similar although slightly broader in intent than amendment No. 535. I hope that the Minister will accept amendment No. 535, but I have no quarrel with what the Labour party is attempting to do. I believe that in all logic the Minister should accept the thrust of the amendment because if he does not local authorities will find that hard to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not delay the Committee further. The intention of amendment No. 535 is self-evident and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some real sympathy with the suggestions made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). I shall not shoot them down on the ground that they will not work in the way in which the amendment is drafted because I understand what the hon. Gentlemen is trying to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the proposed new system, a number of words are no longer applicable. The hon. Member for Truro is saying, quite rightly that local authorities' borrowing is more complex than the simple business of saying that they want to do something and borrowing the money to do it. An authority either borrows money generally or moves it from one account to another. It would be nonsense to have money sitting in one account and to borrow externally to meet a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system introduces a more hands-off approach, which will be more satisfactory. That means that what the hon. Member for Truro seeks to do in his amendment, and explained so admirably, can be done under the regulations. The effect of the amendment is not in the Bill because that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>878</span>
would be inappropriate. The matters to which the hon. Gentlemen refers do not work in the new system in the way that he supposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister to say that the intention behind the amendment will be put into effect through regulations. I wonder whether that is so, and when the regulatory power will be published. I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment provided that we see the result of the Minister's assurances prior to losing the opportunity to return to the subject. I hope that my response is helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The situation is covered by the schedule. Item 7 of part I and Item 6 of part II of the schedule include references to the sums to be credited. The specific points to which the hon. Gentlemen referred are to be found in Item 7 of part I and Item 6 of part II. As I had to ask for the references, I am not saying, "yah-boo! I know them and the Gentlemen doesn't." The main outline is already included in the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know whether the Minister is disposed to accept amendment No. 488 because that would mean that we could move on quickly. I fear, however, that he is about to disappoint me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State will not have power to direct the way in which interest from investment income and from the proceeds of disposal is calculated and credited to the Housing Revenue Account. At present, councils are free to invest revenue and capital receipt moneys pending their use, either internally by reducing and authority's overdraft, or with outside institutions such as banks and other local authorities, and credit the interest earned to their Housing Revenue Accounts. That seems an eminently sensible thing for local authorities to do with floating cash for which they do not have immediate use. Surely that idea underpins the capitalist system. That being so, the Minister will surely allow local authorities to continue to implement it. It would be in the interest of ratepayers, especially those in council accommodation, that money earned be credited back to the Housing Revenue Account so that rents could be kept that much lower. It would seem to be good and sensible husbandry of resources that should appeal instantly to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Lord Caithness has written to the chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities' housing committee stating that interest earned from the usable part of the Housing Revenue Account capital receipts—at least 25 per cent. of them—will not be credited to the Housing Revenue Account but will go to the general fund instead. The amendment would reintroduce the provisions of schedule 14 to the Housing Act 1985, which currently governs the financial framework of the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will not accept the amendment because it goes completely counter to the Bill's provisions. I understand that. I should like him to explain in non-technical language, which I know he would prefer to do, the thinking and the philosophy behind the Government's approach. It seems sensible to ordinary, reasonable moderate people such as us that local authorities use money upon which there is no immediate call to earn interest by putting it into the banking system, and then
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>879</span>
putting it back into the Housing Revenue Account from whence originally it came. Receipts from it should be used to keep down rents. The cost of living would be eased, especially for council tenants. That would benefit wage demands and the retail price index generally. Why do the Government wish to force up council house rents? That is what the Bill's provisions would do. We have suggested a way in which council house rents could be kept down without causing concern elsewhere. Will the Minister explain to a poor, humble seeker after truth the purpose of the Government's plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The temptation is irresistible. I am sad that the poor, humble seeker after truth did not include in his recent article in 	<i>The House Magazine</i> an entire paragraph about his constant seeking after truth within and outside the parliamentary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is substantially as the hon. Gentleman described it, and we shall probably agree on most aspects. The money may have been in the Housing Revenue Account at some stage, but it did not originate there. Much of it came from the taxpayer and the ratepayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) is correct. It would be silly to have money sloshing about without earning interest. The question is what to do with the interest. If it is put into the Housing Revenue Account, the effect is automatically to increase the resources of that authority, compared with its needs, and therefore to decrease the subsidy that it would receive. That provides no motivation to put the money on deposit so that it can earn interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the interest did not have that effect on the subsidy, local authorities that had large sums of money that they could allow to gain interest would receive a disproportionate amount of the subsidy that was available, irrespective of their needs, because the subsidy would be unaffected by a substantial part of their means and their needs would not have increased. Similarly, an authority that did not have much money on deposit would find that the amount of subsidy that it received was diminished by the fact that another authority was receiving subsidy, even though it was earning considerable interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why interest gained is put into the general account rather than the Housing Revenue Account. That is a reasonable arrangement. It enables us more accurately to give
	<br><blockquote><p>"to each according to his needs".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand part of the Minister's argument, but he has not told us the whole story. The money goes into the general fund, but if the Bill is passed the Housing Revenue Account will be ring fenced and it will not be possible to transfer the money from the general acccount to the Housing Revenue Account, to peg down rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister left it at that, there would be no need for the amendments, but he wants to have his cake and eat it, and we cannot accept that. I understand the Minister's argument about local authorities which, for historic reasons, can produce a surplus on the Housing Revenue Account sufficient to enable them to invest that money and still continue to attract grant from the Government. Of course, that could affect other local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>880</span>
However, is it not within the wit of the Department to ascertain from local authorities how much money they have invested from the surplus on the Housing Revenue Account, and to take that into consideration when levels of grant are calculated? Local authorities are required to give large amounts of information to the Department, and I am sure that in the Department there is a section—nay, three or four floors of people—which knows precisely how much a local authority earns in interest on moneys kept in various financial institutions. That knowledge would allow calculations to be made. That answers the Minister's first fairly valid point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see that that would help us very much, as it would mean that the amount of interest would merely be taken into account and the subsidy would be reduced accordingly. No local authority would be encouraged to put money on deposit because if it earned, say, £200,000 in interest, the subsidy would be reduced by £200,000 when it was taken into account. That would not be a sensible way of encouraging local authorities to put money on deposit. If the money were put into the general fund there would be a straightforward issue of how the subsidy was targeted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attempting to avoid answering the questions of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West. On this occasion there is not much between us. The issue that could be between us is not this part of the mechanism but the amount of subsidy that is targeted. We probably agree that we should target the subsidy more effectively but what we might disagree about, if our past track records are anything to go by, is what the total of the subsidy should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that comes between us is that I believe, as it seems likely did Dick Crossman, that the way to help those who are unable to pay for housing is through the housing benefit system. That is why the £2 billion that goes in that direction is better than the £450 million of housing subsidy or the £400 million in interest currently paid into Housing Revenue Accounts from housing receipts. Those are rough figures. The difficulty is that if the rents are reduced in council areas in certain parts of the country, irrespective of the means of those who pay those rents, resources will be used in an inefficient and thereby unfair and uncompassionate way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer that the necessary help should be provided through the housing benefit system. We should ensure that the housing subsidy is used in the best possible way, and that means real help in targeting maintenance needs, for example. The hon. Gentleman and I know well that the difference in maintenance needs varies considerably throughout the country. It is better to recognise that than to distort arrangements because a local authority happens to have a lot of money on deposit by being in a part of the country with a historic pattern of housing provision which has enabled it to realise considerable housing receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that there does not seem to be much between us on this issue. We might disagree, however, about the size of the housing subsidy and the housing benefit scheme and the means whereby it is controlled. It is reasonable to argue about those matters but I do not think that we should fall out over this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had a chance to read the relevant sections to which the Minister referred. It is always advisable to take such an opportunity in Committee before

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Always a temptation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, it is always a temptation. I have no doubt that he feels that it applies to my party in particular. However, this may be an opportunity to prove that we are all equally vulnerable. The problem is that it does not guarantee that anything will be done. I asked the Minister when he would deal with the problem that I raised and he said, "It's all right, it's in the Bill." But what is in the Bill is simply the power to do something; it is not a guarantee that anything will be done, or any clue about what will be done. Before I withdraw the amendment, could the Minister be a little more expansive in his response and say whether he agrees with my argument that interest earned on the housing side should be allocated to housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to deal with an intervention which began by the hon. Gentleman saying that the Bill allows us to have something both ways but does not make it compulsory. The temptations that the phrase have raised in my mind are such that I can hardly answer the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman invited us to apply his remarks with particular force to the Liberal party, and that left me almost—but unhappily not entirely—speechless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go through with the hon. Gentleman the details of why it is so difficult to put such a complex formula into the Bill. We are discussing it with the local authorities. We have to deal with the pool rate and to reproduce the effect on the pool rate, without reintroducing obsolete concepts into the system. We would have to distinguish between the proportion of an authority's receipts that are available for spending and the proportion that must be set aside to reduce net indebtedness. I am sure that the hon. Member for Truro would not wish me to go through everything that has to be done. We are consulting on the exact formula. It is complicated, but in due course we will produce it. I can guarantee that it will be done, so the hon. Gentleman need not worry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on restraining himself. In view of his final comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 565, in schedule 4, page 129, line 17, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>'Item 1: Homeless Transfers</i></p>
	<p>The Authority shall make a contribution from some other revenue account of the authority equal to the net cost of repair maintenance supervision and management of houses and other property used as temporary accommodation for the homeless as required by Part III of the Housing Act 1985.'.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the cost of homelessness is borne by the general rate fund and not paid by council tenants through the Housing Revenue Account.</p>
	<p>It is an important amendment. The priority of most councils is to get people out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The Minister is always keen to take a balanced view, and I am sure that all the best Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
councils do this, anyway, and move people from bed-and-breakfast accommodation into temporary accommodation, such as hostels. That may not be entirely satisfactory, but it is preferable to what we have heard both within and outside the Committee about bed-and-breakfast conditions. Any conscientious council will make efforts to remove people from the degradation of bed and breakfast accommodation.</p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>However, the Bill appears to offer a disincentive to such initiatives. It says that money to pay for the repair of temporary accommodation is to come out of the Housing Revenue Account, so that the one hope of giving people a decent standard of living will have to come from an already over-stretched budget. The money for bed-and-breakfast, by contrast, comes from the general rate fund so that everyone—rightly—within a local authority area contributes to the cost of homelessness. If expenditure on bed-and-breakfast comes from the general rate fund and expenditure on repair of temporary accommodation comes from the Housing Revenue Account, many councils will be forced to make greater use of bed-and-breakfast instead of seeking alternatives. My interpretation may be wrong, but that seems to be the distinction and the Committee should not allow that to go through.</p>
	<p>I remind the Committee of the reference in the Audit Commission report to temporary accommodation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The use of temporary accommodation is unavoidable if at any one time there are more acceptances of homeless applicants than there are available lettings of permanent housing."</p></blockquote>
It states of bed-and-breakfast accommodation that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The comparative costs will vary from area to area, but as an example in one authority visited, which had over 100 households in privately leased schemes, the cost was less than one-seventh of the net cost of B&B hotels. The net revenue cost of a hostel unit may be only one-third of the cost of B&B.</p></blockquote>
It also states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if all authorities in the survey using B&B used at least 50 units of the other types of temporary accommodation, then 54 per cent. of them could stop using B&B altogether and the number of households in such accommodation could be reduced by 12 per cent.;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If they all used at least 100 units of the other types of temporary accommodation, then 71 per cent. could stop using B&B altogether and the number of households could be reduced by 23 per cent."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>I am worried that in distinguishing between the two, there is a direct disincentive to making the change that the Audit Commission recommended, at least in some local authorities. The amendment covers that and I look forward to the Minister's comments on it.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be able to convince the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Revenue Account covers the provision of housing, whatever its purpose, and it is difficult to understand how it could be decided that it should be used in one way or another. The Housing Revenue Account covers the provision of housing and if there were a void, albeit temporary, it would be used because it was available, and it would have to be paid for in any case. The resources would clearly come from the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question is how needs are measured and how provision is made for those needs. The Housing Revenue Account will include some provision for combating homelessness, both in allocation of capital spending and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>883</span>
subsidy for loan charges on that capital spending. That will be in the Housing Revenue Account for that purpose. If a local authority provides for homelessness outside that Housing Revenue Account, the funds will come from other resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why there should be a disincentive. One sometimes wonders why local authorities do not use some of their resources; they seem sometimes to prefer the more expensive route or do not have their act together. But I do not understand how the changes in the Bill will make that worse, and I would have thought that they would be an incentive for them to manage their stock more effectively. Sometimes the pressures are greater than local authorities like, but the pressures are intended to make it clear that better management of the housing stock will benefit local people and the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system should ensure that there is every advantage in putting homeless people and others in need into available property instead of leaving it empty or taking a long time to convert it. I cannot see any disadvantage in that and it is reasonable to accept that the cost of providing such housing should fall on the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the hon. Member for Truro may be that more money should be spent on this or that, or that greater allocation is required for homelessness needs in capital and loan repayments. That would be a perfectly reasonable argument but would not be affected by the amendment. His proposal is not sensible and would be almost impossible to operate. I do not understand how we can tie a tag to the homeless to drag with them a sum of money from another source. Surely it is much better to ensure that the necessary money to deal with them is in the Housing Revenue Account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The crunch of my argument is that bed-and-breakfast costs will come out of the general rate fund. If we are spending large sums on bed-and-breakfast accommodation and the Housing Revenue Account is fully allocated, we shall be unable to put homeless people into the more desirable and cost-effective temporary accommodation that the Audit Commission highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be no problem in theory as civil servants allocate funds and earmark money for temporary accommodation. In reality, when a council's budget has been expended the authority may be unable to get money from its Housing Revenue Account to set up temporary accommodation and be forced to continue to spend money on bed and breakfast. The amendment attempts to tackle that undesirable consequence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the amendment would work as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I can envisage circumstances in which he would complain that in their allocations the Government were not taking sufficient account of the need to spend on homelessness, but it would be odd to provide capital allocations for spending on building for homelessness outside the Housing Revenue Account as he suggests. His proposal would create another pocket, outside Housing Revenue Account, from which to make allocations for building. Councils could spend money on building only under a capital allocation. They could find money for that purpose only if they had it as an allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more rational to have the money in the box that we are discussing. Then it would be perfectly reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to press us to ensure that there is adequate allocation. We may disagree about allocations,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
but it is not helpful to say, "To ensure that capital allocations are adequate, we shall provide another pocket from which to make them. That will somehow make them more adequate." I do not understand that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) understand if we say that it has been the policy of both the Conservative and Labour parties that homelessness is not a separate issue from housing policy in the round? He seems to be arguing the point drawn out by the Audit Commission that bed and breakfast is an extremely expensive way of housing the homeless. If we dealt with the issue within Housing Revenue Account ring fencing and if, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, stock were brought from the void sector back on to the market, what would be a clear mark of the efficiency or otherwise of a local authority's housing management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely do not understand how the proposal will help the problem. If accommodation is available in the Housing Revenue Account, it is to a council's advantage to use it. It will provide extra income from rents and diminish the cost to the council of bed and breakfast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If accommodation is needed but not available, the sensible solution is to have capital allocations in the right place—the Housing Revenue Account. Whatever party is in Government, the argument between Government and Opposition should be to ensure that capital allocations are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no dispute between us on the desirability of spending money and of councils making the best use of Housing Revenue Account resources, voids and so on. The difficulty is that councils will have to decide on whom to spend the money and how to do so. There will be many different pressures but one group—those in bed-and-breakfast accommodation funded by the General Rate Fund—will be entirely separate. Whatever provision is made for the homeless will have to eat into the various options that are available, but so long as those people remain in bed-and-breakfast accommodation the provision will not eat into the housing options. My worry is that people will be left in bed-and-breakfast accommodation while the money is used for other purposes, because the money comes from the General Rate Fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever there is a need to spend finite resources—they exist within and without the Housing Revenue Account—it is obvious that in so far as they are spent on one thing, they cannot be spent on another. I do not see that the hon. Gentleman is right to say that spending on homelessness by means of the expensive and improper route of bed-and-breakfast would not eat into other accounts, in the sense that they are outside the Housing Revenue Account. As I say, if the money is spent in that way, it cannot be spent in some other way, and therefore it is to the advantage of the local authority to use it within the Housing Revenue Account. If the amount of housing subsidy is not yet fixed, surely it is to the hon. Gentleman's advantage to campaign for extra money to be made available to deal with homelessness. It is much better for that to be within the bag that is there. It is better for that pressure to be on the Government than on some other specialist fund outside. That is the sensible way to do it, and I see no advantage in doing it the other way round. The

Local authorities would benefit from being certain about the circumstances in which the powers will be used and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
extent of any determinations that may be made. There is an element of uncertainty in the Bill. The Government seem confused and the amendments seek clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) tabled the amendments. Directions can already be made under the housing subsidy manual. It has been accepted by Labour and Conservative Governments that when there are complications, such as changes in circumstances, housing policies and programmes and even architecture, directions are needed. There must be a proper comparison between one Housing Revenue Account and another because the amount of subsidy and the Government's ability to meet the needs of the local authority depend upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tottenham and I are anxious about those local authorities that have greater needs than others. It is in the interests of local authorities that have great needs but not great resources that the system is fair and the playing fields level, to use that appallingly popular phrase, so that they get their fair share of the available funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rule of thumb is that a Housing Revenue Account should contain all the factors that relate to being a landlord. If the question is asked, "Would the local authority need to make such expenditure if it were not a landlord, if it did not own housing stock", and the answer is yes, such expenditure should fall outside the Housing Revenue Account. But if the answer is no, it should fall within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might use that rule of thumb in the confines of the Committee, but it is not possible to include it in statute in that simple form. As the hon. Member for Tottenham wished, I shall give examples. Item 2 relates to charges for services and facilities. Clearly, there are some borderline cases such as the warden service in sheltered accommodation, the concierge in blocks of flats or the provision of advice to homeless families. The direction-making power, which amendment No. 485 would delete, will allow rules to be made, if necessary, to cover those cases. Everyone would work on the same basis but there could be great variations between one authority and another. They might need to be dealt with at the beginning of the changeover or could perhaps be left until much later. Others may be merely de minimis and need not be altered. It is reasonable to have a direction-making power to cover such matters. The purpose is to ensure fairness between local authorities, not to penalise anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Item 4 of the same part of the schedule covers contributions paid by outside bodies to the authority—for instance, in respect of nomination rights or when the activities of a statutory undertaker impose costs on the authority. Such contributions are often by way of compensation for specific items of expenditure and they would naturally fall to be credited to the account which bore the expenditure. But the direction-making power, which amendment No. 487 would delete, is there for difficult cases. Otherwise, it might not be possible to make proper decisions in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Item 1 of part II of the schedule covers expenditure on repairs, maintenance, supervision and management. Again, the amounts to be charged will mostly be self-evident, but the direction-making power, which amendment No. 490 would delete, will be available when necessary to deal with marginal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>887</span>
Paragraph 3 of part III of the schedule allows an authority to make transfers across the ring fence into the Housing Revenue Account in respect of amenities, the cost of which is borne on the Housing Revenue Account but which provide a benefit to the community at large — for example, open spaces on a council estate. Authorities in general have well established rules to determine the wider community's share in such cases, but the direction-making power in paragraph 3(2), which amendment No. 495 would delete, is available as a backstop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Tottenham that the purpose is merely to retain in the subsidy handbook the powers that we already have and use. They are not meant for anything other than ensuring that there is a fair deal between local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 489 is especially odd among the others in the group. It would remove the Secretary of State's direction-making power that gives him the right to allow a local authority to make transfers across the ring fence. Suppose that a local authority was in trouble because circumstances had got the better of it and that it would be unreasonable to expect it to recover on its own. That authority might apply to the Secretary of State for a special direction to allow the ring fence to be breached, so that it could draw on its other resources to rescue the Housing Revenue Account. The power is needed to answer such a request. If the power did not exist, we should have to say, "Tough cheese." A responsible Government should not have to treat a local authority in that way. That is why the power is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to rescuing the Housing Revenue Account.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, it would be possible, under the direction-making powers, for the Secretary of State to allow the local authority to breach the Housing Revenue Account ring fence. No doubt the moneys used would come from a range of different pockets and from other means of raising money. If the direction-making powers were not provided and if the amendment were put into effect, we would create a system that was incapable of individual relaxation when everybody agreed that the relaxation should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am merely saying to the hon. Member for Tottenham that I am confident about the Bill and in the ability of most local authorities to deal with their problems properly. However, I have been in politics long enough to realise that surprising circumstances arise. I do not believe in ever saying "never". It is not possible to say that there will never be a case in which circumstances will arise—for example in Housing Revenue Accounts—when rules will need to be breached. I want us to respond sensibly and therefore it would be wrong to remove the ability which I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On reflection, Opposition Members will probably feel that any Government ought to have direction-making power, but they want to be in a position to blame the Government for not using it in circumstances in which they fell that it should have been used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 457, in page 129, line 34, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>'Item 3A rent rebate subsidy'</i></p>
	<p>'Rent rebate subsidy payable to the authority for the year under Part II of the Social Security Act 1986 to the extent that it is calculated by reference to Housing Revenue Account rebates within the meaning of that Part.'.</p>
	<p>Earlier in the debate, when the Under-Secretary stated clearly the brackets of the Housing Revenue Account and how it should balance, reference was made to three items: loan charges; management maintenance and rent rebates. The purpose of the amendment is to insert the following into schedule 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rent rebate subsidy payable to the authority"</p></blockquote>
will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated by reference to Housing Revenue Account rebates within the meaning of that Part"</p></blockquote>
when the Bill is enacted. The purpose is to ensure that the rebate subsidies are linked to a separate rent rebate subsidy which is credited to the Housing Revenue Account. In other words, we must ensure that payments in housing benefit do not sink the rent account because the Housing Revenue Account could be sunk if incoming rents have to subsidise the payments that go out in housing benefit as a result of claw back by the Government. Payments are made through the local authority, which submits returns and asks the Government for the housing benefit that it has paid out.</p>
	<p>This is an important issue. If the Government include the whole of the rent rebate system in the Housing Revenue Account, tenants who are not on housing benefit will have to pay rent which will pay for everybody else, whether he or she is in council or private housing, who receives rent rebates.</p>
	<p>The Government are pushing the housing benefit system back to the local level and taking those who need housing benefit, and the entire housing benefit structure, out of governmental responsibility. They are pushing it right into the heart of the rent account of those who rent council houses. That is a profoundly unjust move which pushes in the direction of parish relief, for those at local level will administer the poor within their boundaries. That is the direction and intent of the clause if our amendment is not accepted.</p>
	<p>We seek to delete and amend to ensure that a separate rent rebate subsidy will continue to be credited to the Housing Revenue Account. In other words, that portion of the subsidy in respect of administering housing benefit will be credited to the general rate fund in accordance with the Bill as drafted because at present local authorities receive rent income from tenants and the Government reimburse councils. That mechanism effectively treats council tenants as it treats people in the private sector who receive housing benefit from the local authority and then pay their landlords. All are treated the same as regards housing benefit.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>The schedule as drafted would allow the Secretary of State to pay authorities less subsidy than the amount of housing benefit due to tenants. In practice, poor tenants would be subsidising poorer tenants.</p>
	<p>Sometimes it is difficult to take all the Government's legislation together. However, it is important to keep an eye on the Social Security Bill, which is in Committee in the other place. Changes have been made to that Bill. The Government now say that they will not reimburse local authorities which pay housing benefit to people who rent from private landlords who put rents above the level that rent officers decide is appropriate and recommend to the Government. If that happens, under the Housing Act 1980 local authorities will still have to pay the rents but they will not be reimbursed.</p>
	<p>We are entitled to ask where the money will come from. Under the present arrangement, it will come from within the new Housing Revenue Account structure because the deficit cannot be supported by the general rate fund.</p>
	<p>It is important to remind the Committee that rent rebates are part of a range of social security system payments. They are paid to council tenants who receive rent allowances and rent rebates. There are rent allowances for housing association tenants and private tenants and there are rate rebates for both tenant and owner occupiers. That is the range of subsidies and support systems.</p>
	<p>At present, the average repayment of rent rebate from the previous financial year is £15.37 per week. This is a substantial contribution to a person's income. It is estimated that 60 per cent. of council tenants receive housing benefit. Lest the Minister tell us that that is their fault, rather than quote from the debates on the Social Security Bill I remind the Minister that people receive housing benefit because they receive too little income in the first place, either because of low pay or because their pension is too low. The majority of housing benefit rent rebate claimants are pensioners, and there were 1.98 billion claimants in the previous financial year. It is they who will be affected by the provisions in schedule 4.</p>
	<p>I emphasise that housing benefit is means tested according to income. Claimants receive it because their income is too small and not because of their choice of housing. Their housing benefit will effectively be reduced because of the proposal that housing benefit payments come from the rents that come from the other source. The Under-Secretary spoke about this balance. He said that on the one hand there were maintenance, managements and loan charges and rent rebates, and on the other the rents that will be received. These rents will eventually pay for rent rebates. Unless our amendment is accepted, rebates will be excluded from being paid from the general fund as well. In a sense, we are making a special appeal at this stage because we shall disagree with the remainder of the schedule. We cannot let a situation arise whereby tenants in rented housing who are not in receipt of housing benefit have to subsidise the housing benefit costs of everyone else, whether in the private or the public rented sectors.</p>
	<p>The Bill proposes in effect to transfer the cost of rebates back to local authorities. I argue that that is a method of cutting Government expenditure at the centre. I hardly need remind the Committee that housing benefit has repeatedly been the target of Government cuts. Since its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>890</span>
inception in April 1983, expenditure on housing benefit has declined. It has been cut seven times since then. The latest cut—this month—gave rise to a debate in the Chamber earlier in the week. Conservative Ministers discovered the impact of that cut when constituents came to them and pointed out that they had lost assistance with their rent—on average, about £2.15 per week. The Government said that, as on the previous occasion, there would be transitional arrangements to ensure that the cut would be less damaging. Nevertheless, housing benefit has been reduced.</p>
	<p>There is a prinicple at stake. Previous Governments believed that poverty was a national, not a local, responsibility. That has been enshrined in our constitutional arrangements through the Budget ever since the Poor Law and the Speenhamland system. From the common Treasury, built up through taxes, we support the poor in our society.</p>
	<p>If the clause remains in its present form, the burden of alleviating poverty will be shifted back to the local level. The rent rebates for housing benefits will be paid not by the taxpayers in the whole of our society, but by council rent payers who are not on housing benefit.</p>
	<p>If the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) would listen instead of talking, he may find that his remarks about Speenhamland, which I can hear, are not accurate. If he wishes to intervene, I shall be happy to reply to him.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of historical fact, Speenhamland was a local Poor Law relief system set up by the magistrates at the Pelican Inn in 1797.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point. There was a move away from that, so that the whole of society would carry the burden of poverty. The effect of the clause will be a return to Speenhamland and parish relief, and people will be responsible for the poor in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the number of council tenants will decline, so the smaller number of council tenants who pay rent and do not receive housing benefit will pay the housing benefit cost of all the others. That must be the most unjust and divisive system, as it would divide society into the deserving and undeserving poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, the pressure on the Housing Revenue Account—the new system that the Minister offers us—will come from the shortfall in housing benefit, not from the shortfall in rents. I hope that the Minister will accept our amendment and remove the iniquity of the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be reasonable to consider the matter in the context of housing benefit, rather than on the basis of a document on green paper that seems to have been distributed among members of the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not need to go back to the Speenhamland system. Until 1972, local authorities funded their own rebate schemes. It was a period when the government or, as the then Prime Minister used to say, the governance of the country was in the hands of the Labour party and the Conservative party. The Bill does not represent a historic change. The real change has occurred since 1972, and it arose for various reasons and for no high-principled purpose. The Government paid general subsidies to councils as additional help with providing housing at a reasonable cost, by meeting general costs or providing rebates. When the national rent rebate scheme was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>891</span>
introduced, most authorities still qualified, in addition, for general housing subsidy to help with so-called bricks and mortar costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a huge change. We are discussing a system which, until relatively recently, always had those two elements. Over time, as authorities' historic costs were eaten away by inflation, as their role as providers of new housing diminished, and as receipts from the right to buy brought more benefits, fewer authorities needed Government help with housing costs. Today, only about 70 authorities—less than one fifth—claim main housing subsidy. Instead, authorities have been able to generate surpluses, which they have used either to hold rents down, underwrite inefficiency or subsidise rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems unnecessary to get hot under the collar about the matter, but when the rent collected by a local authority properly covers repayment of debt and maintenance of accommodation, let us imagine that a certain amount is left over. What should be done with that money? Should it be used, as it was by some Conservative authorities, to subsidise ratepayers? Would that be a reasonable use for it? I do not believe that it would be and have always thought that it was the wrong way to use such money. If the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) about what we should do with it are right, they must be quadruply right if the suggestion is that the money should be used as a general subsidy for ratepayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Leeds, West does not want the money to be used to hold rents down artificially. Surely he wants to ensure that those who need housing subsidy get it and that it is sufficient for their needs. He may argue with me about the level of housing subsidy or when people should cease to get it—that would be quite reasonable—but I am sure that he would not want me to suggest that those who live in council houses but earn enough not to get housing subsidy should pay rents which are artificially low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third use that could be made of the money would be to have a system which was more expensive than it would need to be for management and so on. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth possibility would be to remove the surplus from the local authority, but I do not believe in that either, as it is not sensible. What seems the best use for a surplus, which should not be created artificially, is that it should be applied to housing costs of which housing subsidy is one. That always happened when the system was regarded more rationally than recently. We have only to go back to the time of the Labour Government of the late 1960s and the Conservative Government that lasted until 1972 to see examples of that, so there is nothing terrible about that suggestion. It seems perfectly reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing benefit to private tenants would not be affected because the Housing Revenue Account is not affected. Tenants in the public sector would not be dealing with housing benefit to private tenants and, of course, community charge rebates for council tenants come not from the Housing Revenue Account but directly from the Government, so there are no problems in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what the fuss is about. There seems to be an attempt to create fear about a non-existent problem. We are merely saying that if a council's Housing Revenue Account is in surplus after it has met all its other needs, what is left could reasonably be applied to housing benefit.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
If it is not, the money will come from the taxpayer as it has done until now. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It comes directly from the taxpayer. We have said it over and over again. I am sorry, but the little green form that has been handed out to everybody by some organisation or other is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two brief points. First, does the Minister agree that, during the last decade, more and more expenditure on the administration of housing benefit has been borne by local government, as opposed to central government? That means that local government now bears a cost which it should not have borne in the past. Secondly, does he agree that the surplus in the Housing Revenue Account to which he refers, which he suggests is currently going back to the generality of the ratepayer, will effectively be going back to the generality of the taxpayer under his scheme? Money that will come from the Housing Revenue Account currently comes from the taxes paid to central government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only if the generality of subsidy were to fall. But imagine the circumstances—I am answering the second question—in which the needs of some areas grew while the surpluses in other areas also grew. It is likely that surpluses in the areas that created them would go towards housing, but the taxpayer might be forking out considerably more in other areas to meet needs that were not covered by any such surplus. Therefore, what the hon. Gentleman says would not necessarily be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I am saying to the hon. Member for Torfaen is that a surplus which in the past was used for other purposes should be used for housing. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will remember that the Department of Social Security pays a direct subsidy towards the administrative costs of housing benefit, although there is always an argument about whether it is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wealthy private tenants do not contribute towards worse-off private tenants on housing benefit, nor do better-off owner-occupiers subsidise the worse-off owner-occupiers, who are also entitled to benefit to maintain the interest payments on their accounts. Is it only public tenants who will have to subsidise public tenants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the London borough of Redbridge makes a £6 million surplus, transfers it to the general fund and puts up rents by 31 per cent. to make even more money and force more tenants out of the public sector. Whether it is right or not for them to transfer that money, would it not be unfair under the Minister's system for the better-off tenants in Redbridge to have to subsidise the benefit of the worse-off tenants? Is not that an inequity which the Minister will create, rather than iron out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the details of Redbridge with me, but if the Housing Revenue Account of any authority is in surplus to the tune of £6 million, it is rather an odd system which says that the £6 million goes back to the generality of the ratepayers in that borough while the Government take money from the taxpayer and put it into the housing revene account as a subsidy. It seems a very odd way to operate. It would be much better for the £6 million to go towards local housing purposes if there is such a surplus, so that the Government can put the taxpayers' money into places where there is a need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must accept that it does go on housing. The £6 million goes to housing benefit, which enables people who are otherwise too poor to pay their rents to get the money. I see no difficulty about this. The hon. Gentleman would be right only if one ignored all the other boroughs and places where the Housing Revenue Account is not, and will not be, in surplus and where the general taxpayer does what he ought to do—support the poor people of those areas who would not otherwise get the help that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is wholly fictitious and blatant politicking. If the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is wicked, the Government formed by Lord Wilson of Rievaulx was terribly wicked. The hon. Gentleman must also think that Mr. Crossman was wicked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can disagree, but it is not a question of Speenhamland systems. We are saying that if a council makes a surplus on its Housing Revenue Account it is better to put that money towards rent rebates than it is to spread it among the ratepayers. Most people would agree with that view, which to me seems uncontentious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not disparage the introduction of politics into the House of Commons. The Association of District Councils is controlled by his party, not mine. I also understand that a leading member of those involved in housing comes from the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Surrey, South West (Mrs. Bottomley). The Association of District Councils has deep feelings about this question, and feels that the Government should be financing housing benefit and that that ought not to be the role of local government. It is a Conservative body that is deeply interested in local government, but it disagrees with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has even more experience than me of the possibility of different groups of people within one party holding different views. There is nothing unusual in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I perfectly well understand that some people in local government—from my party—would prefer to continue the arrangement whereby the general taxpayer pays the cost of the subsidies. The local council, as a result, makes a profit on the Housing Revenue Account, and then uses it to subsidise the general ratepayer. I can see that, in electoral terms, that is much more convenient than our proposals. If councils think that, they are likely to use the argument of local determination and local government independence. I think that they are wrong, and that is why I disagree with the ADC'S advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments have to make decisions in the end, and sometimes they find that are not in accord with some of their supporters. That is not unusual, but I suspect that the Govenment experience that less often than the Opposition faces internal disagreement on their policies. The publication of each policy document is preceded, as well as succeeded, by denials by other groups in the party which do not like the decisions, but that is a characteristic of politics, and I have to accept it, as does the hon. Member for Torfaen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister ends with a most interesting remark. I know that his is not the Department involved, but he may care to reflect on the debate on the Fowler review that was the foundation for the Social Security Act 1988. This afternoon, the Minister has contradicted all that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
was in the Fowler review, which made it plain that income support, through housing rent subsidies, ought not to be treated as a main subsidy to housing. What the Minister is arguing is that income support through housing benefit is a housing subsidy and not an income subsidy. That is a complete shift away from what the then Secretary of State for Social Services said in the debate when he changed the system and argued that he was going back to Beveridge to recast and reframe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It helps if I do not have to shout, Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is arguing that income support is now a housing subsidy. That contradicts the statements of the Secretary of State for Social Security on the record of the proceedings of the Fowler review and the debates in the Standing Committee on the Social Security Act 1988. During recent weeks the same commitments were given along the Corridor in the Standing Committee on the current Social Security Bill—that housing benefit, like income support, would not be a subsidy to housing benefit in the way that the Minister suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point is that housing benefit is not fixed by the Department of the Environment and the Minister. It is not even fixed by the local authority. The amount paid to people in housing benefit in the rent rebate is fixed by means testing. That is why the Minister is claiming that it comes under his Department, when it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall press the amendment to a vote. It was interesting that at the beginning of our debate the Secretary of State said that rents would not rise, but it is now conceded that they will rise. When they rise, what will happen? The Department of Social Security has suddenly realised that those on housing benefit will have to receive more benefit. That will put pressure on that Department's budget and its demands on the Treasury. To close that loophole, council tenants who are only just above the level for housing benefit will have to pay income support to those who are below the level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be the effect of the clause and it should be spelt out.

Even at this late stage, we ask the Government to support us by including a provision that enables housing benefit contributions to be met from the general rate fund

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 451, in page 131, leave out lines 1 to 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 521 and amendment No. 544, in clause 69, page 71, leave out lines 11 to 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just discussed the fact that council tenants may subsidise housing benefit. As local authorities will be required to pay off debt from a proportion of their capital receipts as well as a notional rent increase, it is more than likely that many authorities will be out of subsidy in the medium term. The deletion suggested by the amendment would prevent further Secretary of State interference where a local authority has moved out of subsidy. The implication of the clause as drafted is that the Secreatary of State will continue to have significant influence on the level of individual local authority rents, even though an authority receives no financial support from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear both the Minister and the Under-Secretary refer to their new Housing Revenue Account system as the new regime. Occasionally the Prime Minister uses the term. She no longer speaks of the Government but of the regime. Some of us feel that we are now expected to live under a regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the guise of suggesting most of the time that powers have been decentralised to local level in a range of matters, the Government increase their power and Secretaries of State build in special permission to interfere and fix in the most detailed way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put the issue to the Under-Secretary. Earlier we had an exchange about the role of caretakers. He said that they were firmly within the Housing Revenue Account. While he was out of the Room his right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government used the French word and said, "But the Concierges,"—I am not sure of the difference between the two terms—"will not be within the Housing Revenue Account." Earlier I asked the Minister, "Is it really true that a local authority will have to go to the Secretary of State, who will personally comb through its Housing Revenue Account to determine whether it can have a caretaker in a particular block of flats?" That is what the clause provides, unless we make the proposed deletion
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>896</span>
and give local authorities power to handle their Housing Revenue Accounts when they are not in subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all we ask. I assume that the Under-Secretary will say, "At last we have a modest amendment," and be pleased to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman put his case modestly and I realise that he is trying to creep back into my affections, but his argument is based on a misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the hon. Gentleman has not mentioned the wording of the amendment. We have not heard the term "residual debt subsidy", with which his amendment deals. Has there been another mistake and are we debating the wrong amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The term is "leave out".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the amendment been withdrawn? Have you, Mr. Hunt, accepted a change in this regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating amendment No. 451. Amendment No. 486 was not moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, I did not hear anyone say that amendment No. 486 was not moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the decent thing and accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall immediately apologise to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and seek to creep back into his affections, but I shall not accept his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debit at item 4 of part II of the schedule is a consequence of clause 69. That clause governs the calculation of an authority's entitlement to Housing Revenue Account subsidy. As we will discuss in more detail later, to make our determinations we would look at both the income we thought an authority should be able to raise from rents and at what we expected it to spend on the Housing Revenue Account. The hon. Gentleman will recall that I specifically mentioned that aspect in relation to trying to balance the equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either the notional rental income exactly balances the assumed expenditure, in which case we pay no subsidy, or expediture is greater than income, in which case we pay subsidy to make up the shortfall. The third possibility is that the notional income is greater than the assumed expenditure. We determine, in other words, that the Housing Revenue Account will be in surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 69(2) and debit item 4 provide that in that case we would notify that notional surplus to the authority. The authority would then be required to transfer that amount from the Housing Revenue Account to another revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 540 and 451 and, if my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) wishes to move it, amendment No. 544, would remove those provisions. They would mean that while the Housing Revenue Account was in notional deficit we would pay subsidy to plug the gap, but that if the account was in surplus we would do nothing. The surplus would be left to accrue in the account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, that might seem fair, but what would happen to the surplus? The obvious course for councils to take would be to use it to keep down rents—Opposition
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>897</span>
Members see nothing wrong in that—but I have already explained why rents based on the simple historic costs in the Housing Revenue Account are unacceptable. They do not always represent a fair and realistic charge for the property, and they seriously distort the local housing market to the detriment of all local residents, so we cannot allow surpluses to be used in that way. Neither can we allow them to be used to provide extra levels of housing services. That would risk a distortion in the accountability that I described at length this morning. To allow the surpluses to stay in the Housing Revenue Account would encourage inefficiency and waste from certain authorities. We would be back where we started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 521 is a drafting amendment, standing in the name of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, to bring clause 69 into line with the drafting of the residual debt subsidy provisions in clause 72. It would remove the specific reference in clause 69 to no subsidy being payable to an authority that is deemed to be in balance or in surplus on the Housing Revenue Account. The clause would rely instead on the words "if any" in line 5, as does clause 72, to indicate that not all authorities were to receive subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 544—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where has the hon. Gentleman been all day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who follows the news will know that there has been a major shooting incident in my constituency, and I have been there talking to my constituents. I am sure that the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) will accept that as a reasonable excuse for my absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment that I move on behalf of the Institute of Housing, and for the record, I declared an interest, in that I am a consultant to that body. My hon. Friend the Minister has already sought to answer some of the points that arise, but there are a few more that I wish to put to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of the amendment is to ensure that the Housing Revenue Account surpluses are used to meet housing need. The clause provides that where a local authority's Housing Revenue Account subsidy is a negative amount, the local authority is required to transfer the equivalent positive amount from its Housing Revenue Account to its general fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of the transfer of specified surpluses does not seem to imply the freedom of action allowable to authorities to transfer revenue contributions to capital projects proposed in the Department of the Environment's capital expenditure consultation paper. I recognise that, given the end of local authority new build for general needs housing, the issue of present and prospective Housing Revenue Account surpluses must be addressed. My hon. Friend the Minister may argue that the amendment achieves only the same result as his proposal, but my alternative does it in a much more visible and acceptable manner, while earmarking certain moneys for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes). We have returned to the same point in different
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>898</span>
ways on at least three occasions. I do not accept the amendment because it moves away from the underlying prupose of this part of the Bill, which is to have a correlation between the efficiency of the local authority and the Housing Revenue Account which is clear to both tenants and ratepayers, who will soon become community charge payers. My hon. Friend's amendment would destroy that clear correlation—that unmistakable line between the Housing Revenue Account and the efficiency of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Institute of Housing wants me to fence a particular part of the clause but, as Mandy Rice-Davies said, "They would, wouldn't they?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed by the brilliant way in which the Minister recovered his balance, Mr. Hunt, after you moved the Committee with such speed and efficiency that not only mere Back Benchers were caught out, but experienced Ministers could not keep up with its progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a strategy behind what is going on. The Government decided to get control of local authorities' housing investment programme by reducing that programme and expecting individual projects to be referred to the Department of the Environment before money could be spent on them, but that was not good enough for them. They now want to control the Housing Revenue Account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the amendment to a Division now because we shall return to the issue. The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), in an illuminating comment, spoke on behalf of freedom — he said "free action". It is amazing that the language of freedom of choice and free action so often used by the Tory party is now proving to be the language of complete control. We shall keep the spotlight on this topic. The show will run a little longer before it peters out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's response was not the most generous, but I hope that my arguments will grow on him. It was a probing amendment to which we shall return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly—[hon. Members: "Hear, Hear."] The amendments relate to the consequences of surpluses at the end of the current financial year which may exist in Housing Revenue Accounts as dealt with in schedule 4. They probe the reasoning behind the limit and its justifiication. There is a principle underlying the amendment and technical matters which need clarification. The principle is simple. We believe that surpluses generated by tenants in the past should not be passed to poll tax payers to reduce their costs unless an authority so decides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>899</span>
We are mystified as to how the £5 million limit, which works out at £150 a dwelling, should be so imposed. Amendment No. 492 seeks to find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 493 deals with the consequences of that limit to larger authorities—specifically those with £33,000 or over. Amendment No. 442 relates to surpluses earmarked for maintenance which may be left over. I shall question the Minister on that matter. Why is there to be a change in the law? Will authorities be under any compulsion to transfer part of their repair account surpluses to the poll tax account? If so, the money should be kept in the housing account where it is most needed. I wait with bated breath for the Minister's reply, which I hope will be equally concise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be equally brief. The hon. Gentleman suggested what was originally proposed and he was right. The consultation paper proposed that the new Housing Revenue Account should start in April 1990 with a nil balance. Thus, the improved disciplines would have had an immediate effect. After further consideration—we listened, as we customarily do, and treated the representations fairly—we decided instead to allow a reasonable level of balances. Authorities generally carry a working balance on the account for genuine reasons and we would not wish to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose that local authorities should be able to carry forward a maximum balance of £150 per dwelling in the Housing Revenue Account, subject to a ceiling of £5 million. Amendment No. 492, to which the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) spoke, would remove the £5 million ceiling. I understand, now that the hon. Gentleman has explained it to the Committee, why he proposed that. He asked how we arrived at those figures. We considered that they were reasonable and unobjectionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £150 dwelling cut-off was suggested by the Association of District Councils and it seemed a fair figure to take. The £5 million ceiling would come into play for about 20 of the larger authorities, of which only two held a balance of more than that amount in 1987–88. Together, those provisions should be sufficient for all genuine purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 523 is a technical amendment relating to the calculation of the general cut-off point. The Bill, as drafted, would require calculation of the limit by reference to houses in the Housing Revenue Account in the financial year 1989–90.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 66 allows authorities which wish to do so to continue a housing repairs account. If they choose to exercise that discretion, all income and expenditure relating to the maintenance of Housing Revenue Account property must be debited or credited to the repairs account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 442 would remove that provision. The effect would be to give authorities a loophole through which they could evade the limit on Housing Revenue Account balances. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment. The provision is clearly part of the Bill's overall strategy and it would serve no purpose to isolate this one aspect. However, our principled objection has not been answered. I understand the techical answers, although I do not fully
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>900</span>
accept them. No doubt at the appropriate stage we shall have more to say on the matter, by not tonight.

	<p>	<i>'Credit Balance where Authority has no outstanding Debt.</i></p>
	<p>2A. A local housing authority which has no outstanding Housing Revenue Account debt may carry the whole or part of any credit balance, arising from interest from capital receipts, shown in their Housing Revenue Account for that year to the credit of some other revenue account of theirs.'.</p>
	<p>I move the amendment on behalf of the London Boroughs Association which is run, of course, by our political friends. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will pay some heed to what it has said.</p>
	<p>Many local authorities will be able completely to pay off their Housing Revenue Account debt. The amendment would enable such authorities to transfer the benefit of the receipts set aside for redemption—the interest on the receipts—to the authority's general fund for the benefit of community charge payers as a whole.</p>
	<p>That process will further encourage authorities to sell their council housing. We should welcome that and as the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) often claims to be the father of the policy of selling council houses, no doubt he, too, will welcome it. As I said, it will encourage authorities to sell their council housing to raise sufficient capital receipts to repay their Housing Revenue Account debt and to enable surplus receipts, after all the debt has been repaid, to be used for the benefit of community charge payers.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely wish to say how hurt I am that the London Boroughs Association has found another lover.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it get the same treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps not. As always my hon. Friend's argument is compelling, but I must ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our calculation of each authority's entitlement to Housing Revenue Account subsidy will take into account, among other things, the full amount of interest earned on unspent capital receipts which is credited to the account. That will include the interest on capital receipts which are set aside to reduce net indebtedness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I covered much of that ground in my response to earlier amendments, but my hon. Friend's amendment would go further than anything that we discussed this morning. It would provide that an authority whose net indebtedness in respect of the Housing Revenue Account is zero or less than zero should be allowed to transfer the interest on all its surplus receipts including those required to be set aside. That could be a transfer out of the Housing Revenue Account across the ring fence to some other revenue account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that the purpose I outlined in moving the amendment that local authority community charge payers should have the benefit of interest on capital receipts is already included in the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the new provisions in the housing finance part of the Bill, capital receipts drawn down will still be an incentive, as my hon. Friend will recall from our earlier debate on the way in which capital receipts should be treated. The interest from the 25 per cent. of capital receipts which is allowed to be transferred can be transferred right across to the part of the equation that includes management and maintenance, debt redemption or repayment of borrowing. There continues to be an incentive for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand what the London Boroughs Association said on this matter, it should continue to be encouraged to draw in as many capital receipts as it possibly can. I do not think that it has yet taken fully on board what we are trying to do. There is a calculation to benefit that side of the equation, which the London Boroughs Association should welcome. I accept that at this stage the London Boroughs Association is not prepared to move very much, but nor am I. Perhaps we can return to the issue on later clauses, but I am not prepared to meet my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is also on behalf of the friends of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick), the Master Cutler, and myself who run the London Boroughs Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Government first introduced the right to buy in 1980, many local authorities have actively pursued the Government's policy of council house sales. That has contributed to it being one of the most successful Government policies in the 1980s. Now, the Government seek to penalise many of those authorities which have contributed to that success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities which have used the interest from sales receipts to reduce net rate fund expenditure in accordance with Government policy will be penalised with an immediate loss of revenue subsidy equivalent to the average contributions which the rate fund received in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>902</span>
years 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89. The amendment seeks to remove that penalty by not allowing the Secretary of State to reduce rent rebate subsidy for contributions made from the Housing Revenue Account to the general rate fund under the previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One illustration is that local authorities which have subsidised rents will gain and those following Government policy will lose from day one. My understanding is that the London Borough of Bromley, for example, will lose £2.5 million from day one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend the Minister answer a specific question about shared ownership housing? The Government should encourage shared ownership sponsored by local authorities. There is no political difference in that we welcome shared ownership. If a borough does a do-it-yourself shared ownership scheme, the local authority spend the money which eventually comes back as capital receipts. Under this measure, only 25 per cent. of those capital receipts can be used again. Surely that is the death knell of local authority sponsored shared ownership schemes and not what we want to see?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West that this is purely a transitional issue. It does not mean that authorities which make RSCs are being treated more generously under the new system than those which ran the Housing Revenue Account without ratepayers' money. The new subsidy system will put more pressure on authorities that have kept rents low in that way. We cannot allow a sudden increase in the burden on tenants, nor should we pay a subsidy unnecessarily where the Housing Revenue Account balances without it. I hope that in those circumstances, and given that assurance, my hon. Friend will feel disposed to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend elaborate on his last point about shared ownership?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on how a local authority is running the scheme. Some authorities contribute to housing associations that are in partnership with them. We are not against shared ownership schemes in principle, but they would have to comply with the new financial stringency that is enshrined in this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having visited a number of local authorities that have become involved in such schemes, I know that they are concerned about the provisions that are set out in the Bill. If they wish to embark upon shared ownership schemes—as I have said, we do not oppose them—their efficiency should be examined in the same way as the other components within the Housing Revenue Account ring fence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed by my hon. Friend's answer, which does not relate directly to the point about shared ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend did not mean to say what he said. What I said does relate to shared ownership. If anything comes out of the ring fence—I have explained in some detail how ring fencing would work — and if a local authority wishes to become involved in shared ownership, it is clear that there must be a direct line between that and what it has chosen to spend the money on, and it must be made clear to ratepayers and taxpayers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>903</span>
that it can be justified by that local authority as an efficient spend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. My concern is different. I think that shared ownership is extremely important, particularly in outer London. There are people who, with the incomes of the 1970s, could buy their own home who cannot do so now. This provision cuts off one area of shared ownership schemes.

I understand what my hon. Friend the Minister says, but the fact is that spending will be reduced on what are reasonable and good schemes. That is especially so at a time when, as I understand it, the Housing Corporation is closing down its do-it-yourself schemes. I am greatly concerned. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would consider again whether something could be done to protect the schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 524, in

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 496, in
	<br><blockquote><p>page 133, line 32, leave out 'or likely state'.</p></blockquote>
Part IV of the schedule requires local authority officers to supply information about the Housing Revenue Account. The amendment would remove the need for officers to make guesses about the future state of the account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister a few straightforward questions. First, how can he justify putting an onerous legal responsibility upon officers to make guesses about what the Housing Revenue Account might be like at a future unspecified date?. Secondly, how far into the future will an officer have to look, and what will be the penalty if he gets its wrong? Finally, where is the precedent in legislation for an officer to make guesses of this nature? If Labour Government were to apply this sort of stricture to a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>904</span>
Chancellor of the Exchequer for his estimates last year of the inflation rate and the size of the balance of payments deficit, he would have a large fine slapped on him or be subjected to some other, unspecified penalty. I should be in favour of that. Unless the Minister can assure me that the strictures would apply equally to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I should like him to answer my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, we have not taken time out to think of a punishment that could be imposed on a local government officer who got it wrong. As the hon. Gentleman proposes that the same thing should happen to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for example, it is unlikely that we should think of a punishment. We shall return to the matter in future.

The situation that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) described exists already under various Acts, particularly the Housing Act 1985. There is no difference in the wording. The only reason for the inclusion of the three words was to make it clear that the power relates to current, future and past years. I emphasise that the power is already used to refer to the present and the future, as well as to the past. We envisage no change in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
