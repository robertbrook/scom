<p>"(1) The Secretary of State shall, after consultation with the local authority associations and such other bodies as he considers appropriate, make regulations for the purpose of establishing a comprehensive system of remuneration for councillors elected to membership of a local authority, which takes account of the size and functions of such an authority.</p>

<p><i>Question proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>], That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned earlier today, I was developing the theme of the necessity to improve the calibre of the local council representative. I make no apology for speaking on a subject about which I have felt strongly from the moment when I entered local government more than 25 years ago, in 1960, and I know other Conservative Members who share the same general feeling that I have about it.<br><br>
I remember my introduction to politics as a young boy, after the war, when my father became a member of the then Salford city council—he remained a member until 1968. I recall listening to the late Labour Member of Parliament for the constituency that was then called Salford, North. He visited my home regularly, and he was also an alderman of the council. As a young boy, I used to listen to them discussing local and national politics, and my interest in politics developed from that.<br><br>
However, as politicians, we make a mistake in assuming that the wider public are as interested in the world of politics as we are. One has only to ask people, "Can you name your local councillor?" to realise how few can do so. If one takes the exercise further and asks, "Can you name your Member of Parliament?" it can be a salutary exercise.<br><br>
In an intervention in the Minister's speech, I said that one of the fundamental weaknesses of local government is that no one is trained in local government procedure before becoming a member. It is rather like when one first becomes a Member of Parliament, or one's first day at school: one sinks or swims; one asks the way around.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, whose speech is fascinating, but it has little relevance to the remuneration of councillors. I ask him to confine his remarks to the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Hunt, but I am attempting to relate my comments to the calibre of the local government representative and, through that, to the necessity, not the option, of placing politics, especially local government politics, on a respectable and responsible level, and of rewarding the job for what it is worth. If a job is worth doing, it is worth paying the proper rate.<br><br>
The Minister said that he was not in favour of payment in the form of wages for local councillors, but that he was in favour of contributions towards expenses. With great respect to the Minister and his colleagues, those self-same arguments were used 100 years ago in response to the question about whether Members of Parliament should be paid, and local government has not moved on in those 100 years.<br><br>
The budgets of many local authorities are in excess of those of many small countries with the right to sit in the United Nations assembly—for example, Malta and some of the Pacific islands. Some of the major local authorities have larger budgets than certain Departments of the House, which warrants a more sophisticated approach to how we recruit and remunerate our local representatives.<br><br>
Opposition Members try to suggest that there has not been a proliferation of meetings for which there is no justification, but in my experience that is a growing trend, which is greatly to be deplored. Opposition Members also try to deny the increasing interference by local councillors in executive functions and in the day-to-day running of councils, and the Minister's remarks were correct. Councillors should formulate policies, give instructions, leave officers to carry out those policies and bring them to book if they do not.<br><br>
Interference in the civil service of local government is part and parcel of the philosophy of the far Left and reflects such local councillors' lack of experience and training. They cannot differentiate between the policy function and the executive function. Unless we can recruit the right calibre of person to local government, we shall have one local government Act after another, year in, year out, irrespective of the party in Government. We must tackle the root weakness of local government—the fact that the calibre of those who administrate locally is deteriorating rather than improving.<br><br>
A year or so ago a Labour councillor with Cumbria county council was the Labour party candidate against me at the general election. He lost his job in the local shipyards because his responsibilities on Cumbria county council involved him being chairman of the Lake district special planning board and he did not put in the hours at work that his employers wanted. I appreciate the problems for both the employers and the individual. At about the same time the then Labour leader of Barrow district council lost his job in similar circumstances, as have Conservatives involved in local government.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
Over the years I have seen councillors from all parties make tremendous sacrifices because of their involvement in local politics. I know of local business men who became hooked on politics and neglected their firms to get into the town hall, with the result that they went bankrupt, their families suffered and their marriages broke up. I have seen other councillors forgo promotion. The choice was theirs, but they could not give all their time to their job because they wished to be involved in local government.<br><br>
It is wrong in principle that people should have to make such choices. If local government and local politics are worth while and something that we wish to encourage, we must pay fair and proper remuneration. Otherwise we must turn the clock back 150 years and regard local government as parish pump politics that people can pursue in their spare time as a hobby.<br><br>
Members of Parliament are privileged to be paid to do what was a hobby before we were elected. If we accept the principle that Members of Parliament are entitled to be paid—whether it is the correct rate for the job is an interesting argument for another occasion—the same should apply to councillors in local politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I concur with my hon. Friend's comments about the sacrifice that many people make to be involved in local government.<br><br>
New clause 2 refers to levels of remuneration. Will the payment that my hon. Friend envisages be such that people will need no other remuneration? How will he pitch that payment in view of the variety of people, from the well-off to the unemployed, who take part in local government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People involved in local or national politics must be very rich or very poor. Those in the middle cannot afford to be involved. What may be a pittance to one individual may be a fortune to another. I trust that my hon. Friend will excuse me if I do not give a figure. The principle is important. The figure is a matter of opinion. The new clause makes it subject to the Secretary of State's concurrence.<br><br>
Reference has been made to the problems of officers. I have worked with many officers in local government over many years and I could count on one hand and have fingers to spare those whom I would employ in a private capacity. The reason for that is that no self-respecting officer would put up with the nonsensical way in which local government is administered. There is a proliferation of committees and increasing interference in executive functions from elected members.<br><br>
I have friends who are local government officers but, with honourable exceptions, I regard the officers in local government as professional rejects from the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit strong.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that that is a bit strong. His comments are moderate; I have heard far worse remarks than what I have said.<br><br>
Side by side with the deterioration in the calibre of the local councillor is the deterioration in the calibre of the professional officer. I am not surprised that this Government and Labour Administrations have run into difficulties.<br><br>
I have said sufficient for hon. Members to be crystal clear about where I stand on the principle of the issue. If, tomorrow morning, we went as shareholders to the annual general meeting of a big public company and found that the board of directors was conducting its affairs as they conducted in the House or in local government, we would sack those people on the spot. But we tolerate our political system because we who are involved become "establishmentised".<br><br>
The reform of our political system in national and local government is long overdue. But the prerequisite is to make national and local politics an honourable profession, which its practitioners can be proud of and which the public can respect.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I should like to give a few examples from my 12 years' experience as a member, and later as a leader, of a local authority.<br><br>
Most councillors would prefer a salary or remuneration rather than an allowance. We have listened to the pros and cons, but no one has said that claiming allowances is open to abuse. Unfortunately, many councillors abuse the system. If remuneration were paid, there would be no abuse.<br><br>
I found it embarrassing to claim my attendance allowance. I felt that it was wrong, even though it was legal, as some councillors did not claim. It would be better if local councillors were not subjected to that embarrassment. It was made worse because many unscrupulous people, who did not understand the workings of local government, got lists of claims from the treasurer's department and published them in the newspapers. Although the claims were justified, it looked as though councillors were greedy in claiming allowances.<br><br>
In Durham it was ironic that councillors who did not claim were sometimes beaten at elections. Although that had nothing to do with submitting claims, that was strange.<br><br>
As councillors become more senior in local government they attend more meetings and consequently claim more allowances. For me, that became increasingly embarrassing. As a "back bencher" I attended only a few meetings, but as I became more senior I became a member of more committees and claimed more allowances. From what the Minister said this morning I got the impression that he thought meetings were set up so that councillors could attend and claim an allowance for doing so. I objected to attending so many meetings. For 10 years I did not see my family grow up. I have two kids, but sometimes I could not even remember their names because I had been away from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
home for so long. I worked during the day and went to council meetings at 4 o'clock. Often I did not return home until 9 o'clock—that happened almost every night of the week. I did it because I loved it, not because I wanted to attend as many meetings as possible so that I could claim as much as possible. I felt that the Minister was accusing councillors of doing that.<br><br>
In my local authority we declined the special responsibility allowances because we felt that by accepting them we should be criticised by the electorate of feathering our nests. We were daft, because we were entitled to those allowances, but we did not take them because we feared what the public might think.<br><br>
Many of my colleagues, particularly those who worked in the collieries, had to chose between tenants' allowances, financial loss allowances and goodness knows what else. It is not right that some people should be out of pocket because they want to serve and do good for their community. A salary would prevent that. Members found that their benefits were affected. They did not know whether they could claim. It is silly that they should have those worries on top of trying to represent their electorate. Ours must be the only country in western Europe to allow that.<br><br>
I know a man who was active in the Labour party and when he was invalided out of the colliery, we asked him whether he would stand at the local elections. He refused because he was frightened that he might lose his benefits, or that there would be problems with income tax and the Department of Social Security. Although he was quite capable, willing and would have made an excellent candidate, he was restricted because of the fear that he might lose the money that would help to support his family. In a democracy it is not right to take away as the Bill does, the rights of many people to participate in local government because they are worried about their pension or benefit rights. That is appalling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has reminded me of one of my constituents who is on disability benefit. She was advised wrongly by the Department of Social Security that she might lose that benefit and so resigned from the council. That illustrates how worried people are about the possible effect of their local government service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinbert</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. When members asked me to speak to the chief executive or treasurer on their behalf, I found that the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security did not know the rules and were giving wrong information—one was giving certain information, but the other gave different information. Members just did not know where they were. Some resigned and others did not bother to stand for election.<br><br>
It would be sensible to get rid of those anomalies and introduce some form of remuneration. This morning I got the impression that the Minister was saying that members created meetings so that they could bump up their attendance allowances. That is silly. As I tried to explain, there is a maximum that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
can be claimed on one day. If a meeting of my council, for example, lasted for more than four hours, a member who attended could claim £18.25. If meetings lasted for more than nine hours in one day, which often happened, members could still claim £18.25 only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. A council of 48 members would not be regarded as large—it would probably be average size. Nevertheless, comparatively few of that number would normally attend more than two committee meetings a week. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government made the point that some councillors—perhaps even in Durham in the past and certainly in the local authority of which I was a member—organised events so that they attended meetings on a daily basis. That perhaps does not sound a lot, but many chief officers have said to me and to my right hon. Friend, quietly and outside the hearing of elected representatives, that they are relieved that we shall be dealing with that. They are worried about the proliferation of meetings that they must attend, which does not allow them to get on with the job that they are supposed to be doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The members who attend most meetings are often the leaders of the council, who would be dealing with council business on virtually a full-time basis. It is right that back-bench members would not attend as many meetings, but they would not be on all the committees that were set up to deal with, for example, the 50 Acts relating to local government that the Government have introduced during the past 10 years. It was extremely difficult to keep up with that legislation and attend the meetings. If the officers did not like it, they had to lump it becuase they were on a hell of a salary. In fact the majority of chief officers employed by Durham city council earn more money than I do as a member of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the situation in Durham similar to that in Haringey where councillors do not claim for certain meetings, such as party meetings and meetings of the majority group? The number of unpaid meetings has increased because of the 50 local government Acts introduced by the Minister and his right hon. and hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt about that. My hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) is right, but the Minister is not the only one responsible. In the past 12 years there have been 50 local government Acts, which have increased the workload of not only local councillors but officers. Councillors must now attend more meetings to be briefed on the Acts. Local authorities will have to be briefed on this measure, which will take time to digest.<br><br>
In most cases, local authority members are dedicated people who do not aim to make a profit from local government but who want to serve the public. They are interested in politics and feel that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
they have something to offer. The problems of claiming attendance allowances should be removed. Remuneration should be based on the size of the authority and the number and workload of members. That would make local government respectable and would cut out the fiddling, which undoubtedly occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg), my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) and, although it is the kiss of death for him, with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). I have had lengthy discussions with him about the payment, times and duties of councillors.<br><br>
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister that the £18.25 does not go into the councillor's pocket, but is subject to taxation and national insurance at source. A councillor must go through the humiliating process of trying to claim back expenses of office from the Inland Revenue under the Local Government Act 1972. He is made to jump through a hoop backwards and sidewards for about £300, which covers the cost of heating for one room, the use of a room as an office, telephone calls, postage and that which is not reimbursed by the council. However, it does not cover the meals to which the hon. member for Brightside and myself have never sat down because we were shooting from one political meeting to another, not as council representatives but because of the office that we held.<br><br>
I have missed many meals because of my involvement in the political scene. I once tried to eat a sandwich in the shower. My young daughter said, "Daddy, where are you going?" I told her that I was going to a meeting. She asked what a meeting was so I told her that it meant sitting round a table and talking at the town hall. She thought that they should be held in people's homes so that at least one person would not have to rush like I did. From the mouths of babes and sucklings come words of wisdom. That is what some of us in local government have endured. We have missed bonfire nights and wedding anniversaries. I always used to miss my wife's birthday because, no matter how hard I tried, there would always be a council meeting.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I can see the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks). He referred to me saying that it was a slur on councillors. It is not a slur on councillors. It is a matter of the calibre of councillors that we get. Self-employed people have similar difficulties to employees. They have other problems, too. As my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness said, business is lost because, if one is not there, someone else will take one's place. I do not know what form of remuneration would be appropriate, but I think that councillors should receive expenses.<br><br>
It is nonsense to jump through the hoop backwards for the Inland Revenue for £300 and then to receive letters asking how one knows one has spent so much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
on postage. If one wrote to the chief executive of the local authority, one would have a stamped and addressed envelope. If one wrote to a constituent, one would put a stamp on the envelope and make a record of that and submit it. I accept what the hon. Member for City of Durham said about making sure that when the lists were published one's name was somewhere in the middle because the top name was overclaiming and the bottom name never attended. It was nonsensical.<br><br>
I do not object to these details being published. However, when the hon. Member for Brightside and I joined and when our expenses or attendance allowances for the year had been prepared, the headlines in the local paper would read, "Council leader gets £X", "Tory leader gets £Y". The latter figure was much smaller, so the implication was that I was not really doing my job. People would tell me that the council leader worked very hard but that I did not appear to do the same. The knockers used to say that the leader got a lot of money for just attending meetings and would ask me why I did not attend so many meetings. There is a dichotomy. The problem is not easily resolved.<br><br>
I listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness and to the hon. Member for City of Durham. Somewhere in between lies the solution. There should be expenses for filing. The Minister and I have a mutual friend who is leader of Bury. He brought in management consultants to set up a filing system. Eventually they told him that they had devised a system for him known as the "heap system" which is the one that he was already using. There were heaps here, there and everywhere. People in local government all have papers in their homes. They are vital until we look at them and wonder why we saved them. We need something for postage. We need something for telephone expenses. I did not get a responsibility allowance as leader of the opposition on South Yorkshire county council, and I was leader from the day that I joined until the day I locked the door and we closed it down. I never progressed. Despite the ups and downs of politics, I stayed there. I did not have typing facilities either. In the end I bought myself a word processor. When I told the Inland Revenue about it I was asked for an assurance that it was only used for council work.<br><br>
That is nonsense. It is utterly stupid that the Department of the Environment pays councillors and the Treasury takes the cash back. Somewhere in between lies a balance. One needs research. Using the heap system that I inherited from my friend, Bert Little, I have heaps of paper and I can never find anything because my wife insists periodically that they are moved. I can guarantee that the file that is moved contains the information that I need.<br><br>
My wife will kill me for saying this, but she was not very helpful as my research assistant when I was a councillor. For example, when I asked her for an article which had appeared in <i>The Star</i> three weeks earlier about the hon. Member for Brightside, who was then leader of the council, she said, "You told me that you did not want anything out of the paper, so I should throw it away." I then made matters worse by cutting items out of the newspaper before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0643">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
she had the opportunity to read it. It did not lead to a harmonious life.<br><br>
Councillors cannot claim for mileage which does not cover travel to and from council meetings. They claim the mileage allowance for going round the constituency and have to submit that figure to the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
I understand the argument that councillors should have a flat fee of X thousand pounds for doing the job. But that fee would be taxed at source and would be useless. It would be of no benefit. The fee would be grossed up if a councillor had another job. When I was a councillor, the hardest thing was keeping a job, and I know that other members of the council had the same problem. That is why I maintain that the councillor's family makes the sacrifice when it comes to evening meetings, not the company that employs him. It could be guaranteed that, eventually, a councillor who had a job became unemployed. When it was time for promotion, he did not get promoted.<br><br>
I do not accept that councillors should receive payment, but I accept that there could be a package of expenses. If they are to receive the £18.25, it should be on the same basis as the financial loss allowance.<br><br>
I do not want to see councillors on a salary of £X. However, they are entitled to expenses. When the Department of the Environment says that the attendance allowance has been upgraded by X, a figure for expenses should be similarly upgraded to take account of the facilities that the majority of councillors provide. It is a public service, but being a councillor is a full-time job. Councillors are like a board of directors which says, "This is our policy. It is up to the officers of council to execute it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak at length on this matter. Indeed, I had not intended to speak at all. But I should like to confirm and welcome what both Government and Opposition Members have said about the amount of effort and financial loss that many councillors incur and the pressure on them, both in meeting their expenses and holding down their jobs. The new clause gives us the opportunity to raise those matters. It is to be welcomed, if only because it has provided the opportunity for the first rebellion on Conservative Benches. Two Conservative Members have chided the Minister for his earlier comments on councillors.<br><br>
I do not believe that councillors are overpaid. In most cases, they are sadly under-compensated for their effort and work. If they had proper remuneration, it might be possible to tackle the abuses of the system, where councillors are elected but rarely turn up and put in just enough effort to keep their seats on the council. There might be greater control if councillors claimed a wage.<br><br>
I am concerned that Minister are moving towards the Widdicombe recommendation for a flat-rate system of support to meet costs. Given that being a councillor is not a full-time job and that there is no wage, we could end up compensating those who do not put in effort, involvement and time while penalising those who do. That would be a great pity, especially as, with the current inadequate support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
and compensation for councillors, the finances of many people who put in long hours and a lot of effort are already hit hard.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister's suggestion that many councillors who claim high levels of attendance are doing so to obtain that compensation is not true. They usually do so because their costs are high. For example, the chairman and vice-chairman of Carrick district council both serve ex officio on every committee. Because of the balance of different parties on that council, their attendance at committees is often very important, so although they may not meet evey week, they are in council regularly. No one can suggest that Carrick district council has seen a proliferation of semi-politicised committees—on the contrary, the number of committees has been cut since the last round of district council elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the debate that we have had today, and I am sorry that the Minister of State is not here to hear me say so. Apart from some ingrained prejudices, which were all subjective, there have been some useful contributions. For instance, I did not know that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) ferreted out the cuttings from the local newspaper in which I was mentioned. I shall treasure that thought for a long time. The fact that his wife threw them away showed a strenght of intellect on her part.<br><br>
If we are not to have a salaried local government system, we must find another way. As the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) said, the real dilemma is whether local government is to be run by the very rich and the very poor. There are ways round it: employers could have the option of being directly reimbursed: or we could get over some of the problems by having substantially different rates according to the size and functions of authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that to remunerate employers would severely disadvantage the self employed and therefore would not be a helpful avenue, given that that is a growing sector of the employed workforce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that would be a problem and that there would have to be some agreement on the calculations to be made. But it would not be impossible to do that. The self-employed will lose heavily under any system that has a basic level of remuneration. By all accounts, it will be very basic.<br><br>
We shall rely heavily on special responsibility allowances. That worries me, as it inevitably places a burden on the council in terms of that allocation of those resources. As we did not claim them when I was a councillor, I have an underlying puritanical feeling that they are not a good idea, but I am open to persuasion.<br><br>
I hope that this evening's debate will be taken on board, because hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have indicated genuine feelings.<br><br>
I should like to make a point about criticisms. Some elected members believe that the time that they spend in committees is commensurate with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
competence or effectiveness of their authorities, but they are wrong. Sitting in meetings is not a substitute for getting things done. However, elected members have often filled a vacuum that officers have left when they have not taken up the challenge of managerial responsibility. Local authority members are not simply interfering busy bodies who would really like to be managers. There is an element of that, and there was when the Bains report was published in 1972. The Bains report was far more scathing than the Widdicombe report in its criticism of those who went out to inspect every street light, tested the location of every bus stop, and became heavily involved in the allocation of housing, in the districts to which my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred this morning. Thank goodness those days have gone.<br><br>
Some elected members were keen to arrange meetings that coincided with lunch. Their numbers are dwindling, as the hon. Member for Hallam said in one of his more enlightened contributions. Most of us took a sandwich and did not turn up at functions to which we were invited because of our position. We could not attend, or we should not have been able to do our job properly. Those are past criticisms and have diminished considerably.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
There has been a realisation that members have a clear policy-making role and that management must take responsibility for taking decisions and be accountable for them. We need a system that allows elected memebers to monitor what managers are doing, so that they can be accountable to the electorate. We recognise that there is some irony in what was said this morning about councillors being directors of companies and not getting involved in management. If that is true, it applies to the chairmen of urban development corporations, residuary bodies and water authorities, all of whom have less onerous and diverse responsibilities than those who run large authorities.<br><br>
Councillors should be remunerated to compensate them for the time that they allocate and for the loss of their businesses, as those who give up part of their time to serve on UDCs are compensated. The Government were proud to announce last week how many of the chairmen of UDCs were active in business and enterprise. That is not a bad thing, if it is recognised that other people engaged in democratic activity should be treated and remunerated in the same way.<br><br>
I do not know whether the story that my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton told me is true—that on the platform of Wakefield station he met the Minister of State, who was going to visit Wakefield and Calderdale and who was also visiting his pig farm, which he declared to be somewhere in the vicinity. I am not sure whether that means that it was a very clean pig farm and he could not identify it by the smell, or whether he had not visited it very often in the past. However, I am sure that it was no discredit to Wakefield and Calderdale. The point is that he went during the day, and met the councillors
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
during the day. Presumably, they managed to get off work to meet him, and I am pleased that they did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Lunch?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea whether they had lunch—bacon, pork or anything else. I am sure that the councillors were glad to have the opportunity to meet the Minister and to discuss the important work that they were doing, and that they did not detain him too long from his duties.<br><br>
We differ from other European countries in important respects. Ireland does not have a developed system of local government and is suffering bcause of the EEC's funding arrangements and the preparations for 1992. Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does not have a sophisticated remuneration system for councillors to enable them to do their duties.<br><br>
If we are not to move towards a mayoral system on the lines of France and the United States, we must spread that burden and give those who take collective responsibility at senior level the chance to do that job effectively. Unless the Government respond, far from achieving the goal of stopping local councils being political and enabling those whom they dislike to be active, they will find that they have disabled the very people whom they sought to reinforce and help to do a decent job.<br><br>
I quote the solicitor and county secretary in Kent who, announcing his retirement, said that he was sad that he had to leave local government because of the political interference that was making his job difficult. The Conservative leader of Kent county council, Tony Hart, said that he wholeheartedly agreed with him. It was not the interference of elected members struggling to do their job, but the gross politicisation of the role of local councillors which resulted from the adversarial type of politics that has developed in local government. Widdicombe recognised, it, and so do those who are keen to do a job, want to do it well, and must work in partnership with elected members to do so.<br><br>
I hope that the debate has proved a useful and positive contribution to the work of the Committee, and also helped to ensure that the final outcome will be that some local councillors will remain to do the job in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to hesitate in making any contribution to the debate, in view of the fact that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) accused my right hon. Friend the Minister of State of making about 47 different interventions in this morning's debate. That was grossly unfair, as my right hon. Friend is anxious always to take up every point raised by Opposition Members, whether or not it is relevant to the amendment before them. Conservative Members on the Committee—perhaps all hon. Members—savour and welcome every contribution that my right hon. Friend makes.<br><br>
There have been a number of additional contributions this afternoon, and I shall reply briefly to some of them. I was interested in the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
Furness (Mr. Franks). He started by talking about the lack of training for councillors. I thought about that matter late last week when I was reading the brief for today's debate. Our view is that local authority responsibility for the training of councillors can be achieved by presentations to new councillors. I am not sure whether they were available in the city of Manchester, but they were in my local council. The presentations were made by senior officers, and I found them invaluable.<br><br>
The trouble is that a number of elected representatives—dare I say newly elected representatives—of whatever political party seem to resent any form of training offered in that way. It is stupid of them. Had some councillors attended those presentations in the early days of their council membership, they would have learnt a great deal. It is not true that Members of Parliament do not get such assistance. When I was a new Member of Parliament in 1979, presentations were made available to those of us who entered the House then, and we found them of great value. It is probably more accurate to talk of the lack of training of Ministers. I have always thought that the most suitable distance training course for them is the well-known weekly programme, "Yes Minister". I had been a Minister for three of four weeks, when my wife had to tell me that "Yes Minister" was a comedy. I thought that it was a documentary, it was so close to the bone.<br><br>
My argument about local authority representatives is that facilities can, and in many cases are, made available to new Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's remarks. I arrived here after a by-election, and I am intrigued by the seminars that he was offered. Nothing like that was on offer after a by-election. It might have been helpful if I had had the same information. The hon. Gentleman mentioned "Yes Minister", but I am afraid that future generations of young people hoping to get into the House may be watching "The New Statesman", and taking it as a lead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I offer the hon. Gentleman this comfort: a by-election is the finest training course that any prospective or sitting Member of Parliament could have. I have already told the hon. Gentleman that, when his hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Sir Cyril Smith) beat me so handsomely in 1972, I learnt more in three and a half weeks, even in terms of Tory party politics, than I have ever learnt in so short a time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are being regaled with personal reminiscences. May we now return to the remuneration of councillors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Your are right, Mr. Hunt. My excuse is that I was led along that path by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). Members of the Committee will hear me say more than once that we are trying desperately to find the right balance. I agree with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that the contributions to the debate have been constructive and some have been notable. I respect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
the idea that some people serving on local authorities would suffer as a result of the measure.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness certainly struck a chord with me when he said that self-employed people who are prepared to serve on local authorities could do untold damage to their businesses. I suffered from that in 1975; my business nearly went bust when I became the leader of Rochdale council, however short that period was.<br><br>
Because of my experience, one might think that I should be the keenest member of the Committee to increase substantially the sum available in allowances to local authorities. But I do not take that view. A person wishing to become an elected representative is a volunteer when he or she signs up. Such people know the rules and regulations before they become involved.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside may remember that, when we discussed the matter last week, I said that I was concerned that, since 1973, when allowances became more the order of the day, there had not been benefits to local government as a whole. Indeed, I could argue that the situation has deteriorated as a result. We are still seeking the balance which the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) sought. That is why we have decided to consult the local authority associations. We should not be so arrogant as to appear to know the answer already. I admit that there is a problem, and that a number of people make sacrifices in order to serve on local authorities. I do not want to see full-time professional councillors, and I do not think that the vast majority of Opposition Members do, either. But nor do I want to see people suffer unnecessarily because they are prepared to give that service which we all admire.<br><br>
I have given the Committee a commitment, which will be recorded in <i>Hansard</i> [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear,"] and we shall embark on genuine consultation. We shall start from the belief that a flat-rate allowance is a good idea but we shall consult none the less. I hope that, as a result of the consultation, we shall arrive at a formula that will be acceptable not to everybody but to the vast majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to tie my hon. Friend to an exact time scale, but will he tell us roughly how long he expects the consultations to last and when he will be able to report back to whatever is the appropriate parliamentary forum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that. There will be two stages. The first will be the consultation process, which will not take long and can take place in the near future. Then we shall seek to draft a clause to append to the Bill allowing the regulation to be made. That time scale will be short. The local authority associations know well where we stand on the matter; we have already received certain letters and I have no doubt that we shall receive more. We need to have meetings. It will be a matter of weeks rather than months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Convention of Scottish

Local Authorities will be included in the consultations and be fully consulted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that it will. Having given that additional assurance, I hope that the motion will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is leaning over backwards to persuade us, but the way to persuade us is to accept the new clause. We shall, therefore, press it to a Division.</span></p>

IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMISSIONERS FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 24, line 22, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2AA) It shall be the duty of the authority concerned to take the action specified in a further report issued under (2A) below, to remedy the injustice to the person aggrieved and to prevent similar injustice being caused in the future.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 174, in page 24, line 42, leave out from beginning to end of line 6 on page 26.<br><br>
No. 150, in page 25, line 13, leave out from beginning to end of line 4 on page 26 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"he shall inform the person aggrieved in writing and that person shall have the right to seek an order in the county court requiring that the authority take appropriate action to remedy the injustice reported by the Local Commissioner and to prevent similar injustice being caused in the future.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment and one which I hope will be considered seriously by the Committee. At present, when a case of maladministration leading to injustice is referred to the local commissioner, the ombudsman, the council's response is purely voluntary. The amendment would impose a statutory duty on local authorities in England and Wales to provide the remedy stipulated by the local ombudsman, and if they failed to do so, it would be open to any party affected to go to court to enforce the duty.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
There is a difference between what is proposed in the amendment and what now happens in Northern Ireland, so it is different from amendment No. 150. It does not attempt merely to reflect the present situation in Northern Ireland—although that is closer to what I propose than to what happens in England, Wales and Scotland—but it places an onus on the authority to fulfil its duty, rather than on the complainant to seek satisfaction through the courts.<br><br>
The amendment proposes a fundamentally simpler system, but it would have the same effect of guaranteeing a remedy in cases of maladministration and injustice. It would remove the necessity for the cumbersome proposals in clause 18, which are an attempt by the Government to increase pressure on local authorities to implement the local ombudsman's recommendations voluntarily, and does much to clear up some of the technicalities that we may otherwise need to debate later.<br><br>
The amendment allows debate on the principle and signals the way in which changes should be made. Consequential amendments would be needed if the amendment is accepted to apply it to Scotland and supporting consequential amendments would be needed elsewhere in the Bill. However, that is no reason to dismiss my arguments. The amendment is not intended to complicate the debate.<br><br>
The most significant difference between the legislation that applies in Northern Ireland and that in England, Wales and Scotland relates to the power to enforce the recommendations of the local ombudsman. In Northern Ireland there is legal provision for complainants to apply to the county court for an award of damages when an authority has failed to provide a remedy in line with the recommendations. No such provision exists in the rest of the United Kingdom. I advised constituents to go to the local ombudsman who has made recommendations which the local council may not accept. The case has not gone far, but it is distressing for my constituents. If the local authority refuses to accept the recommendations there is nothing that they can do, other than to kick up a fuss and get some publicity. My constituents face serious financial consequences, including the loss of their home.<br><br>
The Local Government Act 1974 provides that when the local ombudsman concludes that maladministration has led to injustice to a complainant, a report is produced setting it out and an appropriate remedy is suggested. If the authority fails to take action, a further report is published which specifies a precise remedy for the complainant. If the authority still fails to provide a remedy, the local ombudsman is helpless to enforce the recommendations.<br><br>
In the first 12 years—to March 1986—of the existence of the Commission for Local Administration in England, 140 further reports were issued and in only 38 cases was there a satisfactory outcome. That is a failure rate of 73 per cent. In about 6.5 per cent. of cases in which both maladministration and injustice were found, no satisfactory remedy was provided. The figure of 6.5 per cent. may not sound high, but it is significant to my constituents who have lost their home, partly as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
a result of what has happened. Even more worrying is the fact that 19 per cent. of local authorities in England—a total of 68—failed to provide a remedy even in the face of a further report. The problem of local authorities not accepting the recommendations of the local ombudsman is extensive, although it does not happen in every case.<br><br>
In January 1985, faced with the possibility of legislation to allow enforcement of the local ombudsman's decisions, local authority associations urged member authorities to supply the remedies recommended even when they disagreed with them. But since then there has been no marked improvement in compliance. The result has been continued disappointment and disillusionment for individual complainants who have not received the remedies that they deserve and a growing danger that the system will be discredited.<br><br>
Many bodies with an interest in the ombudsman system have commented on enforcement, including most significantly, the ombudsmen themselves. In the 1984 review of the Local Government Act 1974, the Commission for Local Administration in England called on the relevant Secretary of State:
<br><blockquote><p>"to urge all authorities always to provide prompt and positive remedies when injustice is found by a Local Ombudsman".</p></blockquote>
It said that
<br><blockquote><p>"they should introduce legislation for the enforcement of remedies if a marked improvement is not made voluntarily in reasonable time".</p></blockquote>
It commended the Northern Ireland model, but there has been no improvement. The Committee should draw the same conclusion as the Commission for Local Administration in England, that local authorities should act on its recommendations.<br><br>
In his annual report for the same year, the ombudsman for Scotland concluded that statutory provision for enforcement had become necessary and added
<br><blockquote><p>"My predecessors and I have been very reluctant to come to this conclusion, feeling that it was much better to retain the voluntary system as long as failure to comply were a rarity, but the time has now come to say that the voluntary system is not working adequately."</p></blockquote>
The Welsh local ombudsman wrote in evidence to the Widdicombe committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"it is intolerable that any injustice caused by maladministration identified in the course of an objective and impartial investigation should be allowed to go unremedied."</p></blockquote>
The Widdicombe committee took up his view by recommending that
<br><blockquote><p>"there should be a new statutory right for complainants to apply to the county or sheriff court for a remedy in cases where the local ombudsman has found maladministration leading to injustice and the complainant is dissatisfied with by the remedy offered by the local authority."</p></blockquote>
Widdicombe recommended that the right should be based on the system in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The third report of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration published in June 1986 reached a similar conclusion. The Committee took evidence from local ombudsmen, the PCA, local authority representatives and from Ministers and concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"we consider that the best method of providing support for local ombudsmen's reports would be for our remit to be extended to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
allow the possibility of our calling recalcitrant local authorities to account. If experience showed that our involvement did not, however, have an improving effect on the treatment of the reports of local ombudsmen we would recommend serious consideration of the involvement of the courts along the lines recommended by Justice, supported by local ombudsmen and successfully operated in Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
The Justice recommendation referred to in the Select Committee report was made following a study in 1980 of the first five years of operation of the ombudsmen system. In a book published in 1988, Justice concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"enforcement through the courts does offer the best solution to what has become a major problem."</p></blockquote>
Justice recommended the following conditions precedent on the application to the court:
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) a report containing a finding in favour of the person aggrieved that he had suffered injustice in consequence of maladministration;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) a further report (following on the authority's failure or refusal to implement the first report) containing a recommendation as to the action which would be appropriate for the authority to take to remedy or compensate for the injustice;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) a certificate from the Local Ombudsman issued to the complainant to the effect that the local authority had had a reasonable time within which to comply with his further report and that no action to his satisfaction had been taken by the local authority, and further certifying that the case was, in his opinion, an appropriate one for application to the court for relief."</p></blockquote>
I think that I am showing the broad uniformity of views on the case. A solution is not only necessary but is now shown to be necessary.<br><br>
In response to a 1984 review of the Local Government Act 1974 the Government said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shares the Commission's concern that citizens found to have suffered an injustice should sometimes fail to secure the appropriate remedy. Although it occurs on relatively few occasions such an outcome compounds the original injustice to the individual and the resultant publicity may undermine public confidence both in the Commission and in local government as a whole."</p></blockquote>
At that time the Government promised to watch with close interest attempts by local authority associations to secure greater compliance with local authority rulings.<br><br>
I regret that in the 1988 White Paper on the Widdicombe report the Government did not come through with the conclusions that I should like. However, they said that non-compliance with local ombudsman reports, which they put at about 5 per cent., served
<br><blockquote><p>"to produce a particularly marked sense of grievance on the part of complainants, as well as undermining the credibility of the Local Ombudsman system as a whole."</p></blockquote>
The Minister will no doubt reply that the Government rejected the recommendation for enforcement through the courts on the grounds that
<br><blockquote><p>"If there was a possibility that a local Ombudsman report could subsequently be used as a basis for a court order, local authorities might be less willing to co-operate, and investigations would become increasingly formalised, lengthy, legalistic and costly. Complainants might find the process more intimidating and flexibility would be lost."</p></blockquote>
Instead of enforcement through the courts the Government propose the system that I mentioned to persuade local authorities through adverse publicity. Clauses 18 and 19 contain the proposals in legislative form. My fundamental objection to them is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
they will not work. Moreover, they are unnecessarily complicated. If the Minister looks back at all the recommendations, many of which I have mentioned, I am sure that he will reconsider his position. After all, the Government have accepted the primary arguments in favour of enforcement. Failure to comply compounds injustice for individuals; that is the view that people in my area take. It discredits the system.<br><br>
A National Opinion Poll survey on how people felt about the local ombudsman system showed that he was not regarded as especially effective. Only 8 per cent. said thay they would take their case to the ombudsman and only 3 per cent. regarded local ombudsmen as effective. That poll was done on behalf of the Widdicombe committee.<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
The Bill leaves individuals with no redress and allows local authorities to continue maladministration with impunity. So, having accepted the arguments for taking effective steps, the Government have proposed measures that do no more than beef up the present system, which has been shown to fail. They have done that against a chorus of opinion pressing for enforcement through the courts. I see no evidence to suggest that the Government's proposal will be effective. I would rather not have to wait for another Bill—No. 51, 52 or whatever it might be—to sort out that mistake. We shall know that the Government have got it wrong because an increasing number of people will find that their cases have not been satisfactorily sorted out as local authorities refuse to bow to the local ombudsman's wishes.<br><br>
Experience in Northern Ireland shows that enforcement has been successful. In about 1 per cent. of cases in which reports are issued, successful complainants make applications to the courts. According to the 1988 Justice—All Souls review, the Northern Ireland ombusdman
<br><blockquote><p>"believes that it is a significant advantage to him to know from the outset that at the end of the road there exists a possibility of court enforcement proceedings to back his recommendations."</p></blockquote>
In evidence to the parliamentary Select Committee he was
<br><blockquote><p>"quite clear that the prospect of a Court enforcement of one of the Commissioner's reports was of 'real significance' in securing compliance with the findings contained in it."</p></blockquote>
By contrast, the other local ombudsmen in their evidence to the Select Committee
<br><blockquote><p>"expressed concern at the harm done to the effectiveness of their office as a result of the failure rate."</p></blockquote>
The Scottish local ombudsman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Constantly in contacts with individuals, organisations and media we are faced with the statement that it is hardly worth going to the Ombudsman because he does not possess any powers."</p></blockquote>
The Welsh local ombudsman said that publicity about
<br><blockquote><p>"What is now regarded as a fundamental weakness in the role of the local ombusdman… undoubtedly affected the Commission's credibility."</p></blockquote>
Further adverse publicity against recalcitrant local authorities is likely to achieve little. They have shown
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
that in some circumstances they are prepared to ignore what, in some cases, has been bad publicity for them. They have ignored what an independent figure, after a great deal of research, has said was clear malpractice despite the considerable cost to the individual and to his faith in the system. Councils have been happy to put up with whatever flak has come their way.<br><br>
An effective system of enforcement is essential for the maintenance of public confidence in the local ombudsman system and for the strengthening of public expectations of fair treatment by local authorities. By creating a statutory duty for local authorities, the amendment would guarantee a remedy. Court action would be rarely necessary. That is the only point at which I depart from the amendment.<br><br>
I should like a simpler, easier system that places the onus on local authorities to act. In almost all cases, no action would be necessary but local authorities would know that the power was there if necessary. If the local authority had a case that it could argue in court, the court could make the final decision.<br><br>
I hope that all hon. Members will support the amendment because I know that they have experience of the important role of the ombudsman. I hope that the Minister will accept the intention of the amendment and, preferably, the amendment itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the thrust, if not the conclusion, of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) and seek an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister. If a local government ombudsman finds a local authority guilty of maladministration and the local authority wants to put right the matter but is obstructed by the Department of Environment, I want to be assured that in future the Department of the Environment will not stop the ombudsman's recommendations being implemented.<br><br>
I raised the case of one of my constituents, Mr. Farrar, during an Adjournment debate in 1977. I said then:
<br><blockquote><p>"Caught between the long arm of local government and the torso of central government, my constituent finds himself right in the armpit."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 7 April 1977, Vol. 929, c. 1502.]</p></blockquote>
The local government commissioner found the London borough of Ealing guilty of maladministration. Ealing admitted its guilt. They went to the Department of the Environment to ask for the powers to make the necessary payment, but it refused. That made a mockery of the whole system. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to assure us that in future her Department will not do what it did then—under the control of a Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said and I do not wish to repeat it. Amendment No. 150 would give the right to go to a county court to remedy an injustice. If the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) were to accept that amendment, he would resolve his

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
problem because in those circumstances the court could make an order and the Department of the Environment would not be able to stand in the way.<br><br>
Local authorities are not only very good on the whole, but have councillors elected to ensure that people can have their grievances dealt with. That works in the vast majority of cases. We support the ombudsman system, which is essentially a backstop against things going wrong. It is a pity that there is not a similar system for the private sector. If a Member for Parliament, or a councillor, receives a complaint from a constituent about a large private sector company, there is often no redress apart from a letter to the director that may or may not work. There is no ombudsman backstop in those circumstances, but there should be. Some companies are now introducing them, such as the solicitors' complaints authority, but they tend to be organised by the companies themselves, which is not a satisfactory procedure.<br><br>
Local authorities are good. Councillors do their job effectively most of the time. When they are not effective, the ombudsman acts as the backstop. The hon. Member for Truro rightly pointed out that councillors do not act appropriately in only a tiny number of cases. When that happens, the individual may go to the county court. I also agree with the hon. Member for Truro that it is unnecessarily cumbersome and convoluted for the Government to try to deal with the matter by using clause 18(2)(2E) and (2H) to increase publicity. That would not work effectively, so the Government should accept one of the amendments.<br><br>
I understand that the Minister for Local Government and the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) raised the case of Coventry. However, that case is not a good example for them to choose. It was alleged that the ombudsman's report was ignored or not put into effect. However, it was due to the all-party involvement and support that decisions were taken in the way that they were. There could have been a classic disagreement between a local authority's fiduciary duties towards its ratepayers and the need to deal with an individual's complaints. It was well debated both in full council and committee. All the councillors, regardless of whether they were Labour, Tory or whatever acted well and appropriately, and we should say so. It is another example of how amendment No. 150 could assist. In such a case, the individual would have been able to go to court and obtained a ruling that would have taken into account the local authority's fiduciary duty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely find it difficult to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. The ombudsman found it improper not once but twice that a council had refused to allow an individual to sell his shop lease to a company, had then paid him about £20,000 less than he would have received from the company and then sold it to the same company for £15,000 more. The figures might be slightly more or less, but Coventry council unashamedly said that it would not pay back the money to the individual
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
who ran a wool shop with his sister. It would be difficult to defend such a policy even if it were supported by Conservatives. The council was wrong and it should not have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misunderstood again. I advise him to talk to the Conservative members of Coventry council who agreed with its actions. The important point is not whether there was a case for doing something to help the individual but whether the council could be caught by its own fiduciary duty to maximise the return to the ratepayer. The Department of the Environment imposed that duty on it. In the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), the Department of the Environment stepped in and said that the council could not proceed as planned because that would involve breaching another regulation. It is much more complicated than the Minister realises. I urge him to take it up with his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that were true, why did not Coventry city council put forward its fiduciary duty as the reason for not doing what the ombudsman said? The council said that it would not do it because it did not want to and nothing that the ombusdman said could make it. It did not raise its fiduciary duty with me or with any other Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then it is up to the Minister to follow up my comments and decide whether he agrees with regard to Coventry. It is wrong to say that the Labour or Conservative councillors in Coventry ignored the ombusdman. It is also wrong to say that they did not treat the issue seriously. They debated it twice in committee and once on the floor of the council chamber. All those occasions were open to the public. The council said:
<br><blockquote><p>"while we may not have agreed with the Ombusdman on this occasion we have certainly not ignored him."</p></blockquote>
Incidentally, a Conservative councillor said that. He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"I must congratulate the Chief Executive and the City Secretary's departments in this matter in the way this matter has been prepared for the Ombudsman. In fact, my Lord Mayor, I must say that the referral work has been undertaken and it is very obvious that they took the complaint very seriously. To say otherwise would be incorrect and unfair."</p></blockquote>
The Minister does not understand the full complexity and is having a go at local authorities, including some of his supporters. He is fond of doing that, without examining the facts behind the fantasies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that is rather unfortunate to debate this particular case but irrespective of details, the important point is that the Minister said that the council acted unashamedly. Whatever the rights or wrongs of his statement, it shows that he believes that some councils would ignore the ombudsman's report whatever might be said against them. The whole structure that he is putting in place does not seem to add up even in his terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. If the Minister is saying that the council is so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
bad that both Labour and Tory councillors ignore the recommendations the way around it is to challenge the council in court. I am also informed that Coventry wrote to the Department of the Environment to say that in the interests of the ratepayers of Coventry it was undertaking to follow the recommendations. That letter was sent in January 1988 and I suggest that the Minister follows it up.<br><br>
When a local authority has a problem in following up an ombudsman's report either because the Department tells it that it cannot follow it up or because it clashes with another aspect of the law the way around it is to give the individual the right to go to the county court. I urge the Minister to think this through carefully and to recognise that the best way to deal with this is to accept amendment No. 150.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps a reflection of the effectiveness of the ombudsman's service that, last year, a record number of people took advantage of the opportunity to raise complaints with him. The Local Government Act 1988 gave people the right to apply to the ombudsman in their own right.<br><br>
In responding to these amendments I am put in the somewhat improbable position of defending the freedom of local authorities to take and defend their own decisions. Many of the points made by hon. Members are shared by the Government. We recognise the important role played by the local ombudsman. The White Paper on The Conduct of Local Authority Busniess states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The service has in practice proved a positive force for good, both by redressing individual grievances and by providing a spur to more responsive, efficient, and fairer local administration."</p></blockquote>
Since the establishment of the service and until July last year, there have been 150 cases in which local authorities have failed to make good the recommendations of the ombudsman. That represents around 5 per cent. of cases. I endorse the points made by hon. Members. When authorities fail to make good the ombudsman's recommendations it consolidates the sense of grievance felt by the individual concerned and makes people lose confidence in the local commissioner.<br><br>
The Government strongly believe that all local authorities should comply with the local ombudsman's recommendations. At first sight the proposals in the amendments seem to make sense: there should be some judicial or statutory enforcement. However, we believe that that would lead to much more formalised, legalistic, costly and lengthy investigations. We are concerned that complainants may also find the process much more intimidating and that flexibility would be lost. Some research in Sheffield suggested that authorities would become defensive and that the scope for their co-operation and negotiation would diminish. The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) compared the situation with that in Northern Ireland. The situation there is different as are the local authority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
responsibilities. Many of the functions are effectively discharged by quangos appointed by the Northern Ireland Department.<br><br>
We believe that the disadvantage to the system as a whole would outweigh the benefits of securing total compliance by all authorities. That was also the conclusion of the Select Committee which considered that alternative measures to encourage compliance needed to be tried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister elaborate on what she believes the difference is in Northern Ireland in terms of enforcing decisions? The only obvious difference is that the local ombudsman in Northern Ireland has the power and it has worked very effectively. The local ombudsman in England, Wales and Scotland does not have the power and the system has not worked as effectively as it should have done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole context of local government in Northern Ireland is very different, as I said, with many of the responsibilities being discharged by quangos. We are all agreed that we want the recommendations of the ombudsman to be carried out by the local authority involved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) asked for an assurance that the Department of the Environment would not instruct the local authority implementing a local ombudsman's recommendation. I am pleased that I can unequivocally give my hon. Friend that assurance. The Local Government Act 1978 remedied the problem to which he referred. The local authority always has the power to implement an ombudsman's recommendation by virtue of the 1978 Act, which inserted subsection (3) to section 31 of the Local Government Act 1974 to meet my hon. Friend's precise point. It does not surprise me that something for which he has been campaigning for some time should have been met in recent legislation.<br><br>
Several hon. Members referred to the Coventry case. Again, the Government share the view of condemning the failure to carry out the recommendations. However, further debate of the Coventry case would be more appropriate when we discuss clauses 20 and 21. They require that any decision not to comply with the local ombudsman's further report should be taken by the full council on the basis of an independent report from a person or committee not involved in the original maladministration. The Bill will require that sort of case to be given more careful independent scrutiny by authorities. I hope that that reassures hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister returns to the Coventry case, will she check with both Labour and Conservative members of Coventry council to ensure that the Government have all the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look into the matter further.<br><br>
We believe that in part II we have developed a package of reforms that are designed to enhance and strengthen the local ombudsman system, by requiring
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0651">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
that any decision not to comply with the ombudsman's decision can be taken by the full council. We can debate those aspects further when we reach the appropriate clauses.<br><br>
We believe that those steps will encourage compliance without sacrificing the independent and informal nature of the system, which is the fundamental principle on which it was founded. Contributions by members of the Committee today have shown that that principle has already gained much respect and confidence. It is worthy of our protection, and I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's comments unconvincing. I realise that she and other members of the Committee may be anxious to get away, but the amendment deserved a more considered response. The ombudsmen, who are directly involved in the service believe that this is a necessary and important part of their work and the proposal would help them enormously in carrying
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
out their work. The Widdicombe report also believed that that was the case.<br><br>
Because it is late, because I do not believe that the Minister has dealt with the amendment as she should have done, and because I do not want to prevent us from debating the matter on Report, I shall not press the amendment to a Division. What the hon. Lady said made me believe that the proposal merits further substantial debate and should be put before the House at a time when hon. Members are not constrained by an understandable desire to rush out and do other things, as they are on Budget day.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Chapman.</i>]</p>
