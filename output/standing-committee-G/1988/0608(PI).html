<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 72 and schedule 6 build on and complete the tax reform programme for pensions, introduced in 1987, and make important changes.<br><br>
First, they deregulate pensions. In future Inland Revenue rules will no longer determine the maximum benefits that an employer may provide. Secondly, they make the tax rules for pensions fairer through introducing an earnings cap on the tax-privileged benefits available to certain very high earners, and other changes will improve the position of ordinary scheme members. They will also make the tax rules simpler, especially in relation to the payment of additional voluntary contributions. I shall deal with those three changes in turn.<br><br>
On deregulation, at present all occupational pension schemes that give an employee an entitlement to benefits have, in effect, to be approved by the Inland Revenue. Failure to obtain approval of a scheme would put at risk the tax-approved status of any other approved scheme of which the employee was a member. In that way tax approval rules have become a limit on total pensions that an employer may pay. Such a restriction is clearly not appropriate. Employers should have the freedom to offer whatever pension benefits are necessary to recruit or retain key employees. The changes in schedule 6 make that possible by removing the requirement that all schemes for an employee should be considered together to see whether, in total, the tax rules are satisfied. In future it will be necessary to apply the test only to schemes that attract the special pensions tax advantages.<br><br>
The change will make it possible for employers to set up "top-up" schemes that provide more generous benefits than are allowed under the tax rules. For example, some employers may want to give a pension of more than two-thirds salary; or they may want to give a two-thirds pension where the tax rules do not allow it, such as where 20 years' service cannot be completed with the final employer; or, in the case of new employees who are subject to the Budget changes, employers may want to pension earnings above the limit of £60,000.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
Although it is right that employers should have that choice, it is clearly not appropriate that top-up schemes should benefit from any of the special tax reliefs enjoyed by approved schemes, so we propose special tax rules governing payments to, and benefits from, top-up schemes to ensure that they do not enjoy tax privileges. The effect will be that benefits from top-up schemes will normally be charged to tax either as they accrue—if the scheme is funded—or when they are paid in the case of an unfunded scheme. In that way it is possible to allow the schemes to operate without any restrictions on the form and amount of the benefits payable: they will be matters solely for employers and employees to agree between themselves.<br><br>
On the ceiling on tax relief, now that employers can provide retirement benefits without being restricted by tax rules, there is no longer a case for continuing with the present arrangements under which tax benefits are available to those in approved schemes without any upper limit to the pension payable. The measures announced on Budget day therefore included a proposal for a cash limit based on earnings of £60,000. That limit will allow a tax-approved occupational pension scheme to pay a pension of up to £40,000 a year, part of which may be commuted for a tax-free lump sum of up to £90,000. Beyond that, tax relief will not be available.<br><br>
That brings the pensions tax relief into line with other tax-received savings arrangements where limits operate similarly, such as personal equity plans and the business expansion scheme. By setting the limit at that level, we have ensured that it affects only those on very high incomes. The vast majority of pension scheme members are unaffected and those who are will still be able to obtain a good level of benefit. Why should the Government, through the tax system, subsidise without limit the pensions of very high earners? That principle operates in other countries and most people will accept that it is an equitable proposal.<br><br>
The third element of the occupational pensions package relates to the requirements for additional voluntary contributions. For tax purposes, they are treated as an integral part of an employee's occupational pension benefits and are subject to the normal benefit limits. However, the present rules are complex and have some unintended effects. In particular, if the AVC investment does better than expected, the present rules can require the employer's main scheme to reduce its benefits to keep the total benefits—those from the scheme and the AVC together—within tax approval limits. As a result, the incentive to select the best investment is diminished. If it did spectacularly well, the employee might not enjoy the benefit but would instead subsidise the employer's costs. That is clearly not desirable and we have received many representations about it. We therefore propose that if surplus AVC funds arise, they should in future be returned to the employee. But as contributions to the scheme and the investment build-up on its funds will have enjoyed tax relief, the payment to the employee will be chargeable to tax at a special rate. As AVC savings are not intended to be a tax-privileged form of general savings which is sometimes misunderstood, the tax
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
charge will broadly recover both sets of tax relief—that on contributions and that on build-up.<br><br>
To keep the administration of the charge simple, responsibility for deducting and accounting for tax will rest with the AVC scheme. But the amount paid to the employee will be treated as income that has been paid net of basic rate tax, so for everyone other than higher taxpayers there will be no further tax liability.<br><br>
That new approch to surplus AVC funds has made possible a major improvement to the administrative procedures controlling the payment of AVCs. One of the main complaints was that the administrative rules were extremely complex and burdensome for employers because tax relief pushed the funds above the benefit limit. Many people have found the procedures unduly burdensome and so have been reluctant to co-operate to make free-standing AVC schemes a success. But the new tax charge on surplus AVC funds makes it possible to look again at AVC procedures. We recently consulted pension bodies over proposals radically to simplify the initial requirements. The new procedures will keep to a minimum employer involvement in the employees' setting up free-standing AVC plans. In most cases there will be no involvement at all. The changes have been warmly welcomed by the pensions industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister explained the reasoning behind the Government's ceiling on pensions. I agree with the thrust of his argument. There cannot be an unlimited taxpayers' subsidy to the creation of pensions. However, several questions must be answered.<br><br>
Why did not the Government consult on all the proposals that they have put before the House, when they consulted so widely on many other aspects of pensions? There is no doubt that the Government are engaged on a major consultation procedure in relation to their life insurance taxation proposals and have listened to many of the responses that they received. Another question is the Government's choice of prices rather than earnings as a means of indexing the £60,000 ceiling. That raises the possibility of the effective ceiling being brought down in real terms over the years from the high reward package for employees whom the company considers to be of exceptional value to a wide range of normal salary earners. If that is the Government's intention, they should make it clearer. If they intend to reduce considerably this range of tax relief on the way to removing it entirely, they should come clean about it. They should at least review whether the ceiling, controlled as it will be by prices indexation, is being brought down into the general run of salaries rather than remaining at the level of this high reward package.<br><br>
It would be a pity if the Government earned widespread condemnation for the way in which they dealt with the principle, which has considerable support, that there should be a ceiling on tax contribution pensions. We welcomed the ceiling when the Budget proposals were announced and it is certainly right in principle.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) will excuse any discourtesy if I reply only briefly to his points. The issues that he has just touched on are dealt with in the next group of amendments. He has identified key issues, but we need not debate them twice.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked why we did not consult. We did consult on some points. Decisions, especially the changes in the refunds of AVCs, were the result of representations and discussions with many institutions. Those changes do not amount to a fundamental change requiring a Green Paper, if that is what he was suggesting. We shall debate what proportions of the labour force will be affected, but it will be a small number by any standards. Sometimes the City has an unrealistic view of how many people earn above £60,000. I think that I am right in saying that 0.2 per cent. of the labour force earn over £60,000, not all of whom will be affected by this ceiling because they are already in tax-approved schemes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that the ceiling was being lowered. It is not; it is being indexed and so cannot be lowered. The argument about its relationship to other people's earnings is different from saying that it has been lowered. That point has been misrepresented in some of the wild comments that have been made.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) cannot be present today, I have agreed, so far as I can, to put the compelling arguments for the amendment. I must tell my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that, although almost everyone agrees with the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) that there is nothing offensive in applying a limit on tax relief to pension schemes, the way in which the proposals in the Bill have been arrived at, and their details, cause some concern.<br><br>
In 1985, the Chancellor undertook in his Budget speech not to make a fundamental reform of the tax treatment of pension funds without the publication of a Green Paper. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary claimed that this does not constitute a fundamental change in the tax treatment of pensions, and it is true that few people currently earn more than £60,000 a year. However, that begs the question of what will happen if, as is confidently expected, more people are affected because the growth in earnings outstrips the price level. The figures supplied to me by the National Association of Pension Funds show that average earnings have moved steadily ahead of the retail price index in the past 25 years. In the past 10 years, they have moved ahead at an average of 2.5 per cent. a year. If that continues, in 30 years' time the value of the new ceiling on earnings will have declined, in today's terms, to £28,600 a year. That is a much lower figure, but even at today's levels relatively few people would earn that. Inevitably, with the effluxion of time, the real nature of the cap on tax relief will affect many more people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why is the hon. Gentleman bothered about this, which regards the wealthy, but not about the failure to tie basic pensions to the standard of living rather than to inflation? Why does he not campaign on behalf of those on lower pensions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That takes us into a different area of policy which we could debate at length. I am in favour of, in effect, privatising pensions and having properly funded pension schemes for everybody. To make people less dependent on the state pension is one of the achievements of the Government over the past 10 years, and it will have hugely beneficial effects in the long term. People on the basic pension should share in the growth of prosperity for which the Government can claim credit. If the hon. Gentleman considers the real earnings of pensioners over the past 10 years, he will realise that they have advanced considerably. However, I do not wish to be drawn into a general debate on pensions and I am sure that you, Mr. Crowther, would applaud my reticence. It is also convenient.<br><br>
I emphasise that a growing proportion of people will be affected by the cap on tax relief, and it will not be just the wealthy. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie may know that the Trades Union Congress has said that, in time, ordinary working people will lose out as a result of the changes. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wishes to put himself at odds with the TUC. If the block vote is abolished within the Labour party, that will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
be greatly liberating for his party and he may be able to disagree with the trade union paymasters more easily.<br><br>
Assuming that we continue to have a Conservative rather than a Labour Government, the logic is inescapable that earnings will grow much faster than the level of prices. Under a Labour Government the reverse might apply. Nevertheless, a significantly increased number of people will be affected by the cap over a time. Consequently there is concern that the tax relief will wither away. There are arguments in favour of that and for providing for neutrality in various forms of pension provision. The Chancellor may have referred to that wider argument in his speech in 1985 when he said that if there were to be a fundamental reform, he would consider such issues. However, it is unfortunate that we are eating away at the present system without a fundamental review.<br><br>
Will my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary consider the long-term effects? The full effect of the legislation may not be felt for 30, 40, 50 or 60 years, by which time we shall be long beyond pensionable age. Over decades Governments can change their policies, so I fully appreciate that my argument is academic. Nevertheless, this serious question should be answered because we are fundamentally changing the present system. My right hon. Friend owes us an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are those who allege that the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) is the real-life model for Mr. Alan B'stard in "The New Statesman". I do not believe that, but it is rumoured so widely that the hon. Gentleman thinks that he has to live up to the image, but there is no need to do it all the time.<br><br>
In speaking to our four amendments that are grouped with the more disreputable ones from the Conservative Back Benches, I wish to make it clear that we wish to separate ours from those of Conservative Members. The Financial Secretary referred to the issue of principle when speaking to clause 72—which is qualified by the conditions of schedule 6—of whether there should be a ceiling on earnings that qualify for benefits in an occupational pension scheme. If so, what terms and conditions should apply now and in future?<br><br>
On the issue of principle, the parliamentary Labour party supports the ceiling and thinks that the Government have got the level about right. There is always an arbitrary aspect to any figure that is chosen, and the Government have probably chosen wisely—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I seem to have incited some discontent on the Government Back Benches. Fear not, Financial Secretary, we shall support the proposal. After his rumbustious performance when we discussed ESOPs on Tuesday, I thought that the right hon. Gentleman might prefer to speak to clauses and schedules from the Opposition Benches rather than from the Government Benches. That performance was greeted with cheers from the Opposition but rather glum faces on the Benches behind the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gedling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The slight agitation on the Government Back Benches merely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0192">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
notes that the two Front Benches appear to agree, which encourages my colleagues and me to have another look at some of the provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the hon. Gentleman should have another look if he considers that important. The hon. Gentleman is a new Member with a great future. May I suggest that as well as having another look, he has another think?<br><br>
Our amendments meet the points raised by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) in our short debate on clause 72, so I assume that he will vote with us at the end of this debate. We support the imposition of a ceiling because, without one, the schemes offer the potential for tax avoidance and tax shelter for a relatively small number of affluent people. The Financial Secretary said that the numbers involved are quite small. I do not know what estimate he has; I think that some 120,000 people currently earn over £60,000 a year.<br><br>
We are talking about the sort of money that ordinary pensioners in my constituency, in your constituency, Mr. Crowther, and in the constituencies of most hon. Members, will not receive throughout their entire retirement. It comes ill from the Conservative party to say that such an already privileged group of people should be advantaged a little more when Conservative Back Benchers have nothing to say about index-linking the state pension, as was done under Labour Governments. That index-linking was shamefully abolished under the Conservative Government that those Back Benchers support. Those who read <i>Hansard</i> will take careful note of the priorities of Conservative Back Benchers. I hope that they will also take careful note of the priorities of the parliamentary Labour party. We are saying that if public money is available to be spent on pensioners, it should be spent on the generality of pensioners, not on the wealthy and the privileged few.<br><br>
The amendments deal with two specific points. The second, and perhaps less contentious, point was mentioned by the hon. Member for Tatton and it is probably the only point on which I agree with him. It concerns the original promise made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1985 not to undertake any reform of the tax treatment of pension funds without first publishing a Green Paper. Our amendment provides for the publication of a Green Paper. The Financial Secretary has already revealed his argument that the issue is not the generality of pension schemes but the treatment of the wealthy. The promise was that there would be no reform of the tax treatment of pensions without a Green Paper. That promise has not been adhered to, and the purpose of our amendment is to ensure that it is.<br><br>
The other argument is not so much about where the threshold should be now, but where it should be in one, two and three years' time. Today's <i>Financial Times</i> has a leader on the topic, which suggests that there are those who suspect that the proposals before us are a
<br><blockquote><p>"sneaky attempt to impose a gradually falling cap in real terms".</p></blockquote>
The Labour party feels that that would be wrong if the present threshold is right. If it is broadly right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
now—we are not saying that it will be right for ever—we assume that, all other things being equal, it will endure for the future. To ensure that there is at least some assurance that the matter will be reviewed and, if necessary, the threshold upgraded, our amendment specifically calls for regular reviews. The implication of that is that there would be regular regrading in the light of experience and the general position of the economy.<br><br>
The <i>Financial Times</i> suggests that there are those who believe that the Government have no commitment to occupational pension schemes and that the purpose of the measure is to set a threshold, which would gradually erode the amount of money that could be put into such a scheme with benefit, to persuade people to move from occupational schemes to personal pension plans. I hope that the Financial Secretary will deal with that specifically. If that is the intention, it would be wrong. I hope that the fears expressed in the <i>Financial Times</i> and by the industry are unfounded. If our amendment, which would commit the Government to a periodic review, were accepted, the strength of those arguments would be diminished.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
It all comes down to the Government's intentions and good faith. Some people allege that good faith is not present and cannot be relied on. That is the most significant of all the issues involved in the debate and I hope that the Financial Secretary will give it special attention when he responds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Labour party's amendments. We believe that the state pension should be tied to the standard of living, but that has not happened during the years of the Tory Government. It would be an outrage if state pensions were not tied to the general standard of living or if some of the Tory Back Bench proposals to link this provision to the standard of living were accepted. There is no case for treating the wealthy more favourably than those who depend on the state pension. After the departure from tying pensioners' pensions to the standard of living, single people are being paid £11.90 per week less and couples £18.70 per week less than they would have been if that link had been maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By how much would the weekly rates of national insurance contribution or the rates of personal income tax need to rise to fund such an increase?</span></p>

(Dr. Moonie) said—about the unfairness to pensioners of the Government's policies. If this is a tax allowance, it is like the old saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch—it has to be paid for. Giving a tax allowance to wealthy people has to be justified much more than giving it to anybody else, because it is likely that it is paid for by those who are less well off than those who receive it.<br><br>
The Chancellor has declared on various occasions that he wishes to proceed to a level playing field on taxation, but we are disappointed that that has not occurred at the speed that we want. I depart from my party's views to some extent on maintaining this benefit at this time and at this level. I want to go further and gradually abolish tax concessions on pensions, because the money could be used in a much better way. The Government are clearly phasing out mortgage interest relief—although they do not want that drawn to people's attention—because they see it as unfair. The tax relief on pensions should also be phased out eventually.<br><br>
Many existing tax reliefs are not given to provide for the security of people in their old age; they are as much a tax haven as the Cayman Islands. The concessions are provided by the Inland Revenue—although the Revenue is probably against them—at the behest of the Treasury to provide what the Lombard column in the <i>Financial Times</i> was referring to when it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is a very good case for restricting the availability of the tax privileges associated with pension funds. The purpose of granting tax relief…is to encourage people (and their employers) to provide for their old age. But pension funds have been widely used as tax shelters by the very rich, who are not in any danger of destitution in retirement."</p></blockquote>
I concur with that. We should do what the Centre for Policy Studies proposes in a booklet entitled:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pensions and Privilege: how to end the scandal, simplify taxes and widen ownership",</p></blockquote>
and advocate scrapping
<br><blockquote><p>"all the tax concessions on pension schemes and the treatment of all future contributions by companies as taxable benefits, using the money saved by the Government to reduce the overall rate of tax still further."</p></blockquote>
I would go along with this as a level playing field approach that would allow people's means to be taken into account when they are paying taxes. At present, there is no means testing for mortgage interest relief and tax relief on pension schemes. We are distributing money from the poor to the rich because those who earn least must pay for the tax concessions.<br><br>
If there is money to spend on pensions, it should go to state pensioners, who are the least well off. There is controversy about how badly or well off they are. I know that in my constituency, far too many pensioners still depend on second-hand clothing. Far too many pensioners have to choose between eating and heating, even in the mildest of winters. If money is available for the comfort of elderly people, it should go to those on basic pensions.<br><br>
No one in this country can be satisfied with the fact that, without a private pension, British pensioners receive only £43.60 a week after a lifetime's work. That compares with £74 a week for pensioners in the Netherlands, £89 a week in France, £79 a week in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
Luxembourg, £72 a week in Denmark and £71 a week in Italy. For us to allow tax concessions on pensions which are steered towards the wealthy is not satisfactory.<br><br>
I want to go further than my party in this matter. We should be working towards the abolition of many of the existing tax allowances to lower the general rate of taxation and to ensure, at long last, that people's incomes and benefits are treated fairly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The publicity that this issue has had since the Budget is amazing. An article in <i>The Guardian</i> on 20 May was headlined:
<br><blockquote><p>"D-Day for the high-flyers".</p></blockquote>
It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Next weekend is going to be crucial for all high earners—those already earning £60,000, or the 35-year-old now on £25,000 who expects to reach that figure by the time of retirement.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>For most of us June 1 means the start of summer; this year high earners will see that date as the start of certain Budget changes which could seriously affect the pensions they may enjoy in retirement."</p></blockquote>
The article examines in detail the plight of the high earner and the possibility that he may be short of a crust of bread, come his or her retirement.<br><br>
The personal finance column of the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> of 21 May carried an article entitled,
<br><blockquote><p>"The big pension cap time bomb".</p></blockquote>
It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every budget contains a time bomb, an announcement which seems harmless at the time but which blows up in your face later. This year's could be the Chancellor's 'cap' on pensionable salaries."</p></blockquote>
In the <i>Financial Times,</i> Lombard complains about the "Backdoor reform of pensions". I sympathise with the fact that high earners face the possibility of a savage attack on their retirement pension by a Government whom the vast majority of them steadfastly voted into power in the past few years. They must look to the people whom they have put in power to govern the country for them, and this proposal comes from those people. In that sense, I cannot cry too many tears over their predicament.<br><br>
However, the Government have acted churlishly and in an underhand fashion in introducing this change. Although the Financial Secretary has said, here and elsewhere, that this reform is not fundamental and affects only a small number of earners—about 120,000, or 3.5 per cent—everybody involved in the pensions industry believes that it is a fundamental change in the structure of the service that they can offer. That is why the amendment is sensible. We should not accept, willy-nilly, the concept of tying pensions to the retail price index in future.<br><br>
Nor should we automatically tie pensions to the average rise in earnings, because the average is taken from different groups' earnings which rise at different levels. It is much better to allow pensions to be reviewed periodically. Although we broadly support the Government's move, we believe it rather churlish of them not to honour the Chancellor's pledge of 1985 to publish a Green Paper on pension reform when a proposal that could be regarded as a fundamental change was made. One of the amendments is designed with that in mind, although
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
it might be beyond the hopes of common sense to expect the Government to accept it this afternoon.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
We have not had a full explanation of what the Government are trying to do. It is good that the Government are keen that this should not be used as a method of high-powered tax evasion. In an article entitled
<br><blockquote><p>"The shelter won't be demolished yet"</p></blockquote>
John Edwards writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pension schemes provide the most important 'shelter' for legally avoiding payment of tax on savings or investments."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the Government are trying to undermine the occupational scheme in favour of the personal pension scheme, even though occupational schemes are cheaper to administer.<br><br>
With appropriate safeguards to enable members to transfer to other schemes when they change employment—they already exist to a certain extent—occupational schemes should be protected. This proposal is perhaps a step towards undermining that type of pension provision. It is interesting that the Inland Revenue press release on pension changes emphasises the greater flexibility of pension provision and the extent to which the individual can play a greater part in developing his own pension, when occupational schemes, by and large, perform very well.<br><br>
Although I broadly support the £60,000 limit and its review, it is the amendment tabled by the Labour party that attracts me, not that provided by the Government within schedule 6. It is a pity that there is not more in the proposal to help people on a basic state pension. We have heard how a single person has lost £11.90 a week and a married couple nearly £18 a week through the changes that the Government made some years ago.<br><br>
In view of the statements made outside the House by the Secretary of State for Social Security on the supposed wealth of pensioners, we must remember that two thirds of pensioners rely on state benefits for 80 per cent. of their income. The real concern should be to increase the state pension, not to tinker with schemes for high earners. As I said, it is probably beyond the bounds of common sense to expect the Government to accept the amendment, but we live in hope.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in the rare and pleasant position of speaking broadly in favour of the Government's proposals in two successive sittings. The Financial Secretary had better not get carried away, as it will not happen too often. He should take advantage of it while he can.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) has put his finger on the real bone of contention. Despite all the Chancellor's protestations and the good intentions of the more economically liberal of his hon. Friends, our tax system is still bedevilled with allowances for this and that, particularly for middle and high wage-earners. We should be committed to doing away with that in the long term, if not in the short term.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
Mortgage interest relief, PEPs, the low taxation on perks such as luxury cars and the tax relief on pension fund contributions are all examples of undeserved and unearned tax breaks. They are unjustified by any test of fairness.<br><br>
Let us consider mortgage interest relief. Any honest Conservative Member would probably agree with those of us who want to do away with it. In practical terms, it is probably better to let it wither away by failing to uprate it, as has been done for several years, rather than take the more shocking step of doing away with it at one fell swoop. That is fair enough. Why, then, cannot the same test be applied to pension relief? Why uprate it at all? Why not accept the principle that its value will be allowed to erode over the years? We should allow it to wither away.<br><br>
There is nothing to complain about in what the Government have proposed in the circumstances. They have at least accepted the principle that there should be a ceiling on the amount allowable against tax. That is a step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin with the usual disclaimer that I have no personal interest in the amendments. More unusually, I do not even have a constituency interest in them. I do not think that any of the 120,000 individuals who earn more than £60,000 a year lives in my constituency. If they do, I have certainly not met them yet. That must explain why I have been singularly free from the intense lobbying that Conservative Members have had regarding these provisions. We have seen evidence of that in some of the contributions to the Committee.<br><br>
Given the pension industry's deafening silence when the same thing happened to state pensions, it strikes me as hypocritical that it should complain about the fact that in future the ceiling will be index-linked only to prices rather than to average earnings, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) said, one of the Government's first acts was to cut the index link to wages for state pensioners. As a result, pensioners have lost a cumulative total of about £20 billion since the early 1980s. That £20 billion saving has been made on the backs of state pensioners.<br><br>
We should deduct from the famous Budget surplus that the Government have accummulated in the past financial year the receipts from selling Government assets through privatisation measures and the sale of council houses. Those one off-items would not be counted in any reasonable, properly handled Budget—it is an accounting trick to include them. If we deducted those receipts, in addition to the money that the Government have saved in the past financial year alone from removing the state pensioners' index link to wages, that would account for the Budget surplus. If we take into account the sums that the Government have gained from North sea oil, we realise that there has been no economic miracle. The surplus has arisen because assets have been sold off and pensioners have been robbed.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
several amendments, but he addressed his remarks mainly to the issue of the Green Paper. Perhaps he tabled his other amendments to initiate a debate on the principles of the clause and the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) identified.<br><br>
I hope to demonstrate that the changes do not amount to a fundamental reform of the tax regime for pensions and that a Green Paper would not therefore be appropriate. I shall go into detail on the points that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton raised, but before I do so, I remind the Committee of the pledge given by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer about what would happen if there were a fundamental change. On 19 March 1985 my right hon. Friend said—the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will be particularly interested in this because in one sense it slightly echoes what he said—
<br><blockquote><p>"There is also a case for changing the tax treatment of pension funds, as part of a thorough-going reform for personal savings generally. Any fundamental reform of this kind would … need to be preceded by … a Green Paper."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 March 1985; Vol. 75, c. 795.]</p></blockquote>
In 1985 there was a great deal of debate on such changes and the institutions and those affected reacted strongly. That led to my right hon. Friend's pledge.<br><br>
This is not a fundamental change. Even in the long term, it will affect only a small number of people. Furthermore, it could not be described as changing the basis of taxing pension funds, nor is it part of an overall comprehensive reform of a taxing of savings.<br><br>
The principle of a cap exists in several countries. In the United States the level is $98,000—£62,000—and is indexed by prices, as we propose. In Canada, the limit is much lower than our proposal.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) suggested that we were trying to undermine occupational pension schemes to promote personal pension schemes. I deny that. The cap will also apply to personal pensions; £60,000 pensionable earnings can be put into a personal pension. Of course we want to encourage personal pensions because they help mobility, but occupational pension schemes play, and will continue to play, an important part in providing security for people in their retirement.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton for moving the amendment and thereby allowing the issues to be debated. My hon. Friend spoke to the subsequent amendments dealing with the indexation of the cap. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) tabled amendment No. 293, which would increase the ceiling from £60,000 to £100,000. We considered that before the Budget, but we have seen or heard nothing to convince us that £100,000 would be more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the figure of £100,000 was chosen because it would be consistent with the ceiling set on earnings for commutation purposes by the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987. Will my right hon. Friend answer that point?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is to do with the lump sum. I do not see that there is a read across from that to this limit.<br><br>
The Government's policy has been to reduce high rates of marginal taxation on higher earners. We have always said that step by step alongside that reduction should go the reduction of some tax reliefs. We have taken several steps to block loopholes and last year raised £800 million by doing so.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that tax reliefs simply distort the market and that if they are removed, the market will reach its own solution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have acquiesced in many tax reliefs and have introduced others because they fulfil a particular function.<br><br>
I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton that I made the point on the clause stand part debate that we are also deregulating the regime for occupational pensions and people can pay any level of pension that they wish. I simply question whether the taxpayer and the Government should pay part of the cost. Some of my friends in the City are keener on our tax reductions than on our policy of blocking loopholes and reliefs, but that must accompany tax reductions in the top rates.<br><br>
It has been suggested that the £60,000 earnings cap will adversely affect job mobility. The easy answer would be to have no transitional provisions and, therefore, no effect on job mobility. However, that would have been unfair and unthinkable, and would have interfered with people's legitimate expectations. I do not see why it should affect job mobility, because people can pay a non-tax relief pension of any level they wish and to top up over and above the £60,000 limit.<br><br>
Some companies have asserted that they cannot afford that. It may be a good thing for employers to come face to face with the cost of employing people instead of expecting the Government to pay part of that cost. The cost of someone's pension above £60,000 should be brought home to employers.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton suggested a method of indexing the earnings cap. We gave careful thought to the method of indexation when we designed the pension changes. Despite arguments that have been put forward, we remain convinced that prices indexation is the most appropriate approach. First, it is used in other parts of the tax system—for example for personal allowances. Secondly, and more importantly, it will be indexed. I say that in response to comments that the cap will be eroded and that in a few years' time it will be worth £35,000 or £28,000. The real value of the limit will be maintained. It is only by maintaining that real value that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was able to propose other aspects of the package, in particular the new freedom to pay top-up pensions without any of the old constraints on maximum benefits.<br><br>
I listened to what my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton said and I have read some of the articles to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
which the hon. Member for Bridgend referred about the long-term effects of the decision to adopt just prices indexation. If earnings grow faster than inflation, it is true that the cap will gradually apply to more people. However, that needs to be kept in perspective. At present, very few people earn more than £60,000 a year, and because of the transitional arrangements the initial impact of the cap will be small. I gave a figure of 0.2 per cent, of the labour force, but I emphasised that not all of them would be affected because many of them are in tax privileged funds and will remain so.<br><br>
The number of people who will be affected in the future cannot be predicted with certainty. We estimate, assuming a real growth in earnings of 2.5 per cent., which is a generous assumption in the long run, that in 40 years' time 2.4 per cent. of the work force will receive pensions that are subject to the cap. Forty years is a long time and, given the gap between most people's pensions and the cap, they will be affected only to a limited extent.<br><br>
I have also seen suggestions by the National Association of Pension Funds of what will happen in 70 years' time, but it is difficult to look that far ahead. It is considering those who will be joining the labour force in 40 years' time and the impact of the cap on them 40 years later—in 70 or 80 years from now. Even then the National Association of Pension Funds expect that less than half of all employees will be affected. Many things may happen by then. We may even publish a Green Paper, but that is not a commitment. Many of those employees would be only partially affected because of the gap between the cap and the tax privileged part of their pension.<br><br>
The evidence is not there that this measure is a fundamental change, and it does not justify the rhetoric of the NAPF. It produced a pamphlet called "Truth, Honour and Democracy" which sounds as though it was written by the right hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Foot). It has echoes of guilty men. The pamphlet concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Government proceeds with the Chancellor's proposal in its present form, the implications for our parliamentary democracy will be horrendous indeed."</p></blockquote>
The measure cannot be portrayed in that way.<br><br>
I object to the NAPF pamphlet going on about young people. We are talking about a few higher-paid people. We have received hundreds of letters on this matter, all from company directors. There is no evidence that this proposal is a fundamental erosion of the régime. It will affect only a small minority. The facts that I have given to the Committee show that even in 40 years' time only a small number of people will be affected. The number may be less small when those who are just joining the labour force retire 30 years later, but it is ridiculous to look that far ahead and maintain that we cannot do what other countries do and place a cap on this generous tax privilege that is available for occupational pension schemes.<br><br>
The real scandal of occupational pensions, which has not been dealt with, is the 10 million people who do not belong to them. It would have been better if NAPF had directed its attention to those who do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
belong to such schemes, rather than concentrating on a small number of people at the top end of the market. Our proposals are eminently sensible and equitable and go naturally side by side with the very generous tax reductions for higher-paid managers that we have given in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Financial Secretary. The promise in the Green Paper should be honoured. The fears expressed by the TUC and others would be met by our other amendment, which requires a periodic review. We do not maintain that the Government should do anything more than review the position in future. Inserting a commitment to a review would meet many of the objections that have been made. I have heard no convincing argument about why the issue should not be kept under review, so I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for his kind words about me at the beginning of his speech. However, some of my hon. Friends may take exception to the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon) keeps a close watch on all his colleagues from all parties in the north-east and will take such comfort from the hon. Gentleman's remarks as he can.<br><br>
I listened with care to the speech of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary who made some telling points. I also favour reducing the anomalies and the special treatment of certain aspects of earnings in the tax system. I am very much in favour of the ultimate simplification of income tax—its complete abolition. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor was not able to commit himself to that in the Chamber this afternoon, following the question of my parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Butler). Pending the millenium, which we can achieve after another 10 years of Conservative Government, we must put up with what we have.<br><br>
The argument will continue. I am speaking principally on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) who said that he does not want me to acquire the reputation of a troublemaker. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) has done his work extremely well this afternoon by producing cohorts of Government supporters on the Government Benches. I shall not press the amendment to a Division because I have no wish to steal the thunder of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 183, line 10, leave out "section" and insert "subsection".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 249 to 251.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments which follow from the inclusion of a reference to an employee's personal representatives in sub-paragraph (1) of section 599A in Government amendment No. 247. The taxation of a deceased person's estate can be complicated, but it broadly operates to transfer ultimate liability to the beneficiaries. This is done by deeming payments of income to have suffered basic rate income tax.<br><br>
Despite provisions such as section 599A(6), which are intended to prevent any part of the special 35 per cent. tax charge being repaid, the beneficiaries would, under the Bill as drafted, be entitled to a basic rate tax credit. As the purpose of the special tax charge is broadly to recover the benefit of tax relief on contributions and tax-free build-up of funds, this result was not intended.<br><br>
The amendments, therefore, restrict the charge to higher rate tax to payments of surplus funds made to or for the benefit of an employee in his lifetime and, at the same time, prevent any repayments of tax where surplus funds are paid to his estate after his death.</span></p>

The tax charge on repayments of surplus additional voluntary contribution funds is intended to apply in all circumstances in which surpluses can arise. Schedule 6, in its present form, would apply the tax
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
charge only where the surplus became payable to an employee on his or her retirement. But surplus funds can also arise following a scheme member's death: the amendment therefore makes it clear that tax is chargeable on payments made to a deceased scheme member's personal representatives.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments meet representations made by a number of bodies about the effect of a particular aspect of the proposals. The contributions that individuals may make to a tax-approved occupational pension scheme is set at 15 per cent. of earnings. That limit will for the future be subject to the proposed earnings ceiling, so initially the effect is to limit contributions to £9,000 in the current income tax year.<br><br>
Paragraphs 5, 6 and 21 apply the contribution limit to all scheme members from 6 April 1989. Unlike the earnings ceiling as it applies to benefits, no protection was included for existing scheme members. That approach was adopted with the objective of minimising administrative complications for pension schemes, and it did not seem likely to cause practical problems for those intending to contribute more.<br><br>
However, since publication of the bill we have received a number of representations on this point putting forward the case that without transitional arrangements the limit will harm some people's pension expectations. They also suggested that operating different rules for new and existing members would not be a serious problem. We accept the case that has been made. These amendments ensure that the cap on employee contributions, like the cap on retirement benefits, will apply only to new schemes, and to new members joining existing schemes from 1 June 1989.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most occupational pension schemes qualify for tax approval, provided that the benefits that may be paid do not exceed certain limits. Paragraph 20 of schedule 6 overrides the rules of existing approved schemes to give effect to the £60,000 earnings cap. There are, however, some occupational schemes that have no controls on the benefits that may be paid. Instead, there are limits on the total contributions that may be paid to the scheme. Paragraph 20, as drafted, does not apply to those schemes. The new subparagraph (2A) will put right that drafting defect and override the rules of those types of scheme in order to apply the £60,000 earnings cap for the purpose of calculating contributions.</span></p>

<p>26A.—(1) Where the scheme is a centralised scheme, sub-paragraph (1)(a) and (b) of each of paragraphs 20 and 21A to 26 above shall have effect with the substitution for the reference to the coming into existence of the scheme of a reference to the commencement of the employer's participation in the scheme.</p>
<p>(2) For the purposes of this paragraph a centralised scheme is a retirement benefits scheme (within the meaning of Chapter I of Part XIV of the Taxes Act 1988) established for the purpose of enabling any employer, other than an employer associated with the person by whom the scheme is established, to participate in it as regards his employees.</p>
<p>(3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) above one person is associated with another if (directly or indirectly) one is controlled by the other or if both are controlled by a third person.</p>
<p>(4) In sub-paragraph (3) above the reference to control, in relation to a body corporate, shall be construed—

<li>where the body corporate is a close company, in accordance with section 416 of the Taxes Act 1988, and</li>
<li>where it is not, in accordance with section 840 of that Act.".</li></ol></p>
<p>The amendment corrects a defect in schedule 6. Most pension schemes are set up to provide benefit only for the employees of a single company or of a group of associated employers, but some pension schemes do not require that close connection between employers. They are commonly known as centralised schemes and are set up for employers in specific industries, but others are more general arrangements that are open to any employer.</p>
<p>If centralised schemes were in existence at Budget day, the employees of firms who joined one before 1 June would not, as the Bill is drafted, be subject to the new rules set out in the schedule, but if the employers had set up new schemes of their own after Budget day, the provisions of schedule 6 would have applied.</p>
<p>The proposed new paragraph 26A closes that loophole by treating participation in a centralised scheme as if it were a new scheme.</p>

However, many AVC arrangements are an integral part of the employer's main occupational scheme. Part III of schedule 6 will not, as drafted, apply in those cases, thus denying members of those schemes access to the new approach to surplus AVC funds.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with drafting shortcomings in clause 73. The intention is that non-approved top-up pension schemes should not benefit from the tax advantages available to approved occupational schemes. Clause 73 specifies the circumstances in which a deduction for the costs incurred by an employer in providing top-up benefits will not be due. As drafted, the clause disallows those costs unless the employee is chargeable to either on the contributions to the top-up scheme or the benefits paid under such a scheme, but it says nothing about the timing of deductions where costs are allowable.<br><br>
The effect is that an employer could claim a deduction in advance of payments being made if, at some point in the future, the employee would be chargeable to tax on these payments. The amendments prevent an employer from obtaining such a timing advantage.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are alternatives. They are intended to explore the Government's thinking rather than to alter the Bill. Schedule 7(2)(3) deletes the provision that places a cap of £150,000 on tax-free lump sums that can be obtained via personal pension schemes. Perhaps that is because such a figure could not be met practically now that the ceiling has been introduced, or perhaps there is another reason. Amendment No. 380 would reduce the figure of £150,000 to £90,000. We chose that figure because it is equivalent to one a half times final salary under an occupational scheme with a £60,000 cap on earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendment No. 379. Under the personal pensions legislation the maximum amount of lump sum payable is, broadly, 25 per cent. of the total funds. In addition, present legislation imposes a ceiling of £150,000 on the amount of lump sum payable. But that limit applies individually to each personal pension arrangement. It is, therefore, theoretically possible, as many hon. Members said last year, to have a number of lump sums through personal pension arrangements with different providers, which may come to more than £150,000. But if the £150,000 ceiling were to be applied to all arrangements in aggregate, it could not be enforced effectively in practice.<br><br>
The problem was that a monetary limit on total benefits did not fit well with the contribution controls that apply to personal pensions. But personal pensions are now to be subject to a monetary limit on contributions. That means that the £150,000 limit can be removed because of the limit on contributions. Personal pensions are money purchase schemes in which one's returns depend on the success of one's investment. In future, people on high incomes will have limited scope to pay large amounts into personal pension schemes. That contribution control, with a general restriction of lump sum payments to 25 per cent., becomes more effective. When that was raised

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Coombs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a probing amendment, but a further extension of the opportunities for those over 61 to add to their personal pension schemes on a tax allowable basis, and it is therefore additional to the constructive amendments to section 640 of the Taxes Act 1988. Everyone welcomes the steps taken in recent years to increase opportunity for people to make personal provision for their retirement through occupational pensions and new personal pensions, which last year effectively replaced retirement annuities.<br><br>
There are good reasons for that—not just in terms of quality of life, but in terms of demography. Until the year 2000, the number of over-65s is likely to increase by 1 million, from 9 to 10 million, and the number of over-75s is likely to double to 1.5 million people. The United Kingdom and Germany have the largest number of over-65s as a proportion of the total population in Europe, and the ratio of pensioners to people in the economy who contributed to their pensions will become more adverse over the next 20 to 30 years.<br><br>
Given the large drop in the number of 18 to 25-year-olds in the work force, there will be more job opportunities and demands for elderly people to continue in work. In view of that, it is right to encourage occupational pensions—of which there are about 11 million at present—and to encourage more flexible personal pensions. Since they were introduced in July last year, no fewer than 3 million people have taken advantage of them. However, it is an unfortunate fact that many people do not plan sufficiently early for their retirement. That does not matter so much if they have an occupational pension. Even if they do not pay their contributions before the age of 45, a helpful employer can make up through his own funds the funds in the pension plan, so that people can effectively take advantage of a full two thirds of their final salary on retiring.<br><br>
Some people rely on personal pensions because they opted out of an unsatisfactory occupational pension scheme, changed jobs in later life, and perhaps never had the opportunity to get into a job with an occupational pension scheme; or they started

their own business at the age of 40, spent 10 years building it up and only from the age of 50 had sufficient funds to think about improving their pension facilities. There is still a gulf between those who rely on the benefits afforded by personal pension schemes and those who rely on the benefits available through good occupational pension schemes.<br><br>
It may not be possible to guarantee total uniformity between those two types of pension provision, but the provisions in schedule 7 go some way to improving uniformity of opportunity as between good occupational schemes and personal pension plans. My amendment provides a further extension for people over the age of 61 who, for at least the last five years of their working life, would be able to provide a further 5 per cent. of their income on a tax allowable basis towards their personal pensions. The measure has been welcomed by Scottish Widows' Fund and Life Assurance Society, Legal and General, most of the pensions' industry and, more significantly, by Help the Aged and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) said, personal pensions have been remarkably successful during their first year in the pensions market.<br><br>
My hon. Friend pointed out that the new maximum contribution rates announced in the Budget reach their highest level at an earlier age than before—that is, at 56 instead of 61. There were good reasons for proposing that change. In particular it allows people a longer period to contribute at the highest possible level. That obviously increases the likelihood of personal pension members being able to match the benefits they might have received as members of good occupational schemes.<br><br>
My hon. Friend pointed out that some people who change jobs late in career, with inadequate pensions and who have not given much thought to them, could benefit from a re-instatement of a further maximum contribution limit for those aged 61 or more. My hon. Friend's proposal to introduce a new maximum rate of 40 per cent. is the right way to achieve that. It would not add to the cost of the personal pension tax reliefs. Therefore I am happy to commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Over the years we have debated numerous amendments about tax reliefs being restricted to the basic rate. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) has moved several amendments to that effect. It is unusual to find the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) in alliance with the Democrats. We have always made the point that with a progressive tax system it is right that tax relief should apply to all the rates throughout the system. It is a simple point of principle that we have debated in relation to numerous reliefs including mortgage relief.<br><br>
The amendment is odd because it would restrict reliefs to the basic rate for personal pensions only and not for occupational pensions. I do not know whether that was intended, but on reflection the hon. Gentleman might feel that it would be wrong to disadvantage one arm of pensions provision, namely personal pensions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not striking that when tax reliefs are approved of by the Government, they are rights that should be extended through the higher rates of tax as part of a progressive tax system, and when the Government do not like tax reliefs they are a public subsidy to a particular group of taxpayers that should be restricted or removed?</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new tax regime for certified unit trusts introduced by clause 75 provides for payments to corporate unit holders to be treated as annual payments that have borne tax at the basic rate of income tax rather than dividend income.<br><br>
This rule was introduced to prevent companies subject to corporation tax at 35 per cent. avoiding tax by channelling some types of investments through unit trusts where they would bear tax at only 25 per cent. The rule does, however, impose a penalty on corporate investors in unit trusts that are invested in equities. It means that companies would have to pay an extra 10 per cent. tax on income which the unit trust received as franked investment income, when that income is passed on to them.<br><br>
There are two cases where we think it would not be right to impose this additional corporation tax liability. The first is funds of funds, which are unit trusts whose sole object is to invest in other unit trusts. They are treated as companies for tax purposes, but they are not certified unit trusts within clause 75. That is because they do not come within the UCITS directive. They are, however, mainly invested in unit trusts that are certified unit trusts. The second case is unit trust management companies, which receive income from trusts as a result of their dealings in units.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
The amendments will disapply the rule and, therefore, allow distributions from certified unit trusts to continue to be received as dividend income by funds of funds and unit trust managers in the ordinary course of their business. The related new clause 20 will ensure that distributions from funds of funds to companies are treated in the same way as those from certified unit trusts. That is to prevent the relaxation for funds of funds being used to recreate the avoidance possibilities that the original rule was designed to stop. A similar safeguard is not needed in the case of unit trust managers because of the limited range of activities in which they can engage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been representations to members of the Committee about funds of funds and money market trusts. Will the Minister clarify whether, under the Government's amendments, the funds of funds in ordinary use by normal unit trust investors, which are recommended to them as a means of achieving a broad spread at an early stage of investment, will be adversely placed in relation to other unit trusts? What will be the position on the apparent discrimination against money market trusts? Those making the representations have suggested that this is a means to channel small-savings investment towards the financing of companies and industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have similar concerns to those of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). New clause 20 places funds of funds in the same, or at least a similar, position to that of ordinary funds covered by clause 75 as it stands. I hope that the Government will clarify that, but we are grateful for the clarification that they have given of the purpose of the amendments and the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, I think that the Committee has missed the main point, which is that the Government should be congratulated on listening to the representations that they have received over the past year from unit trust groups. It is important that nothing in the tax regime that applies to unit trusts in this country will place them at a disadvantage when competing in the European single market after the regulations are relaxed at the end of this year by agreement with our community partners. There will be cross-marketing of unit trusts across the Community. It is important that the British financial services industry is in no way disadvantaged against its competitors. That is the essential point in the concession that the Government have made in the clause.<br><br>
Although I do not speak for any special lobby, I am a director of Dewe Rogerson International, which has some unit trust groups among its clients. I am also a consultant to my former firm Morgan Grenfell, which has unit trust activities. I do not speak under instructions from those companies or their clients. Although they may welcome the Government's move, it is unlikely that the clients of the firms will be pleased by the remainder of what I have to say about the clause.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
The Government's decision to introduce clause 75 may be positive, but on some of the details they may have listened to the wrong representations. Two categories of non-equity funds were not covered by the UCITS directives, one of which—funds of funds—has now been given equivalent tax privileges, while the other—money market funds—has not been given equivalent tax privileges.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
We should consider all prospective tax concessions in terms of their economic impact on particular activities and of the public interest and general public equity. Funds of funds are a bad cause and should not be promoted by any tax concessions. They are a transparent marketing ploy, enabling unit trust managers to increase their commissions from managing unit trusts. The trick is to charge the client a percentage—typically 1 per cent. per annum—for investing in individual unit trusts, and then to charge him an additional override commission when he invests in a fund of funds.<br><br>
That doubling-up process is highly undesirable for the small investor, whose interests we should have at heart. It represents an abdication of responsibility by the unit trust manager. He should be offering a series of funds, some of which are specialised, such as Japanese, growth or special situation funds, and some of which are general managed funds suitable for people wishing to put their personal pension into a fund that they will not follow closely over the 10, 20, 30 or however many years elapse between taking out the policy and collecting the pension.<br><br>
This concession means that, more and more often, unit trust fund managers will say to the small investor, "We have all these wonderful funds, including the so-called general managed funds suitable for people in your situation. We can put you into a fund of funds, so you can have a bit of all of them." The manager will then charge the investor an even higher commission. That is disingenuous and undesirable. I am sorry that we should be extending to funds of funds the fiscal concessions, which, in other respects, I welcome on behalf of the unit trust movement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little unclear as to what the hon. Gentleman is objecting to about funds of funds. Is it the level of commission charged, or the spreading of risk? While one may be reprehensible, the other is to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am objecting to the concept of doubling up commission. It is a sleight of hand that was used, to give an extreme example, by Bernie Cornfield in a notorious financial scandal 15 years ago. One sets up a series of funds, and when, like Bernie Cornfield and I.O.S. one has sufficiently bemused the client with the range of funds available, all of which have different investment criteria, one says, "The best thing would be to achieve a diversification between all our different funds, so you should invest in the fund of funds." The investor then pays double commission—he may pay 1 per cent. on the underlying funds and another 0.25 per cent., or 0.5 per cent., on the fund of funds.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
It is disingenuous for a fund manager to do that. He should say to the investor, "We have a general managed fund, a general equity fund, an international equity fund and specialised funds, so you can choose what to do. If you want to put a quarter of your portfolio into Japan, invest in our Japanese equity fund. If you want half of it in fixed interest, put it in our gilt fund or our fixed interest fund."<br><br>
So I regret that the Government are making a concession that puts funds of funds on the same fiscal basis as general equity funds. By contrast, I also regret that the concession has not been extended to money market funds, which seem to be in the public interest. An unfortunate irony of the current financial position—I speak in the interests of the small account investor, not of large financial conglomerates—is that the big investor can gain a wholesale yield on the funds that he invests. He can invest £1 million, £10 million or £50 million with banks or elsewhere at the best market rates. But a small investor with £50, £100 or £500 will find that his bank is unwilling to give him the same rates.<br><br>
By purchasing money market funds, small investors can benefit from investing at the wholesale, high rate of interest, minus the commission. In the public interest, we should not disadvantage money market funds.<br><br>
Although I welcome the broad thrust of the clause—it is essential if our unit and investment trust industries are to compete in the single market on equal terms—I wonder whether we have got the emphasis the wrong way round. If an opportunity arises in future, I hope that the Government will be a little nicer to money market funds and a little more sceptical about funds of funds. In that way, they may get it 100 per cent. right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) for putting the changes in the wider context of the usage directive and the opening up of the European market. As he said, the changes will ensure that unit trusts that are marketable in Europe and have income from fixed interest securities are not disadvantaged by the tax charge. We were convinced that there was a strong case for that.<br><br>
This is an evolving scene, and we shall examine the taxation of collective investment vehicles for the future in the context of the European market. I am not committing myself to anything, but I am aware that we risk driving some of the unit trust industry offshore, to operate where the tax regime seems more transparent or attractive. However, we are convinced that the aspect of unit trusts with a degree of bond income should not be disadvantaged, and we shall consider other aspects of the tax system as it applies to collective investment vehicles and their being marketed in Europe.<br><br>
My reply to the hon. Members for Berwick-upon-Tweed and for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is that we have met their points. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding criticised funds of funds, and I have heard many people do the same. My hon. Friend was talking about the structuring of the funds and the multiple
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
commissions. The Government do not have a view on funds of funds; we are neither commending them nor criticising them. There may be issues for the regulators, but the correct position for us to adopt on the tax system is to ensure that funds of funds that are investing in UCITS of the kind from which we seek to remove a tax disadvantage under these changes are not particularly disadvantaged. I make no comment on the points raised by my hon. Friend, but all we are doing is ensuring that the tax system does not discriminate against them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that, and I accept my right hon. Friend's point that whether anything should be done to discourage or encourage funds of funds is a regulatory question. Anything that is done should ideally be done on a Community basis for reasons that I have already mentioned. Will my right hon. Friend give further throught between now and the next Finance Bill to whether there might be an advantage in granting to money market funds the fiscal concessions made for the other UCITS funds under this clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we shall consider the taxation of collective investment vehicles. However, I was going to say something about money market funds anyway. Money market funds are not UCITS under the terms of the directive, and they are not freely marketable in Europe. They would be penalised by a switch into the corporation tax regime for other authorised unit trusts. That is because they would have to pay tax at 35 per cent. since they would not get the lower tax rate that applies to UCITS. They are at present taxed at a rate of 25 per cent., so that is why we intended that those trusts should remain within the income tax regime with no change to their tax position.<br><br>
It would not have been right to have changed it in the way that my hon. Friend has suggested. However, I assure him that I have had many discussions with the unit trust industry about the matter, and we are aware of the need to look at the quickly changing collective investment scene in a European context, and that we shall do.</span></p>

the Government's principal purpose appears to be to ensure that the United Kingdom unit trust industry is not placed at a disadvantage when the UCITS directive comes into operation and that it can confidently compete with continental competitors. The Government seem to be achieving that by changing the present system under which, as far as I can tell, most unit trusts pay tax at the main rate of corporation tax—35 per cent.—but receive tax relief on management expenses and interest paid.<br><br>
Some unit trusts operate a different system under which they pay tax at the basic rate of income tax at 25 per cent. but get no relief on management expenses. In clause 75 the Government seek to resolve that position into one in which all such trusts that come under the UCITS directive, and now also the funds of funds, will pay tax at the basic rate of income tax and will also be able to claim relief on management expenses.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
None of us could object to the principle of what the Government are trying to achieve—fair competition and a fair wind for competition for the United Kingdom unit trust industry, but I have one or two points of detail that I should like clarified.<br><br>
First, the Government estimate in the Red Book that the cost of changes to the unit trust tax regime will be negligible. Is that so, because for some unit trusts the change will be a major change in the tax regime? It would be useful to get more from the Government than the small star that appears in the relevant column in the Red Book. Can the Government give an estimate of the cost of the changes to the Exchequer?<br><br>
Secondly, I do not know why the Government have chosen 1 January as the operative date for the new regime rather than the date of the coming into effect of the UCITS directive, which is three months earlier. There may be administrative reasons for that, but it is odd that when the basic principle is to put the United Kingdom industry on a footing with that of Europe, the dates should differ between the two decisions.<br><br>
Thirdly, it would be helpful to know whether relief for management expenses exists in the tax regimes of our European competitors. I entirely understand that the tax regime at the basic rate may be the principle to establish in comparison with our competitors, but I should be grateful for confirmation from the Government that relief for management expenses exists in competitor countries.<br><br>
Finally, I am unsure why the Government have chosen to tie the tax to the basic rate of income tax at the same time as they are advancing the purpose of comparison with other EEC countries. Our basic rate of income tax is higher than the starting rates of tax in most EEC countries. Does that difference mean that our unit trust industry will still be at a disadvantage because of our relatively higher starting rate of income tax than that in other EEC countries?<br><br>
It would be useful to have guidance and clarification on those points of detail, but we do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
not object to the principle of a competitive United Kingdom unit trust industry that can take advantage of the removal of barriers in October this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall answer the points raised by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the cost in Red Book terms is negligible, at under £3 million, but in a full year it will be about £20 million. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether relief for management expenses existed elsewhere in Europe. I am told that the answer is yes, but I shall decline to comment in detail on his points about tax regimes that apply elsewhere in Europe. I had some conversations with the unit trust industry about that, and find it difficult meaningfully to compare the tax regimes applied to investment vehicles in different European countries without considering a broad range of taxation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will be surprised that we have chosen the start date to accord with the start date for the new life assurance regime. Aligning the dates avoids the need for administering costly transitional provisions that would otherwise be necessary to avoid a tax penalty on life funds invested in unit trusts. The hon. Gentleman knows that the life assurance industry is a major investor in unit trusts.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked about the rate. Before the Budget, a trust investing in some types of assets, in particular in bonds, could pay tax of 35 per cent. of the income from those assets but could only pass on a credit to the investor of 25 per cent. The change will ensure that the tax rate in trust is the same as the rate for which the investor can get credit.</span></p>

GILT UNIT TRUSTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 55, line 40, leave out "an authorised" and insert "a certified".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 306 and 308.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with gilt unit trusts, which have been excluded since 1980 from the corporation tax rules for taxing the income of authorised unit trusts. That was to enable them to invest in United Kingdom interest-bearing securities without suffering a tax penalty as compared with a direct investor. The exclusion allowed gilt unit trusts to pay tax on their income at income tax rates—at present 25 per cent.—rather than at corporation tax rates—at present 35 per cent. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury may be interested that it denied giving them that lower rate and also denied gilt unit trusts relief for management expenses and interest payments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
The UCITS directive covers the vast majority of authorised unit trusts, including gilt unit trusts. Now that the directive is being introduced, and a lower rate of corporation tax provided for United Kingdom unit trusts that fall within the UCITS definition there is no longer any reason for taxing gilt unit trusts that are UCITS differently from other authorised unit trusts. Putting them in the same regime as authorised unit trusts means that they will pay the same tax at the same rate as hitherto—albeit corporation tax rather than income tax—and they will become eligible for relief for management expenses and interest paid on borrowing within Securities and Investments Board regulations. That should enable gilt unit trusts to compete in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary explained clearly why clause 76 should stand part of the Bill, and we do not disagree with him. We certainly want gilt unit trusts to be dealt with in precisely the same way as other unit trusts.<br><br>
However, I have a minor, technical question about amendment No. 308. It deletes subsection (4) in clause 76, which defines "authorised unit trust" and "distribution period" and inserts a new definition of "certified unit trust" with the inelegant qualification
<br><blockquote><p>"as respects a distribution period".</p></blockquote>
That is infelicitous language which may benefit from tidying up, if only in the cause of elegance and grace. However, a more important potential problem is whether the words "certified unit trusts" in respect of anything other than the distribution period have not been defined in relation to the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot reply off the cuff, but I shall look into it and write to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(4) For the purposes of this section 'certified unit trust' means, as respects a distribution period, a unit trust scheme in the case of which—

<li>an order under section 78 of the Financial Services Act 1986 is in force during the whole or part of the accounting period in which the distribution period falls, and</li>

<ul>
<li>'distribution period' has the same meaning as in section 468 of the Taxes Act 1988.</li>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to us that this is primarily an anti-avoidance provision, so we warmly welcome it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to remove a tax advantage enjoyed by offshore funds compared with UK unit trusts. It raises the issue of the competitiveness of our unit trust industry and whether it has advantages offshore as opposed to onshore.<br><br>
Currently, there is a tax charge on UK investors on gains made on switching between different parts of a UK unit trust, but there is no corresponding charge for switches within offshore umbrella funds. That is because the latter come within the share reorganisation provisions that defer any charge for CGT purposes.<br><br>
With the increased use of such funds, and the UK market being opened to certain investment vehicles within the EC, the Government think that it is right that onshore and offshore funds should compete on equal terms.</span></p>
