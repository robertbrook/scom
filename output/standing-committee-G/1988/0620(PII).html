	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on the next clauses on the hymn sheet, I should say that representations have been made, asking me to allow a selection of new clauses to be debated after the clauses on the amendment paper. Having consulted both Government and Opposition Front Benches, I am happy to do that for the convenience of the Committee. That means we shall take new clause 9, moved by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), and new clauses 10, 21, 22, 23 and 35 in the name of the Financial Secretary. I thank the Committee members who assisted with the bush telegraph in getting the message across that we would resume at 9 o'clock. When the sitting was suspended, I had no idea that we would be faced with four Divisions on the trot, rather than two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), who moved amendment No. 476, referred to retrospection. Obviously there is retrospection in the sense that the new formula will apply to open charges, as already happens when rates are changed. Interest rates apply to all open charges and when rates are changed, the new rates apply from that day on, and across the board, to all open charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the day on which the new procedures come into effect, there will inevitably be a large number of tax charges in respect of which payment has not finally been made. Some will remain open for a considerable period after that, for instance awaiting the determination of an appeal or a valuation of a property—inheritance tax, in particular, can take a considerable period to determine. Changes to interest rates made after the new procedures come into effect ought to apply both to new charges, made after the new procedures come into effect, and to existing charges, made before the new procedures came into effect, which are still open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing sinister about that. If there were an adjustment in interest rates under the existing system, that would happen anyway. But not to do that would be unfair in relation to new open charges and existing open charges, apart from the fact that the Revenue could not operate different rates of interest in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the Financial Secretary's assurance that there is nothing sinister about the clause. In view of his explanation, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
explanation that he gave for the previous set of amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 485, in page 139, line 43, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and must require an annual statement to be made to the House of Commons setting out the effects of the Regulations over the preceding year, a comparison of each interest rate with market interest rates, and explanations as to the reasons for the level of the interest rates adopted".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 488, in page 139, line 45, leave out "annulment in pursuance of a" and insert "affirmative".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with the manner in which the statutory instrument setting out the principles on which interest rate changes can be made could be considered by the House of Commons. The Opposition have no objection to the Treasury and the Inland Revenue ensuring that proper and realistic rates of interest are charged. Indeed, at a time when interest rates go up with punishing regularity as a result of the failure of the Government's economic policies, we do not wish the Exchequer to be defrauded of proper, due revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no objection to the principle that the Government are enshrining in the clause, but there should be proper parliamentary scrutiny of the detailed regulations when they are laid before the House. It is important that we know the relationship to base rate that is included, the way in which different interest rates are envisaged, the different classes of back-payment required, and so on. Those are important matters, which should come automatically before the House for consideration, rather than requiring the usual eagle-eyed Opposition attention before a debate can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I replied to that briefly when the hon. Member for Wrexhm (Dr. Marek) referred to the matter in moving Amendment No. 475. I explained that the affirmative procedure is usually adopted only when it would be appropriate for Parliament to scrutinise the use of the regulation-making power. I gave as an example the use of the regulator, and maintained that it was appropriate to use the less cumbersome negative resolution procedure elsewhere. It is the usual practice of the House to use the negative procedure for administrative regulations. As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) knows, the negative resolution does not deny Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attached to the amendment is the idea of an annual report setting out the interest rates that have been used and comparing them with market rates. I have explained that the rates will be determined by a formula and I gave as an example 2½ per cent. plus base, but with adjustment made for the tax treatment of the interest. That formula will be laid before Parliament. The system will be transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
This is not a great point of principle. I do not see a case for laying a report before Parliament about the simple arithmetical exercise involved in calculating the interest rates. It would not make the most exciting bedtime reading, and the expense would be extremely difficult to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires changes to interest rates to be made by order of the Board of Inland Revenue, so changes would be publicised. This will be a more transparent system. I have explained how the formula might work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though Opposition Members are rightly jealous of the need for Parliament to keep watch on the Executive, we should not be enhancing the scrutiny of the Executive significantly in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parliament is always keen to ensure that the Executive—especially this Executive—get away with as little as possible. However, in this respect the Financial Secretary may have a point. A report to Parliament each year would, none the less, serve as a useful reminder of the movement of interest rates during the year. The one for the past 12 months would make extremely interesting reading. However, there is little difference between the two sides of the Committee on the principle at stake in the clause and it is not a point on which it is worth going to the wall. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 170 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clauses 171 and 172 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 173</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>BROADCASTING: ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY PROGRAMME CONTRACTORS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 173 brings into force schedule 16. I have some more detailed points to make about the schedule, which we can perhaps discuss when we debate it. However, it would be useful to use this clause stand part debate to discuss the principles underlying the change that the Government seek to make to the levy on independent television contractors. I should perhaps remind the Committee, as I usually do when I speak on broadcasting matters, that I have a close association with the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians, the film technicians' trade union, which makes an annual payment to my constituency Labour party. However, the principles at stake are of much more general importance than that. It is in the interests of programme consumers—the viewers at home—that I wish to express concern about what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
The change that the Government are introducing will ensure that from 1990 the ITV levy is in two parts. There will be a levy on net advertising revenue of 10 per cent. and a levy on domestic profits of 25 per cent. Both those levies will allow a free slice of income, not subject to the levy, of £15 million on revenue plus the equivalent of the fourth channel subscription and a free slice of £2 million on profits. The levy on profits will be assessed after allowing for payment of the revenue levy. There will be no levy on profits from overseas sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levy has had a chequered history in the past few years. It has been subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It has also been subject to scrutiny on a number of occasions by the Public Accounts Committee. I suspect that part of the reason for the Government's action in the clause and the attached schedule is their desire to take account of the PAC's criticisms. The Government appear to be trying to do things through the changes. First, they want to encourage what the Comptroller and Auditor General described as cost-consciousness and programming efficiency. I shall return to that issue in a moment. The Government are shifting the burden of the levy from profits, where it rests entirely at the moment to advertising revenue and profits, with a much lower take on profits than there is now. The idea that appears to lie behind what the Government are doing is that it will encourage cost-consciousness among the programmers and the indepent television stations. That seems to be the first reason for the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason appears to lie in the original purpose of the levy, which was to recompense the Exchequer for the monopolitistic position of the ITV channels. It has traditionally been thought that a contribution to the nation, for the use of national assets of television frequencies and stations, should be made by the monopoly producers and suppliers in the industry. Again, I shall return to that because changes are occuring in television and it is important to realise that the justification for that aspect of the levy is diminishing over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason for the Government's changes appears to be to make up for lost revenue. That is the point that the Public Accounts Committee was after in its recent reports. It judged that there was approximately a £19 million loss in each of the past two financial years on the previous method of calculating the levy as a result of the current calculation. The Government say that their change would restore the previous position, so that the lost revenue to which the Public Accounts Committee drew attention would be recouped for the Exchequer. However, there is a slight problem. It seems that the new system that the Treasury hopes to introduce will bring in considerably more income than just making good the shortfall would do. Once again, I shall return to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal is to move to a levy on net advertising revenue coupled with a levy on profits. Of course, things will change again in 1992. We are talking of a period between 1990 and 1992 to which the change will apply. It is a little difficult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
to understand exactly what the Government will do in 1992. At that time, if the Government have their way—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkaldy (Dr. Moonie) rightly says that by the time that we reach 1992, there will undoubtedly have been a change of Government so perhaps we should be talking—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appeal to hon. Members. It is a little difficult for me to hear what is being said because there are so many conversations taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So perhaps we should be talking not about what the Government will do, but much more about what they propose to do in 1992, although I hope that they will not have that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their proposals for broadcasting and the franchising of the ITV stations, the Government are unclear about the future of the levy in the new franchising system that they propose to operate. As Members will know, the Home Secretary proposes that, effectively, post-1992, the ITV channels should be up for auction to the highest bidder. He says that stations will have to cross a quality threshold and deposit a bond, but at heart the price mechanism will determine who gets the ITV stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposals that the Home Secretary announced to the House only last week, after 1992 the bid for the franchise will apparently be an offer of a percentage of advertising revenue. It appears that between 1990 and 1992 the Government will place the bulk of the importance on advertising revenue with a bit on profits but that, from 1992, they will move towards a system that depends on a share of advertising revenue as part of the bid that a station makes when it seeks a franchise. We are discussing a change that will apply for two years, and for two years only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisagee considerable problems as a result of the proposals. Problem No. one is that the Home Office press release issued on Budget day estimates that the new levy from 1990 will raise about £40 million a year more than the present levying system. I do not want to beef about extra income to the Exchequer, but £40 million seems considerably greater than the shortfall of £19 million that the Public Accounts Committee identified in its report for the past two financial years. It appears that the Exchequer is seeking to take an even greater slice of income from television stations than it would if it were simply restoring the old system. The extra income will have to come from somewhere, and my suspicion is that it will come from programme quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problem No. two relates to programme quality. The proposed additional imposition on ITV companies will inevitably place downward pressure on programme budgets and, in the long run, on programme quality. ITV stations will be urged at every fiscal corner to cut costs in order to minimise the tax burden imposed by the levy. They will always find it more tempting to buy cheap programmes from overseas rather than to take the expensive step of making their own programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
The best quality programmes on British television are traditionally made by British-based television companies or independent producers. They cost more than programmes bought off the shelf, which will be a profound disincentive to programme quality under the proposals, when cost will be much more the name of the game than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable response to the Government's proposals from the television industry. The chairman of the Independent Television Association said of the Government's levy proposal:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Exchequer will benefit at the expense of viewers as programme expenditure will have to be cut."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the problem. Downward pressure on programme quality and the fact that there will be no investment offset available against the levy payment will inevitably lead to a decline in standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problem No. three is that the benefit for overseas sales, which appears to be built into the new system, will prove illusory in the long run. Overseas sales will be possible only if we have quality programmes to sell. As the downward pressure on cost, budgets and quality begins to bite over the two-year period, the availability of income from overseas sales will tend to diminish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to problem No. four. Inevitably, some costs will be passed on to advertisers, and although the Government expects that the bulk of income under the new levy system will come from within the programme stations, I suspect that some of the costs will be passed on to the advertising agencies and companies. That, in turn, will tend to lead to a diminution of the overall pool of advertising expenditure and material. It is happening at a time when there are growing organs of competition within the media for advertising revenue, and if at the same time the cost of advertising is increased as a result of the levy, the question arises of whether there will be sufficiently keen advertisers to take up the spaces available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problem No. five: the extra costs will hit television stations differently. Television companies that have high profits but relatively low advertising budgets will do comparatively better than the larger television stations with large advertising budgets. The most obvious example of a company that will gain under the Government's proposed system is TV-am, but other television companies will suffer. Mr. Akers, the media analyst at Citycorp, estimates that Central television will pay about £25.5 million in the new levy in 1990, compared with just over £12 million in the past. He also estimates that LWT, Thames and Yorkshire will pay between 40 per cent. and 45 per cent. more than they are paying at present, and that Harlech television's bill will increase by 72 per cent. So the Government are introducing substantial increases in the amount that they are demanding from independent television companies. It is a near doubling of the amount for Central, almost a 50 per cent. increase in the LWT, Thames and Yorkshire contributions, and a three quarters increase in HTV's contribution. It is quite likely, at the same time, that TV-am's contribution will fall. There seems to be little logic or justice in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
Problem No. six: it seems odd that the Government are planning major disruption of the levy system just two years before changes in the franchising are to be introduced. It strikes us as odd that such enormous changes in payments made by television companies should be introduced at a time when the future of those companies is made so uncertain by the changes that the Government suggested in their broadcasting White Paper, to be introduced in their Bill next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if a television station owns an advertising agency—or vice versa—and especially if part of the proposals spills over into the years after 1992? Under paragraph 1(5) of schedule 16, in line 16 of page 233, it seems that it would be possible for a television station and an advertising agency to agree the price for advertising at a rate that would diminish the amount payable to the Exchequer under the levy. The Government do not appear to have foreseen that problem. The case may be hypothetical, but it suggests a possible route for tax avoidance for a television station and advertising agency bright enough to spot it. The Bill gives little protection against a shifting around of rates and charges to achieve such a saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, therefore, many doubts about the wisdom of the changes that the Government propose. We accept that the arguments of the Comptroller and Auditor General and of the Public Accounts Committee ought to be noted, but the Government are apparently going far further and bringing in changes that will take a great deal of money out of the independent television companies, at the expense of programme-making, investment and programme quality. Ultimately, that will be to the detriment of millions of viewers. I am sure that the Government do not intend that, and that the people do not want it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to talk briefly of the way in which the Bill adds to the anxieties of an industry that is already uncertain of its future role in a world increasingly dominated by trans-national broadcasting via satellite and cable. The industry has already seen considerable cuts in the staffing of studios and in camera crews. It has seen large investment in high technology, video technology and broadcasting systems. The television industry has been trying to gird its loins in preparation for the invasion from space—as the advent of trans-national broadcasting has been called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and honourable Members will recall how painful some staff rationalisations have been; they will remember seeing Anne Diamond's cherubic face disappearing out of left frame as some refugee from TV-am's boardroom confused his camera controls with his elbow. The rationalisations have been part of an overall attempt by British television producers to cut costs—the prime purpose of clause 173. Unfortunately, until now that has been done in time-honoured British fashion, not by slicing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
inflated salaries of the boardroom members and their star presenters, but by limiting the resources and staff available for the excellent productions that have won this country a reputation as the home of some of the best television in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that clause 173 and schedule 16 could encourage this process, when our television producers should be urged to perpetuate and extend these excellent achievements. That is the only way for British television to survive as a major and innovative force in competition with producers, mostly based in America, who can lavish funds on programmes, features and series in the certain knowledge that they have a virtually guaranteed market in the English-speaking—or American-speaking—world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that profits from overseas sales of programmes will be tax free, which I welcome. However, the battleground will know no borders. There will be no convenient demarcation line when satellite broadcasting comes to maturity, beyond the youthful and largely invisible antics of Sky television. It will be extremely competitive; a vital component in any company's armoury will be the possession of a significant slice of the home market. Without revenue accruing from that home market, production companies will not have the finance or the confidence to fund projects that can compete in excellence with America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there will always be exceptions. Some companies will count on the continuing success of tried and tested formulae. Doubtless, "Neighbours" and the like will weave their tedious spell on audiences well into the 1990s, despite being produced by a nation whose home television market is modest in size. Television companies and indpendent producers in this country will survive, even flourish, depsite legislation such as this. But that should not be the aim of legislation. We should be encouraging a most innovative and important industry to specialise in doing what it does best. Concentrating its strengths to compete in the expanding world market.

Television is an industry that we do not fully understand. For example, in south Wales more people are employed in making film and television programmes than in mining coal. We are being flippant in our dealings with the television industry. I am also worried that we talk about ITV as if it were a static organisation which will always exist. What will happen after the liberalisation of the market to the independent producers, many of whom are already in place? Will they also come under the umbrella of the Bill? The Bill states that the ITV payment to support Channel 4 will be tax free. What about the ITV payment to support S4C? What can we do to enourage the growth of independent producers? What tax concessions will they get?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am uneasy about the clause. We have to be careful. Such is the industry's state of flux that we could be dealing it a severe blow. It may not be a death blow, but it could limit horizons instead of expanding them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with great reluctance that I come to the defence of the ITV companies, because I have worked for two of them. But when examining the issue, the Committee should take a slightly relaxed view of some of the management comments on programme quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that when I first started in television, I discussed with a shop steward the companies' professed interest in, and concern about, programme quality. He gave me a jaundiced look and said, "If they could run a blank screen between the ads and just clear the profits, they would." I thought him hard and cynical, but he was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the quality of ITV managements, I remember the time at TV-am when there had just been a handover of management. The Famous Five had gone, and with them Peter Jay, who had been chief executive and chairman. I was sitting at my word processor as a humble journalist when Richard Marsh, the new chairman, walked past my desk and began talking to me. It was a very small company and members of the board talked to ordinary journalists. Richard Marsh said, "It's a funny thing about Peter Jay. We"—meaning members of the Board—"knew that he knew nothing about business but thought that he knew everything about television." I said, "Funny you should say that. The journalists knew that he knew nothing about television but thought that he knew everything about business." That illustrates the quality of ITV managements. Having worked for TV-am—the first example in history of a sinking ship being saved by a rat—and having been there when the London Electricity Board came to turn off the electricity because the bill had not been paid, I can listen to only so much about the quality of independent television and its managements' concern for programme quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, we have to consider seriously proposals to increase the levy. I believe that they are based on the Government's political misunderstanding of the nature of ITV, of its labour practices and of the profits with which it is awash. The Government were so obsessed with labour practices in ITV that they went to the length of commissioning a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report, which they hoped would find scarifying examples of Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians members, and members of the National Union of Journalists, taking home millions of pounds from Spanish practices. The MMC gave the ITV unions a clean bill of health. So much for what the Government know about independent television. On the basis of that lack of knowledge, they have decided to introduce this punitive tax levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the money to pay the new increased levy will come from programmes and that, in as much as the managements of ITV companies have a commitment to programme quality, it will be harder to fulfil with less money. Just as the the MMC investigation was based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the ITV companies' unions, so the clause is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of ITV and the profits washing around. We should consider the clause in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) gave a lucid analysis of the clause's purpose and the different concept behind the new basis of the levy as opposed to the profit-based levy of the past. The hon. Gentleman may know that the previous levy was geared more to net advertising revenue, but as he said, in the recent past the levy's present basis of profit was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee both in terms of the revenue that it raised and because of the absence of an incentive to efficiency. That has been frequently debated and we recognise the good reasons why a levy that is based on profit would not give as strong an incentive as one based on net advertising revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned a number of announcements that my right honourable Friend the Home Secretary made recently. My right honourable Friend said that the levy would be abolished after December 1992. Following the introducton of competitive tendering for the Channel 3 contracts, the annual sum paid by successful bidders would include a predetermined element based on advertising revenue. If the hon. Gentleman examines what my right honourable Friend the Home Secretary said, he will see that there is a net advertising element and a lump sum element. That will apply only from 1933, so we are discussing an interim arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little surprised by the argument of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Frinsbury, which he did not advance with much scepticism. We heard loud and clear the voice of the ITV companies. The hon. Gentleman wondered how we dared to increase the levy by so much. He queried our figure of £40 million, compared with the figure of £19 million or £16 million to which the Public Accounts Committee referred. However, the increase takes into account adjustment through time. Taking account of the growth in profits of the companies, ours is the same sort of figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that, in recent years, ITV companies' post-tax profits have more than doubled from £84 million in 1985 to about £175 million, due to a rapid growth in revenue. Our proposals are expected to increase the levy yield by about £40 million a year, but that will still leave the ITV companies with substantially more to spend on programmes than they had a few years ago. I forget which analyst the hon. Gentleman quoted, but the announcements about the levy have not had too big an impact on the share price of ITV companies. The stock market does not seem to take as fearful a view about the future of the companies as the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury had advanced his criticisms of the proposal with a little more scepticism, I would have said that, of course, we shall keep the matter under review and that if net advertising revenue does not rise as we expect it to rise, we shall consider whether changes to the levy are needed. But based on recent events and on the increased profits of the ITV companies—an average growth in advertising revenue of 9 per cent. a year in real terms between 1983 and 1988—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
we are eminently justified in our response to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and in introducing changes to the levy that will bring about the yield that the Public Accounts Committee considered appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of advertising revenue, we shall keep the issue under review. I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that the rationale for the levy has become weaker. Obviously, the monopoly rent element is much less because of the opening up of television to satellite. That is why my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced that, in the new world, the levy would be replaced by competitive tendering, which would include a predetermined element based on advertising revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This must be a matter of judgment, but the profits show that the companies can afford to pay the levy. The figure of £40 million that the hon. Gentleman queried is merely the equivalent of the sum of £19 million in 1986. Understandably, the hon. Gentleman referred to the levy's effect on programme standards. However, the profit figures of the companies show that, even after the increase in the levy, that they will have more to spend on programmes than they have had in the past. But the appropriate tax rate that they can bear must be a matter of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked about the possibility of television stations and advertising agents collusively rigging the levy. The Bill provides for the IBA to substitute a reasonable figure of 15 per cent. as commission to an advertising agency—that is on page 233, subsection (6)—and it is intended to eliminate the possibility to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman also quoted figures for individual companies and spoke about the effects of the Revenue on them. Of course, he was right to say that the levy will have a differential effect on different companies but we have had to take an overall view. However, the concessions that we made on overseas sales, to which the hon Gentleman referred, were designed to alleviate the burden on certain of those companies. Some are affected more than others but we had to take a broad view and operate by what we saw as the average in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals that we put forward were modified in the light of representations from the industry and I believe that the current profitability of the industry can bear this increase in the levy. I do not believe that it will affect programme standards but, of course, we will keep an eye on the effects of advertising revenue, and we will move into a different world after 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by the Financial Secretary's arguments, despite the eloquent way in which he expressed them. First, he said that the position will be kept under review, but that is not a useful commitment because we are setting in place a levy mechanism that will apply for two years only from 1990 to 1992. I suspect that any hope that keeping it under review might bring about subsequent changes is illusory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
Secondly, the Financial Secretary said that the Government were not only responding to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee but were going considerably further. The cash which the Government seek to raise from the ITV companies about 100 per cent. more than the shortfall which the PAC identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Financial Secretary laid great stress on the current profitability of the companies. I do not deny that ITV companies are making susbtantially increased profits, but the logic of that should lead the Government to pay attention to the way in which the levy operates on profits. The Government are moving away from a system based on a levy on profits towards one that is based substantially on a levy on revenue. If profit is the argument that the Government are using, they should use profit, not revenue, as the base for the levy that they propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I cannot accept that programme quality will not suffer, or that the proposal will provide an incentive for efficiency. The present system offers an incentive for expenditure on programme production, especially because of the offset system for money spent on that. To a considerable extent, that ensures the production of good quality programmes. The new system of a revenue-based levy that the Government wish to introduce may well have the opposite effect. We are worried that the new levy will drive down budgets, expenditure on programme production and overtime, thereby reducing programme quality for the viewing public. We remain anxious about that and I shall recommend to my hon. Friends to vote against clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 481, in page 230, line 15, after "profits", insert "and in respect of advertising revenue". The amendment is tabled for one purpose only—to enable us to ask the Government why they seek to treat commercial radio differently from commercial television. What is their reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a radio levy up to 1986. At 40 per cent., the rate was lower, but the levy was significant. I suppose that the real question underlying the amendment is whether we should again have a levy on radio stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levy was dropped in 1986 because it had a depressive effect on revenue and growth. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman follows the media. Indeed, I was beginning to think when we debated ITV that it was a rehash of the debates on the film industry that the hon. Gentleman and I enjoyed. As a keen student of the media—I can think of no other reason why the hon. Gentleman should become the mouthpiece of ITV companies—he will know that one or two local radio stations have recently moved into profit but some are still feeling the effect of past losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Out of their revenue the larger companies pay proportionately higher contributions to the IBA for services. Some will face increased competition from new radio stations, and under the new regime there will be substantial competition from national commercial radio and community radio. Furthermore, competition on advertising revenue—a point that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury made, with which I disagreed but forgot to answer in our last debate—will increase because there is now a greater range of television services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those factors lead us to be cautious about reintroducing a measure that had an adverse effect. Although the amendment would give greater flexibility—the levy could be nil—in reality it would not be appropriate to introduce it at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reply. The matter must be kept under review as commercial radio develops. There is not a 1992 time limit for radio as
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
there is for commercial television, so it will be not only possible, but necessary, to review the procedure. Nevertheless, I was interested to hear what the Government have in mind.

This amendment removes an inconsistency in the treatment of sales to DBS and non-DBS satellite concerns. The Bill, as drafted, would make ITV companies liable for levy on profits from sales of programmes made for DBS contractors, but not for other non-DBS satellite operators, such as Sky. It would clearly be to ITV contractors' advantage to sell original programmes to Sky and thus avoid levy, rather than to BSB and pay levy. That rectifies the imbalance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, under the original proposals DBS contractors would be liable to pay levy on profits from sales of programmes to ITV contractors, while non-DBS satellite operators could not be. That would make it cheaper to purchase programmes from Sky, rather than from BSB. The fact that those are the names of the two companies is irrelevant. The absence of equity in the proposals, as originally drafted is undesirable and we should put all types of operator on an equal footing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to ensure that the privacy of the tax affairs of those people and companies with whom the Inland Revenue has dealings are protected once former Official Secrets Acts go into oblivion. The purpose of the clause seems to be to ensure that that privacy is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have three questions. First, the Institute of Chartered Accountants has drawn attention to the too narrow scope in the privacy provision that the clause introduces. It believes that other personal information, uncovered during an investigation into an individuals' tax affairs, might be up for grabs and not protected by the clause's privacy provisions. I hope that that is not the case and that if the Government agree with the Institute, changes to the clause will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the disclosure of information, made with lawful authority under the provisions of subsections (5) and (6), is a protection for the Revenue. Nonetheless, what happens if the disclosure of information is given with apparent lawful authority, but that information is discovered subsequently to have been given incorrectly? Do individuals have any redress? Who can be called to account in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is no time limit on the clause. It could be argued, especially about the tax affairs of corporations rather than of individuals, that 50 years after the Revenue made a particular tax judgment, an historical researcher might justifiably wish to have access to details that had been available to the Revenue at the time. That will happen rarely, but there is no provision for subsequent historical research at a considerable time distance from the provisions of the clause. It would be useful to know whether the Government have considered that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are three relatively minor questions in relation to the basic principle of the clause, which we support wholeheartedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making clear that the Opposition support the principle of the clause that enables criminal proceedings to be taken against someone disclosing information about an individual's tax affairs. We make the distinction between protecting the privacy of individuals and protecting the secrets of Government. There is no question of the powers in the clause being used to safeguard policy documents or Government information. The clause deals with the privacy of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
We brought forward the clause only because it is right to give such protection to the individual. I am pleased to say that there have been no cases of that sort, and we hope that the powers in the clause will not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) raised three questions. The first was based on the representations of the Institute of Chartered Accountants which argued that there should be an absolute bar on disclosure of information rather than only barring disclosure of information relevant to tax. The Institute argued that if an officer discovered that a taxpayer was keeping a mistress, that should not be relevant to tax, and that the officer should not be permitted to disclose such information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is carefully drawn to cover any information provided for the purposes of tax even though it might not, as disclosed, be relevant to tax. The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of those functions"</p></blockquote>
is meant to ensure that "relevant" has this wider meaning. Thus the address or status of a taxpayer may not on the face of it be relevant to tax, but because it is supplied for tax purposes it is protected. The taxpayer is under no obligation to provide information which is not relevant to tax, even under investigation, so there is a safeguard there. If information of the kind that the Institute of Chartered Accountants feared emerged during an investigation, it would be held for the purposes of tax functions and thus covered by the clause. The advice that I have is that the amendment that the Institute of Chartered Accountants would like is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question that the hon. Gentleman asked was what would happen if, under the part of the Bill that enables disclosure to be made with lawful authority, the information was given with apparent authority that turned out not to be lawful authority. The authority will always be carefully checked to ensure that it is the appropriate and right authority, but the hon. Gentleman has raised a question which I should like to consider further.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question comes to mind concerning clause 175 and the regulations referred to in new subsection (1A), starting at line 20 of page 144. What happens if the Bank of England makes such a transfer and subsequently discovers that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
should not have? Is such a transfer revocable? I suspect that that question will arise only in rare circumstances, but it would be good to know the answer. In other respects, we have no objection to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives the Government the power to introduce regulations. What the regulations permit the Government to do depends on the content of the regulations. Therefore, I find it rather hard to answer the hon. Gentleman's hypothetical question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We deserve better from the Economic Secretary than that. The Government are bringing in the power to make regulations in this clause, but if they are doing that they must have in mind some idea of the sorts of regulations that they intend to introduce. Therefore, perhaps they can tell us whether such regulations will cover the point that we have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not understand the question, any more than I understand the various answers that are being proffered. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman when I have read the text, examined the question, understood it all fully and so am able to respond properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to intrude on that interesting but not very productive exchange. We shall have to return to the matter on Report. I had hoped by the exercise of ingenuity to remind the Minister, when considering the redemption of securities, to take another look at 3½ per cent. war loans. A Government who are repaying so much debt ought by now to be looking for a way of redeeming for the original purchasers a loan which they took out from patriotic motives when it was in the immediate interests of the country that they should provide this help. These people are now quite elderly and could reasonably be repaid when the Government are making a virtue of repaying a large amount of national debt. Clearly it would cost about £2 billion to repay all of it, but I am sure that it would be possible to pay a redemption to the original purchasers after extracting information from the original issue register, or working on a claims basis. While the Government are considering the clause, I hope that they will consider making this payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's views, which are widespread, and I have much sympathy with them at first blush. Like their predecessors, the Government have considered the repayment of war loan and concluded that it would not be correct to redeem it. As he said, full redemption would be very expensive—billions of pounds. Partial redemption would be administratively complex. Computerised records started only in about 1967. Going back further would involve a manual inspection over a period of years to ensure that we were redeeming only those who had made loans continuously throughout that period, which would be very time consuming and difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
It is potentially costly beyond the adminsitrative costs. Were we to make such a repayment, there would be similar demands in respect of other undated stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—and perhaps conclusively—it would be unfair to those who have sold their stock in the light of firm assurances by previous Governments, as well as this Government, that no such redemption would be made. They would feel aggrieved if, having taken the word of successive Governments and sold their stock, others who had not were given a repayment which there was no legal obligation to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the general feeling. It is an unfortunate dilemma which results from the great inflation since the original loan was taken out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unconvinced by all those arguments. As a parting shot, I remind the Minister that it was claimed both by this Government and the Soviet Union that it was a great triumph in relations between the two countries that we persuaded the Soviet Union to redeem debts incurred before the revolution, which had been frozen ever since. If we can do that, why on earth cannot we repay the original purchasers of 3½ per cent. war loan offers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>NATIONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 478, in page 144, line 43, leave out subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 176 gives the Government the power to introduce regulations to make changes to national savings accounts. Several aspects of the clause give some cause for concern. If the clause is accepted, the general power to make regulations will include a provision that enables the Government to restrict the classes of person who may open accounts with the National Savings bank. That is especially worrying in the light of the changes that the Government are in the process of introducing for premium bonds. That gives us a foretaste of what is likely to happen if this change goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are introducing a restriction on the initial purchase of premium bonds to a threshold of £100 and above. There are many small savers who would like to purchase premium bonds but who cannot possibly afford to meet that initial threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few weeks, many have contacted me and my hon. Friends to complain about the change. That change is being dealt with under regulation by the Government. It is subject to other legislative provisions. We may wish to return to the issue in greater detail in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change proposed in this clause relates to national savings accounts. Reading between the lines, it seems that national savings will be subject to exactly the same sort of exercise that has already been set in motion in relation to premium bonds.
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
The Government are ensuring that only certain categories of people will be able to invest in national savings. The inevitable result of such restrictions is that the small saver—whose investment is more expensive to administer and less lucrative from the Exchequer's point of view, but is none the less extremely important in terms of the value to the individual—is likely to be poenalised at the expense of the larger saver who can afford more and who can cross into the "classes of persons" amongst whom the Government wish to promote savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment removes the Government's power to ensure that certain categories of people can be treated differently from others regarding national savings. We tabled it in the hope that the Government would assure us about the way in which they intend to operate the clause, and also to express our great disquiet at the way that the Government seemed to be moving against the small saver in favour of the larger saver. In their policy on savings, the Government are discriminating between the two types of saver, to the advantage of the wealthier one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My reaction on reading the clause was the same as that of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). The reference to the restriction to certain classes of person makes me think that the National Savings bank is already doing that. It is restricting its accounts to certain classes of persons, initially by raising the starting deposit for national savings accounts and in future possibly doing what has been done in the case of premium bonds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never been an enthusiast of premium bonds because of a disinclination towards gambling. But it seems extraordinary that the Government should say to those who are prepared to buy premium bonds, "You can do this only if you go into it in a big way." For small savers, £100 is a large sum to put into a form of speculation for which no interest is payable unless one is the lucky winner of a prize. That is asking people to have a large flutter, not a small one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who accumulate more than £100 worth of premium bonds do so only in small stages. I have had letters from people who say, "When there is enough in the piggy bank, I go out and buy a premium bond. By that means I have accumulated £200 or £300 worth of premium bonds." My right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Steel) asked the Chancellor what proportion of the total purchases or premium bonds were currently made for less than £100. The Chancellor replied that the proportion was about 80 per cent. It is quite extraordinary that the Government should allow and encourage the national savings movement to turn its back on 80 per cent. of its purchasers. They do so presumably in the knowledge that the 20 per cent. are investing such large sums that they provide enough money to make it commercially justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The justification for the activities of the national savings movement is to attract small savings from small investors on a wide scale and perhaps going beyond what the commercial banks would normally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
do in the interests of broadening the base of saving. It is one of my arguments with the Government. As part of their counter-inflation strategy they could do more to encourage saving. They are certainly not doing that in their current activities towards the national savings institutions. The Bill carries echoes of what has been happening and adds to the fear that the small saver is simply of no interest to the Government. I refer to the small saver who has written to me and to other hon. Members expressing concern about premium bonds and the future of national savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the sort of clarification that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) wanted about the purpose of the clause. We are introducing the power to enable us to limit national savings and investment accounts to ordinary individuals as we have done with capital bonds and to exclude businesses and other corporate institutions from holding such accounts. Any such body which already has one will be allowed to retain it but no new accounts may be opened. That is the power we seek and the way that we intend to use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for explaining the Government's purpose in introducing this change. Can we therefore have a guarantee that the power that the Government are taking under this clause will not be used to introduce a threshold amount for national savings accounts which would act against the interests of the small saver?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were we to try to use the power in the clause to limit the amount we would be acting 	<i>ultra vires.</i> That is not the power that the clause gives. We already possess that power and have used it in a way that has already been criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of premium bonds has been raised tangetially to this issue and it is appropriate that I respond to it. We believe that the primary purpose of national savings should be to encourage personal saving and quality saving, by which I mean quality funding of the Government's borrowing—funding which cannot be instantly withdrawn. Premium bonds can be withdrawn instantly. They were introduced at a time when Governments were desperate for every kind of saving, and they have proved attractive, although initially controversial. Indeed, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) continues to have reservations about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Premium bonds are not savings of the highest quality and we therefore want to make sure that they are administered economically and effectively, because it would be foolish if we continued to seek savings which were not necessarily of the highest quality and which were expensive to administer. Small transactions in premium bonds are expensive to administer. An individual transaction can cost around £2. To sell £10 of premium bonds when £2 will be absorbed in the costs, largely made up of counter costs in the Post Office, would clearly not be an economic way to run national savings or to use the savings that we seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
Moreover, it cannot be the highest degree of prudence for Governments to encourage the very small savers to commit very small sums, even on a regular basis, to a form of saving where they put at risk the compensation for any depreciation in the value of money, which interest is, as is the case with premium bonds. If larger sums are put into premium bonds, the risk is spread and, over time, there is an average return which reflects the implicit rate of interest—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has never studied statistics and is unaware of the law of large numbers. It is a fairly well established law that is not disputed on a party basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who holds £10,000 worth of savings bonds will, in general, be more likely to receive a regular flow of income than someone who holds only £10 worth. To suggest that the Government should encourage small savers to put their small savings principally and primarly into premium bonds is not a view that I expected to hear from a Methodist lay preacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, if someone has £10,000 worth of premium bonds, statistically he stands a better chance of winning a prize than someone who has £10 worth. But it is also possible that he will not have a better chance. He may well end up with no flow of income from that holding. Equally, it is possible that the holder of £10 worth of premium bonds will receive a flow of income. That is the essence of premium bonds. Some people want to invest in them. It is a matter not of the Government encouraging people to do so but of them introducing regulations which will prevent people from investing in that way. For a Government who purport to favour choice for the consumer, it is an odd proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argues that we should encourage small savers to invest their very small sums in that way even though a considerable proporation of those sums is absorbed in administrative costs. That is not an appropriate way to run the Department for National Savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, will the Minister state categorically his support for the concept of premium bonds? He seems, at best, lukewarm about an investment that people make at their own risk, with their own money, in the full knowledge that they will have no return other than the happenchance of a prize. Secondly, what is the turnover in premium bonds? The Minister says that it is a poor form of investment and that he wishes to encourage longer-term saving. What is the rate of cashing-in of premium bonds by the typical small investor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have let the Committee have a flutter, but I remind hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the clause does not affect premium bonds. The matter was raised as an analogy, perfectly reasonably, and was somewhat developed. But I cannot allow the debate to go too far on that subject. If the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) so wishes, when he responds to the intervention he may make a passing reference and then we must leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, all that remains for me to do is to make a passing reference, and that is what I shall do. Through the measures announced on premium bonds, we seek to ensure that those transactions—a high cost of which is absorbed by the administrative arrangements—are not permitted to continue and that the threshold for investment is set at £100, as it is already for capital bonds and several other investments. There are other attractive forms of savings, provided by both national savings and the private sector, which give small savers the opportunity to invest their money safely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that is as far as you will allow me to go, Mr. Cormack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered the question that we sought by analogy to ask him, which was not whether premium bonds were a good thing. We got the message from the Minister that in this instance premium bonds are a good thing for neither the Government nor the investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked whether what has happened with premium bonds is a signal for what is likely to happen in national savings generally, which, in a rather perverse way, would be the effect of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained that in seeking to restrict the classes of persons holding national savings accounts he merely wishes to distinguish between personal savers and companies and businesses. The thrust of the argument that we put to the Minister, and on which I am at one with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), is that there appears to be an intention further to narrow, by increasing thresholds, the class of savers who use National Savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fear that what has happened with premium bonds will happen with ordinary National Savings accounts. The thresholds for opening accounts or for investing regular amounts will be so high that, for the reasons that the Minister adduced in the case of premium bonds, transactions will be costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
If transaction costs form a much higher proportion of small amounts received, the same argument will be used. Whole classes of persons—namely, the poor, the young and otherwise deserving small savers—will be excluded from access to national savings accounts of various kinds. It was in that context that premium bonds were raised. The Minister understandably got so wrapped up in the question of whether premium bonds were a good thing that we still have not had an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue Question Time if I may, Mr. Cormack. I answered the question, but perhaps the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed was so wrapped up in thinking of his next question or of his previous answer that he did not hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the clause will not allow us to affect the quantity of money invested, only the "class of persons". The terminology "classes of persons" is necessary because in law a company, society or club is a person. We are taking the power to exclude corporate persons, while leaving the primary role of national savings as the encouragement of personal, high quality savings, which I am sure that the Committee considers appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all heard the Minister's technical answers, but he did not say whether the Government had any intention of further restricting, by any means, access to national savings for whole classes of savers who have only small sums to deposit. I am sure that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury will wish to press this point. I suspect that the silence shows that the Government will give national savings every encouragement to restrict access to those accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For once, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is absolutely correct. He confirms my belief that my parents were right to vote for him in the contest for the leadership of the Liberal party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard a much more disapppointing performance from the Economic Secretary. He had every opportunity to give a clear guarantee that the Government have no intention of using the size of investment to restrict the ability of small savers to deposit funds in national savings accounts, but he gave no such assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain deeply worried about the Government's long-term intentions, but we accept the technical explanation about the meaning of "classes of persons". We also accept the Government's reasons for including the clause. Now that we have signalled our fears, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 480, in page 145, line 20, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations that the Government intend to introduce appear to give no interest payments on amounts deposited through national savings accounts. We had an interesting discussion about premium bonds and the interest that is not paid on them, but it has always been accepted that one of the purposes of having national savings accounts is that interest be paid on them. The Government seem to be giving themselves the potential power to pay no interest at all, while removing the 2.5 per cent. a year minimum provision for interest that is laid down in statute. We are puzzled about why the Government are removing those provisions. Why have national savings, if there is no intention of paying interest to people who save? It seems a contradiction in terms, and we are baffled about the Government's intention in making this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury is baffled about why we wish to remove this legal commitment to a specific rate of interest, but in my view, it is even more baffling why this interest rate should be enshrined in primary legislation. We think it more appropriate that the power should reside with the Department for National Savings, subject to Treasury agreement, to set the interest rate on this form of savings and to determine whether there should be an interest rate. It is appropriate to reflect the overall value of the savings to the saver in the interest rate, among other things, and to have the flexibility—as we do on most other products—to which, as far as I know, no one has ever objected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not good enough. The Economic Secretary seems to be arguing that simply because something is in legislation and appears to have an historic purpose rather than any other, it should be removed. The specific rate of interest is not 2.5 per cent.; it is an amount not less than 2.5
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
per cent., and in current circumstances—certainly if the Government continue in office much longer—2.5 per cent. interest is way below a respectable rate of interest, given base rates and inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also including among their statutory powers a power to give no interest whatever on national savings accounts. The Economic Secretary said that we did not understand the provision and that the Government wish to give total flexibility to the national savings board to determine its rates, but did not mention why a specific power is to be inlcuded in law to enable no interest to be paid on national savings accounts if circumstances so decide. Why are the Government doing that? If they do not give interest, people will not save in a national savings account, and rightly so. I am at a loss as to why the Government seek to abolish an initial threshold of interest which is very low and which imposes no genuine restriction on the board and then to include a potential nil rate in the provisions for national savings. The hon. Gentleman's explanation thus far has not been sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are doing this in the context of rendering more normal the powers to alter interest rates and it seemed sensible to abolish at the same time the artificial and largely unparalleled minimum rate of interest. We are talking about instant access current accounts, and this sort of irrevocable minimum interest rate is not necessarily a feature of all the competing products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the Government intend that interest will be paid and that it will be considerably about the 2.5 per cent. threshold figure. This is not a sufficiently major issue to press unnecessarily to a Division, but we remain somewhat puzzled by the Government's reasoning and the Economic Secretary's explanations.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer particularly to the Minister's failure to recognise that, far from being low-quality savings, premium bonds are perhaps the ideal high-quality savings for the Government as most are bought by people like me, stuck in a cupboard and forgotten about for 25 years. He glossed over a totally unsupported statement about their quality, based purely on the notional ability of people to cash in some types of savings more readily than others. I am willing to bet that that is not borne out by the facts. The rate of turnover for such saving shows that it is extremely high-quality saving, produced at relatively low cost.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
As to the Government's deliberate obstruction of the four out of every five people who wish to invest in savings in this way, it is clear that they have failed to recognise their value to the Exchequer and to individuals. If costs are as high as they claim, perhaps they ought to investigate the reason. Perhaps people would be prepared to pay an administrative charge to invest in the small amounts which they could afford. The Government have shown a total lack of commitment to the concept of premium bonds. That will prove unpopular generally and will illustrate their shameful inability to recognise the quality of this saving and its value to people. We should not accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As a result of his helpful reference to the matter, I have noted that my name was not listed although I was present and voted. I am recorded as speaking shortly before and immediately after the Division. I am puzzled because where my name was included in the Division list in the place of that of the hon. Member for Daventry, he, who was present and voting, will now have to be transferred to the "noes" column. That will have a strange effect on the arithmetic—at present it adds up, but it will no longer do so. I wonder, therefore, whether the confusion was not with me at all. I examined the column of names to see where the confusion could have arisen, and read the name of Mr. Peter Brooke. Here surely was the source of the confusion—the hon.

	<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>New Clause 9:</p>
	<p>	<i>Armed Forces (House Purchase Savings Scheme)</i></p>
	<p>'1. The Secretary of State for Defence be empowered to establish an Armed Forces savings scheme, whose purpose is to allow those servicemen who do not own houses to save for them, with comparable tax advantages to their civilian counterparts.</p>
	<p>2. An approved list of savings institutes, including building societies, banks and insurance companies, allowed to adopt the scheme, should be drawn up by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p>3. The scheme will be open to serving members of HM Forces who have completed one or more years' service and satisfy the following—
	<ol>
	<li>not a home owner or the owner of a portion of a house and—</li>
	<li>not married to or cohabiting with a person who is a home owner or the owner of a portion of a house.</li></ol></p>
	<p>4. The scheme will be treated as a Personal Equity Plan in the meaning of Schedule 8 of the Finance Act 1986. Regulations existing for such Plans may be amended in respect of the Armed Forces Savings Scheme by statutory instrument subject to amendment in pursuance of a resolution of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p>5. The rental portion of accommodation charges paid by service personnel participating in the scheme should be treated as interest payments eligible for relief under Schedule 9 of the 1972 Finance Act, subject to a maximum set out at subsection 7 below. The relief enjoyed should take the form of a monthly payment into the serviceman's scheme account.</p>
	<p>6. Similarly the serviceman can make voluntary contributions into the scheme without limit and enjoy the income tax treatment as in subsection 5 above subject to the maximum tax relief set out in subsection 7 below.</p>
	<p>7. The total tax relief the serviceman can enjoy in any one Financial year under subsections 5 and 6 combined is set by the application of minimum lending rate of on 6th April of that year to £30,000.</p>
	<p>8. The serviceman can only draw money from the fund, when one of the following three conditions is satisfied—
	<ol>
	<li>he buys a house in the United Kingdom or Eire. In this case the money is paid direct to a solicitor or licensed conveyancer, on presentation of a certificate to prove that the money is being used solely for home purchase. If he sells within three years he must make a refund as laid down in the statutory instrment, or</li>

	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
	<li>if he dies the full share of his account in the fund is paid to his spouse, if he has one, otherwise into his estate, or</li>
	<li>if he leaves the service he may make an application to withdraw funds for a purpose other than house purchase. In this case he will receive a portion of the value of his account as laid down in the statutory instrument.'.—[	<i>Mr Brazier.</i>]</li></ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in the age of the property-owning democracy. One of the great achievements of this Government is that 63 per cent. of homes in Great Britain today are owner-occupied. The clause is aimed at the regular army and some sections of the RAF who have been shut out of the property-owning democracy. Only 26 per cent. of people in the Army own their own houses. I shall try to show that many of them do so most reluctantly, being subjected to severe problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a good record in honouring the recommendations of the armed forces pay review body; they have done so every year since they were elected. What has happened on housing has not been intentional. Nevertheless, it has had a severe effect on Army morale. Dissatisfaction in the Army is now so great that in the first quarter of this year, the level of premature voluntary releases—people opting to leave the Army before the end of their engagement--is up by 140 per cent. on the corresponding period six years ago. The armed forces pay review body comments this year, as it has done in four previous years, that soldiers do not opt to leave early because of too low a level of pay, but because of other conditions of service. Housing is again identified as the primary factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hitherto, the Army has sought to tackle the problem with a variety of measures designed to encourage soldiers to buy houses. In the Royal Navy and parts of the Royal Air Force, families who are largely static are induced to buy homes and become owner occupiers. The soldier, unlike his counterparts in civilian life and in the other two services cannot do that. Half our Regular Army is serving abroad. The other half is widely dispersed in mainland Britain. A soldier may buy a house, but in most cases his family cannot live there. He has to become an absentee landlord. My local regiment, the Queen's Regiment, is a good example. It has three batallions. One is currently serving in Northern Ireland, one is serving in Germany, and the third is serving in Hampshire. But the third is no more fortunate than the other two because it will be in Germany in a year's time. Soldiers in that batallion who chose to buy a house now will rapidly find that they cannot live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for tabling the new clause is that today's soldier is faced with the desperate choice of doing nothing about his family's future housing, or buying a house and trying to let it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the first of those options. Members of the Committee will have heard from the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association, the services' welfare organisation, about the consider-
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
able misery that faces families who leave the Army. A sergeant whom I know, who has served 21 years in the Army, including 11 tours on active service in Ulster, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have seen a corporal opposite me with eighteen years service and a sergeant with twenty-two years' service round the corner evicted by bailiffs. I have three children at school. I do not understand why I should be joining the back of a queue behind delinquents and squatters for a council house after serving my country for over twenty years."</p></blockquote>
Naturally, service accommodation must be tied. No one would deny that the Ministry of Defence must repossess its quarters when a man leaves the services. But we must consider the sad circumstances of that sergeant and his family, and the thousands of others like them throughout the country who are homeless because they chose to serve their country, instead of entering the housing market as civilians and paying for their homes during their working lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative to doing nothing is for a serviceman to try to buy a house and let it. The majority of soldiers realise that such a proposition is not practical, which is why house ownership in the Army is so low. I have a dossier of cases that have been provided by a range of sources, including building societies, service welfare associations and individuals. They illustrate just how hopeless it is for soldiers to try to buy a house and let it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Federation of Army Wives has sent me details of many cases. I quote just one involving a major with three children, who was posted to Germany soon after buying his house. His tenant cleared out owing rent, and money to pay electricity and telephone bills, and left the house in a dreadful state. The major travelled back to the United Kingdom at his own expense, decided to cut his losses and sell his house. He cannot now afford to re-enter the housing market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from a letter that I have received from an officer's wife. I stress that most people who have bought houses are officers. The position for other ranks is even more hopeless. The wife's husband is a high flier, and it will be sad if the Army loses him in the next few months. The wife said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some years ago, we managed to get a foothold on the property market and now struggle to maintain a mortgage while paying for a married quarter. We have a mortgage of £40,000."</p></blockquote>
That is a relatively small mortgage—they entered the housing market before the big rise in prices. She pointed out that she is a teacher but, because of the mobility of her husband's service, her chances of obtaining a decent teaching job are enormously restricted. She goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"like many other service families we suffered the inevitable problems of letting. For a period of six months we received no rent and for a further six months we had a tenant who did not pay and who stole or damaged so much that we incurred yet more expense. We then had one year of trouble-free letting but of course we had to pay agent's fees".</p></blockquote>
The family had other costs to pay, too. The net rent that they received was subject to income tax. There is no tax relief on the rent that is paid. The wife ended her letter by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a scheme like yours were to be introduced this year we would be able to sell our house, put the money into it and we could then stay on in the Army."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
Then came the saddest sentence of all:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sadly, the Army is an anchronism; it looks as if we will no longer be able to afford to subsidise it."</p></blockquote>
I could cite examples of 20 or 30 such cases, but I do not wish to bore the Committee. The solution to the problem does not lie in using public money to provide more allowances to encourage soldiers to buy houses while they are in the services. That does not work. It is almost impossible for an officer—and patently absurd for a corporal in Germany—to try to run two households. After all, servicemen are the only people who are charged rent when they are on duty abroad. Every other category of public servant lives free when he or she is abroad, as do most people in the private sector. It is nonsense to think that a corporal or even an officer can run a household and pay rent on it in Germany and, at the same time, somehow manage all the costs of a mortgage and maintaining a property in England, regardless of whether he can get a tenant. That is why I believe that the problem has to be tackled by a fundamentally different method. It is no use trying to build on allowances that were introduced last year to assist people with buying and selling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a number of extremely valuable discussions on the subject with Ministers, four with the Ministry of Defence, including one with the Secretary of State. At those meetings, considerable interest and enthusiasm was shown in looking for a different route. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary was on the Front Bench to wind up the debate on the Army when many hon. Members raised this issue and he would have heard the constructive response from my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause represents the sort of alternative route that the Government should consider, and I shall spend the remainder of my speech explaining how it works. It is far simpler than it looks. Paragraphs 1 to 3 refer to servicemen of all the services although, as I said, the new clause is aimed principally at the Army because those in the Royal Navy and the bulk of those in the Royal Air Force are able to buy houses and live in them. However, any serviceman who does not own a home will be able to opt into a savings fund which is designed to provide a financial alternative to owning a house during service. It will allow a serviceman to accumulate funds so that at the end of his service he can be confident of being able to buy a house for his family without having one slung round his neck while he is serving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 hangs the scheme on a personal equity plan which, since the imaginative improvements announced in the Budget, has provided a convenient, off-the-peg, tax-exempt fund, just as a house is tax exempt. No matter how much it increases in value, a man's primary home is always exempt of tax. The personal equity plan is exempt of tax, so I suggest that the savings fund should take the form of a personal equity plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 proposes that a serviceman should get at least some return on his housing payments.
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
After all, 91 per cent. of people in this country are either owner occupiers or council or housing association tenants. Those in the former category who have mortgages are eligible for mortgage interest relief on their housing payments, while those in the latter category, through their housing payments, accumulate either a discount or, in the housing associations, a portable discount. Paragraph 5 proposes that the rental portion of the accommodation charges paid by a serviceman should be eligible for tax relief, but the relief should be paid into the fund in his name rather than back to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 deals with voluntary contributions that a serviceman could make, and I see no reason why there should be a limit on that. However, there would be a limit on the tax relief on those voluntary contributions which is set down in paragraph 7. It provides that the maximum tax relief that he could get in any one year under paragraphs 5 and 6 combined would be the minimum lending rated applied to £30,000. In other words, it is the analagous maximum that his civilian counterpart could get as an owner occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax benefits that a soldier would get by taking out one of those policies would be no more than he could get by buying a house. But the difference from a taxpayer's angle is that if he buys a house he will almost certainly have to leave the Army before long or leave his wife and family in the house while he lives somewhere else. With this scheme, he can continue to serve in the Army, so we would stem the loss of valuable and expensively trained personnel which gets worse quarter by quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the scheme would be minimal in gross terms, and I am firmly convinced that it would be negative in net terms because savings in retaining very expensively trained people would more than pay for any cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a quotation from a serving officer who wrote to the chairman of a building society which decided unofficially to canvass a number of people in the Army before deciding whether to support the scheme—as a number of building societies have done, including the Halifax which is the largest building society in England. It does not even provide PEP schemes but it is supporting the scheme because it believes that it would be in the interests of the armed forces. The letter from the officer states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have shown this paper to the six military serving members of my staff and to some of the retired ones. All with one voice have said 'If only a scheme like this had been in operation when I got married'."</p></blockquote>
The crucial sentence comes from a serving officer, who wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Anything would be better than the present moral blackmail to follow the drum and accept the very real problems of letting one's own property."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the new clause is to stop that moral blackmail of soldiers either to buy a house and become involved in appalling financial and other problems or to do nothing and end up homeless with their families at the end of their service. That is the point of the new clause.

11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government are concerned about our armed forces. Their record in honouring the recommendations of the armed forces pay review body has been extremely good, but the review body cannot deal with this matter. It must be tackled by another route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition oppose the new clause for several reasons. It appears to enshrine the basic principle that because an individual is in a position in which he is unable to take advantage of a tax concession, other tax arrangements should be made to enable him to receive the equivalent. We do not advocate that principle in the administration of the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was some time ago, so my terminology may be wrong, but is not the principle that the hon. Gentleman is attacking exactly the principle of the option mortgage, which was introduced by the Labour Government in the late 1960s to cover people who wanted to buy property and could not avail themselves of the full measure of tax relief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The analogy is not exact, [hon. Members: "Why not?"] Because when the option mortgage scheme was introduced a mechanism was established for receiving direct tax assistance in relation to activities being carried out. The matter that we are discussing is different because it concerns hypothetical activities. There is a difference between the two examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the specifics of the scheme for four principal reasons. First, why should it apply only to members of the armed forces? Many other people in many other professions must rent accommodation in connection with their professions or jobs, which means that they are unable to buy their own owner-occupied property for the duration of their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not sought the support of the Opposition, but I do note that there is still some confusion in the Labour Party on defence policy. During the Army debate two weeks ago the Labour party spokesman on defence matters—the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill)—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), whom I am wont to criticise … whenever I can, for once is right … We may disagree about the fine details, but they can be ironed out, which is what the House, at its best, is supposed to do."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 8th June 1989; Vol. 154, c. 452.]</p></blockquote>
Turning to the substantive point, the critical difference between the armed forces and every other category is the overseas aspect. Every other organisation that sends people abroad allows them to live rent free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be tempted by the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). My hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill), who speaks so excellently on defence matters, happens to be wrong on this fiscal matter. It is clear that on matters of taxation, the Opposition treasury team handles the issues. However beguiled my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
Friend may have been by the hon. Member for Canterbury into giving perhaps a warmer indication than, on reflection, he might wish to do to those proposals, the fiscal issues in the new clause are not ones that the Labour party can support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have four basic reasons why we disagree with the new clause. First, why should the armed services be singled out? There are other occupations which demand tied-rented accommodation, ranging from school caretakers to landlords of public houses. The same principles of the clause apply to all of those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about paying rent abroad adds a certain amount of weight to the argument, but that does not change the basic principle. That applies, too, to people in other circumstances. For example, there are people in high cost areas. My constituents on average, twice or even three times average earnings would find it impossible to buy accommodation in the area in which they wish to live, because of extremely high property values. Their only option for accommodation is to rent from the local authority, housing associations or the private market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the force majeur and the location in which people may wish or need to live for their job, they end up in rented accommodation without a realistic possibility of purchasing. Should not they be eligible for that sort of scheme if the new clause were enacted? Our first objection is that it singles out a particular group within the population when many other groups are in the same position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Canterbury made much of the difficulties facing a serviceman who buys a property but cannot live in it and has to rent it out. Under existing legislation, it is perfectly possible for someone to return to his owned property—which has been rented out temporarily, but which is his principal residence—after a period in the army. He can gain vacant occupation and there is no difficulty about that under present housing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point, which is that it is difficult to administer a house in another part of the country, and especially difficult if one is stationed abroad. The difficulty arises not in repossessing the house but in administering it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be difficulties in administering a property in such circumstances, but rental income must be set in the balance of advantage against administrative difficulties. Furthermore, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) reminds me, in normal circumstances a house is an appreciating capital asset. The property market is rather flat at present, but in most years the value of the asset appreciates. A person who owns a house in which he does not live but to which he subsequently returns must realise that owning property is a matter of swings and roundabouts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be led into thinking that there is an insuperable difficulty about gaining vacant possession. There is not. In these circumstances it is perfectly possible to regain vacant possession of one's property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
Thirdly, we are worried about the use of the personal equity plan mechanism. It is odd to use PEPs in that way; they are supposed to be a surrogate form of tax relief. Moreover, enshrined within PEPs is relief against capital gains as well as relief against interest payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman go back to the point that he made about an owner regaining possession of his house when he returns to this country? He said that there was no difficulty now. It is not so difficult now as it was before the present Government came to power. Does the hon. Gentleman guarantee that the next Labour Government—if ever there is one—will not make it more difficult for owners to regain possession of houses that they let?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. Since 1957, under governments of both political persuasions, an owner of a property returning to his only home after a period of work elsewhere who seeks to regain possession of a house to live in it himself or with his family has always been able to gain vacant possession. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will continue under the Labour Government who take office in two years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the new clause would permit the withdrawal of funds for purposes other than home purchase. Over the past year the Government have made it clear that they are anxious to ensure that mortgage interest tax relief is available only for home purchase. They have even removed the possibility of using mortgage interest tax relief to set against home improvement work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first reasonable point that the hon. Gentleman has made. The small print says that if a person withdraws funds for a purpose other than house purchase.
	<br><blockquote><p>"he will receive a portion of the value".</p></blockquote>
That portion would be laid down by statutory instrument. There must be a mechanism whereby those who inherit a house and so do not need to buy one can recover a portion of the money. I envisage that portion as the person's basic contributions less all the tax relief, but that would be a matter to be laid down in the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In drafting the new clause, the hon. Gentleman included the possibility of flexibility. None the less, the clause includes provision for the withdrawal of funds for purposes other than home purchase, with some, if not all, of the tax relief benefits involved. It does not specify that that could not happen, and we cannot support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition cannot accept the specifics of the new clause. It is dangerous to enshrine in legislation the principle that when people, for whatever reasons and however worthwhile their occupation or service to their country, cannot avail themselves of a tax opportunity that is available to others in different circumstances, the tax system should be changed to

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is fundamentally flawed. Members of the armed forces are in a unique position. There is no other profession for which people are trained to such an extent and at such cost to the taxpayer. The predicament derives from the taxpayer not getting the return on that investment, and my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) is right to raise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with my right hon. and hon. Friends, I admire the tenacity and perseverance with which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has pursued this theme. I accept entirely the righteousness of the principle of the new clause. Clearly, all is not well with home ownership and the opportunities for home ownership by members of the armed forces. That applies particularly to the Army. I welcome my hon. Friend's new clause as yet another chance to draw attention to a fundamental problem. I do not go the whole way as I am not convinced that my hon. Friend's solution is right, but I applaud him for tabling the new clause and support his general endeavours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something must be done about this issue. While acknowledging that the new clause might not be the solution, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will at least admit that this serious problem must be dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary does not need to make a speech because the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has taken over the role of Treasury Minister, explaining the obstacles that lie in the way of every solution. In doing so, the hon. Gentleman did a disservice to the proposal of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who referred to the drift out of the services and the pressures and hardships that can arise. After 10 years of a Government who are keen on the armed forces, that problem is serious not only in the Army, but in the other services. The hon. Member for Canterbury may regret that admission if it is referred to later, but that does not detract from the importance and value of his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are distinctive aspects to the serviceman's problem in buying a house. Many of those about whom the hon. Gentleman was talking have relatively modest rates of pay, live abroad, pay rent, are in no position to organise the letting of a house and even have some difficulty in organising the purchase of one. The whole business of trying to let a house when serving abroad is miserable and difficult. It involves all the problems of bad tenants who may treat the property badly or leave with bills owing, which is a far more frequent occurrence than some Opposition Members seem to have recognised. Often one has to come back and use leave and one's own resources to sort out a mess in the tenancy, not just once but two or three times.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
It is not uncommon to be let down by agents. Servicemen who put their affairs into the hands of a supposedly competent estate agent may discover that their affairs have not been properly been looked after. Nor is repossession quite as simple as is suggested. The inevitable dangers of a three-month delay imposed by the court in securing repossession come into play. Yet servicemen have relatively modest rates of pay and are as entitled to aspirations of home ownership as other sections of the community. Those arguments are adequate for the Government to consider such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Servicemen have to compete with local people for council housing in areas where that housing is in great demand. Although the view is widely taken by local authorities and by the Ministry of Defence that, when possible, servicemen retiring from the service should be given priority, it is not always easy to do that. Indeed, in some cases it may be impossible, if, for example the overwhelming requirements of a totally inadequate housed family come to the fore in making a housing decision. It is a source of difficulty and sometimes of inappropriate resentment when servicemen seek housing in an area of the country with which they have some association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem for servicemen is that there is no area of the country with which they have any reasonable association because of their work, and the way in which they have been shipped around the world in the service of the country and the interests of our defence. They find it difficult either to organise house purchase or to place themselves in a reasonably strong position when applying for a council house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's scheme is ingenious. Already he has built many safeguards into it to prevent abuse, but it still contains many serious loopholes. We must consider the costing and work out the potential take-up. The Government are already well accustomed to providing costings for schemes the take-up of which is uncertain. They will have to apply themselves to that test here. The hon. Gentlemen has put forward an ingenious proposal and deserves a serious answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must contain herself. If she has asked the hon.

Nothing said by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) or by the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) was remotely out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In deference to the feelings of the hon. Lady, I shall soften the statement "patent disregard" to "has not woken up to". The entire speech of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was a glorious piece of somnambulism. He did not appear to have woken up to the views of his defence spokesman, who congratulated my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury did not appear to have woken up to the analogy of a scheme that his party had introduced earlier, and he certainly had not woken up to the overseas problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a complete waste of resources expensively to train young men and women for the armed services and then to create a set of conditions under which they cannot sensibly continue their employment. Therefore, it is very much a Treasury matter that we should be considering the problems of recruitment and retention in the Army, and this particular problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury is right to raise the problem in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about the position of Army wives. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury appeared not to realise that in all other cases of service abroad, tied accommodation comes free. One reason is that wives accompanying their husbands abroad cannot always pursue their own careers. The hon. Gentleman talked at length about people who have tied accommodation in this country. But here wives are free to pursue their careers and that enhances the family's financial position. The Army is heavily discriminated against in that respect in that the wives cannot pursue their own careers. In addition, Army officers and men must pay the rent, so they are discriminated against twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman analysed the problem, he would discover that his suggestion might be more expensive to the Treasury and it would still not solve the problem of an Army wife being unable to enhance the family finances. For that reason, I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, although I admit that flaws in the scheme need ironing out. However, the principle is sound, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the matter, if for no other reason that it might at last elicit a proper response to a problem that we cannot afford to allow to continue in our armed services, either strategically or financially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends, I support the principle of the new clause. Although the wording may not at present be acceptable, there is no doubt that it raises the important issues of equity and military necessity which will become increasingly important over the next few years. I do not know whether the Government will accept the new clause, but I hope that they will recognise the importance of the problem and work on it in the months to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the problem will become more serious in the years ahead. The Army is the most affected of the services by the difficulties in home ownership, primarily because at any one time 50 per cent. of its staff serve overseas. Not only has the premature voluntary release rate increased by another 70 per cent. over the past five years—but the turnover of staff in the Army is rising and continues to rise. That is not because of pay, because in real terms, Army pay has increased considerably over the past 10 years; it is because other problems cause intense dissatisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Army is a heavily labour-intensive service, particularly compared with the Navy and the Air Force. At a time when the 18 to 25 age group is likely to decline by 30 or 40 per cent. over the next seven or eight years, and when the labour market for those people is tightening all the time, it does not make sense to put potential recruits under the kind of conditions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Unless these changes are made, there is a danger that either the Army will not recruit the kind of adequately skilled personnel it needs for an increas-
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
ingly technocratic military profession over the next 10 years or, when it does recruit them, it will not be able to keep the high quality personnel with the crucial skills in technology and leadership that will be increasingly required. Either way there will inevitably be a significant waste to the taxpayer.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are arguments of equity about the scheme which my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) and other hon. Friend's have adequately addressed. The scheme has pragmatic and equitable merits and I hope the the Government, if they cannot accept this new clause, will at least give their urgent attention to this important subject which is likely to become more important over the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make four brief points. It is not true, as the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) implies, that it is impossible for servicemen leaving the services to get council accommodation. Many councils make special arrangements for those special cases. Secondly, representing a part of London where there are tens of thousands of people on the waiting list I dislike the perjorative way in which the hon. Member's for Canterbury referred to those on waiting lists as hooligans and so on. The people on the waiting lists all over the country are people in the direst need. They do not differ in moral worth from servicemen. I dislike that implication in the hon. Member's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the particular reference to which the hon. Lady alludes, and which she has not got quite right, I was quoting someone else. This man had given 22 years' service to his country and could not help noticing some of the people who were ahead of him on the waiting list. I do not blame him for the remarks that he made with a certain amount of bitterness, but I could not do other than quote them verbatim to the Committee. I would have misled the Committee otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbot</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would blame him for his remarks. The people on the waiting list in Hackney are in the direst of need and I will not accept an argument which says that they are worth less than the serviceman to whom the hon. Members for Canterbury refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The heart of the argument of the hon. Member for Canterbury is that in some ways servicemen are a special case. Conservative Members attempted to say that the essence of the special case is that servicemen are abroad and cannot manage rented housing over here—first, they are on low incomes and, secondly, they are in effect in tied accommodation and at the end of their working lives they have no home to go to. The Opposition would argue that many workers—be they rural workers in tied cottages or school caretakers—are on low incomes, in tied accommodation and experience the same problems as servicemen at the end of their working lives. We cannot see why these advantageous tax arrangements should apply to one group of workers when workers in a parallel position would be excluded.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
Finally, the Opposition cannot take Conservative Member's seriously when they wring their hands and talk about massive investment in servicemen going to waste because of the problems of buying and retaining housing. If Conservative Member's are really concerned about retaining the services of public service workers in whom there has been massive investment, they should reconsider their vote on tax subsidies for private medicine. There is no greater drain on public servants, in whom there has been massive investment, than private medicine which attracts hundreds and thousands of nurses each year. I know that because my mother is a nurse. There has been massive public investment in such people, yet the private sector acts as a leech on the NHS. If Conservative Member's were seriously worried about the drain on public servants, in whom there has been such investment, they would have voted differently on the clauses relating to private medicine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not intervene for long, but I wish to comment on the serious problem that the armed services face—a problem which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) highlighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a brother who is a serving RAF officer. Although he would not probably wish to avail himself of such a scheme, some of this colleagues would certainly wish to do so. There is undoubtedly a problem. However, I am in considerable agreement with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) about the fiscal difficulties of the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury. His proposal is interesting and contains many ideas which are perhaps worthy of greater study. But to my mind the problem is more one of how the armed services should enable a serving soldier or airman to buy a house, ensure that it is properly maintained and let and that, when he finishes his time in the service, it will be available and in a condition fit for his return. If that is largely the problem, as I believe it to be, it is capable of solutions other than fiscal ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Service personnel are not the only people who are sent overseas and who buy property in which they cannot live at the time. At the risk of making my speech too much of a family run-around, I should say that I have another brother who is not in the RAF but is a long-time resident of Kenya. He has a flat in London and does precisely what I imagine most Army personnel do—he rents it out to tenants. Over the years, he has encountered all the problems that have been described of tenants destroying the flat, difficulties with agents and with lengthy periods when the flat has not been let, and the consequential financial burden which that causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are very real problems, but there are also very real benefits. His property has appreciated in value with the rise in property prices. When his property has been properly let, it has been largely self-financing because of the tax treatment accorded against the rentals received. Indeed, the rates are tax deductible, again against the rentals received. When things run smoothly, the property can be largely
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
self-financing. Therefore, it is not a burden on my brother who needs to maintain his family and housing in Kenya.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the experience of my family from both sides, the solution may be for the Army, perhaps the Air Force and possibly to a lesser extent the Navy, to find a way to assist personnel to let the properties which they buy. I do not suggest that the. Army should set up yet another agency to act as an estate agent. But surely it would be possible for the Army personnel department to supervise the operation of the agents used for letting out such properties, in a way that would perhaps remove some of the burden from the serving officer or soldier who is unable to give the personal attention to the let which might be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would seem to be proper solutions to the problem which do not involve the fiscal difficulties that the new clause would raise. Those fiscal difficulties have been properly described by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. As a matter of principle, I am somewhat reluctant to agree with him, but we London Members rarely stick together. It is a considerable shock to find that he and I are on the same side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been an interesting debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) agreed with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) who, in turn, did not agree with his own spokesman on defence. There is a divide in Committee. Some hon. Members want to hide behind a provision that may not seem fiscally sound to them. Others, such as me, analyse the problem and come up with what we hope is a practical solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the armed service man is a special category. I agree that others, such as tenants in agricultural cottages and people in similar circumstances, have their own problems, but there are special reasons why servicemen are different. The first is the percentage who are stationed abroad. The second is the rapidity with which they move—every two or three years—which is different from virtually any other occupation. The third and probably most important reason is the lack of control that servicemen have over where they go next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former serviceman, I can say that not to know where one will be living in six or eight weeks' time can be a destabilising influence. We must ensure that wherever possible tax incentives—for example, to buy one's own home—relate effectively to servicemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham suggested that one solution was to make it easier for servicemen to buy properties away from where they served. He is right in the sense that that has been the approach of the Ministry of Defence in the past, which is one reason why the Ministry has got it wrong time and again. The last allowances package was a disaster, as was shown to me as recently as last Saturday when I attended a function with the Chief of the Defence Staff. I have never seen so many embittered servicemen who, as a result of the package, are a lot worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
To make it easier for servicemen to purchase houses away from where they work is not the solution. It does not tackle the essential problem, which is how to ensure that servicemen work and live close to their homes. We do not want them to be encouraged to buy houses, perhaps in other countries, which lead to financial problems that mean that they cannot give 100 per cent. of their effort to their careers. Sooner, rather than later, they will decide to leave the service, taking with them their experience and expensive training which, with today's demographic changes, are difficult to get back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury is a good solution because it addresses itself to the essential problem. Rather than making servicemen a special case, the new clause levels the playing field in terms of tax treatment vis-à-vis most of those in civilian life who can take advantage of existing concessions and incentives for people to enter the property market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first and obvious point that struck me when listening to the comments of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) was this: other than the anecdotal evidence that he gave, which is of some background value, what evidence has he to support his case? What objective surveys have been carried out of servicemen's attitudes towards their terms and conditions of service? What makes a serviceman give up early? If the sole or major cause is that he cannot purchase a house at some stage during his service, the matter is worth considering, if not necessarily as part of this scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A standard survey is carried out every year into the armed forces' pay and conditions of service by the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay. That was used at the end by the Labour Government as well as the Conservative Government, and has been honoured every year by the Conservative Government. The review body has commented on housing as an issue of worry in several consecutive years, and I shall quote what it said in the last year. I stress that fiscal matters are specifically outside its brief, so it cannot touch on solutions to those problems and can only distantly point to them. It comments on the success of the Royal Navy in encouraging people to buy houses, because naval families are static and obviously wives do not go off on the ships, and then says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Army and Royal Air Force have different career patterns and wish to encourage accompanied service. The new package of allowances gives some help to those who wish to buy and sell on posting, but it remains to be seen how many will choose this option. We shall also watch the effect of changes in allowances which make it financially unattractive"—</p></blockquote>
that is relevant to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe)
	<br><blockquote><p>"for married personnel to choose to serve unaccompanied. This may particularly affect those wishing to settle their families towards the end of their service."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
Then we reach the crucial sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Allowance is made in the X factor for the problems of turbulence, but we believe it is important that concern about house ownership should not become a major drawback of Service life to the point of distorting the pay needed to recruit and retain personnel."</p></blockquote>
In the previous year, the review body stated the housing problem even more strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it is a pity that it did not do more about it. It points more to incompetence in the armed forces administration, particularly in the Ministry of Defence, than to lack of care in the Treasury—the Department that concerns us in our deliberations on the Finance Bill. There is clear evidence of incompetence in the way that the Ministry of Defence is run and of lack of concern for the people whom it employs, particularly serving soldiers. There was its failure, for example, to act on allegations of bullying in the armed forces until the matter was made so embarrassing for it by hon. Members on both sides of the House that it was obliged to act. That is one example of its lack of concern for the people in its employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the experience of others in tied houses that are owned and run by the Ministry, in particular former constituents of mine in the regional division in Fife, who were desperate to purchase the houses in which they lived—God knows why, because they were miles from anywhere. The case went on for five years, and during that time there was no whit of evidence of the Ministry of Defence doing anything to help those employees, many of whom had given it decades of service in munitions work—a particularly dangerous occupation. That is another example of the Ministry's attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) said that there were problems with the package of conditions. It is a sign of incompetence in an employer. We are not here to argue about the benefits or otherwise of fiscal changes to remedy the effects of incompetent employers, which the Ministry of Defence clearly is; that is not our job. It is the job of the Ministry of Defence, and there are certain actions that it could take. It could look at the pattern of charges for accommodation of people living abroad. There is an anomaly that diplomats are allowed to have their accommodation paid for whey they are serving abroad, while servicemen do not have that advantage, and I accept that, as any other reasonable person would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman probably realises it, but the amounts that servicemen are charged abroad is a direct result of the military salary that was introducted in 1969.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not trying to make a party political point. I was attempting to work out whether it is a reasonable request during a Finance Bill Committee stage for that to be taken into account. The evidence is that it is not. Contrary evidence suggests that the Ministry of Defence ought to be taking effective action and investigating far more than a few references which, as a scientist of many years' standing, I would not accept as scientific

	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
evidence of disquiet. Anecdotal reports quoted by individuals do not amount to scientific evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other employers attempt to discover what causes disquiet among their troops; the Ministry of Defence could also do it. It could find out what it is that makes service personnel give up early, and causes this great waste of public money. It would find to its surprise that it could itself take effective action. For example, it could do what was suggested when people rent houses and a person who cannot have a specific house because he has special needs could be given another, with an equivalent discount for purchase. There is no reason why the Ministry of Defence could not do that and make rented service in Army property qualify in some way for a house elsewhere. The Ministry would have to weigh off the benefit of keeping people in service for their full contract, or perhaps for an extra term, against the loss to it of having to train extra people. It might find that it would save money, whereas the proposed scheme would cost the Treasury more and would give no incentive to the Ministry of Defence to mend its ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly, as the subject has been rehearsed fully. I add my voice in support of the thinking behind the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). It has been established beyond peradventure that servicemen face a special problem. There may be other special problems in our society and economy, but it is unusual that there is such a low level of house purchase and such a high level of attrition of skilled men, from the service at early ages. Such problems would give any Government cause to consider what action to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether my hon. Friend's suggestion is the right one, there is probably time for further reflection, but not too much time because, following the speech of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), I suspect that if we sit debating it philosophically and at length, we may take many years—as did the Royal Commissions that we used to appoint—and still not reach a conclusion. Therefore there is a difficult balance to be struck between intervening in this process and going through its detailed underlying causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary were minded to go down that road, he would have to look at means of ring-fencing the clause so that it did not open the way to unanticipated fiscal extravaganzas. Equally, he would need to have regard to other categories that, somehow, in equity, were entitled to similar treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has performed a service by raising this issue in Committee. It is serious and needs to be considered alongside the way in which we treat, and regard, our servicemen, whom all of us value. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will consider this matter favourably and respond in the spirit in which the new clause was tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) highlighted an important problem. I support the principle of his new
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
clause, although I realise that there would be inherent practical difficulties. When my hon. Friend the Minister responds, I hope that he will give us some hope that the problem can be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr Beith) that Opposition Members underestimate the problems of regaining possession, especially by people who are inexperienced in the property world, who may be unsophisticated and what is more, may live abroad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question has not been raised, but it is important when it comes to regaining possession. Many of the servicemen who have bought houses have never lived in them, for the good reason that they have traded up in the market during their period of service. Unless someone has established by living in it, that the house that he is renting out is his principal home before he lets it, he cannot, under the old legislation, regain possession, so those in the services found great difficulty in regaining possession under the old legislation. Under the provisions for assured tenancies in the Housing Act 1988, most of those problems have disappeared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate had two outstanding features. The first was the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier). I am sure that all my hon. Friends will wish me to pay tribute to him; he has shown extraordinary energy and determination in bringing this issue to the attention of Ministers. All those who have heard him tonight will have recognised his sincerity, and his deep concern for the welfare of those in the armed forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other outstanding feature of the debate was the sharp way in which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) slapped down the Labour party defence spokesman. I had understood that the Labour party intended to downgrade the Treasury, but now either it has decided to reassert the traditional position of the Treasury in government, or to pursue a unilateral fiscal policy. Labour Members are certainly not taking up their traditional attitudes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like first to concentrate on the tax reliefs as such. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury will understand that that is my main responsibility. I shall, of course, make a few observations on the issue, although my hon. Friend is more knowledgeable on that than I shall ever be. I accept that my hon. Friend has put his finger on a matter of real importance. I listened to the debate on the Army, and heard my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces, the hon. Member for Romford (Mr. Neuberg), reply to the debate and to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause contains a very elaborate scheme. My hon. Friend is asking for three separate tax reliefs for servicemen who do not own homes. He seeks, first, relief for rent paid for service accommodation; secondly, relief on additional contributions made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
voluntarily by servicemen up to a £30,000 limit, and, thirdly, exemption from tax on income and capital gains realised by the investment fund in which the additional contributions are held, which is to be treated as a sort of personal equity plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief for rent causes considerable difficulty, as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury knows. We estimate that some 160,000 servicemen would qualify for the reliefs; slightly fewer than half live in married quarters and the rest in single accommodation. Notwithstanding the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans), that accommodation is subsidised and provided at rents below the economic rents that most tenants in the public and private sectors now pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury said, in the civilian population about 12.5 million people are either tenants or married to tenants in the public or private sectors. As he emphasised, many of those have the right to buy at a discount, but in the meantime they are paying higher economic rents than their service counterparts. Over the years, many attempts to obtain relief on rent have been resisted by Labour and Conservative governments. It would be contrary to the housing policies of previous governments to have rent deductible against tax. Given the number of tenants in the country, it would be difficult to grant such a concession to people in the services, but deny it to other tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the second relief proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury. It is front-end relief that would allow contributions to be made to a fund. The contributions qualifying for relief would represent the difference between the rent paid and the equivalent of the maximum interest on which the mortgagee with a loan of £30,000 or more might obtain relief. The limit would be calculated by reference to the base rate. There are several objections to the proposal. I emphasise that home owners with loans of less than £30,000 do not receive top-up tax relief to bring them up to amount of £30,000. My hon. Friend may be surprised to know that 74 per cent. of existing mortgages are below £30,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will in a moment. My major objection to the proposal is that it is not consistent in relation to savings through a personal equity plan. Our policy is to exempt from tax capital gains and income within PEPs. Several of my hon. Friends have been pressing me on the issue, and they know that we firmly reject the idea of front-end relief as it would amount to a considerable subsidy. Having taken the decision to deny it on PEPs and many elements of the tax system, it would be difficult to allow it in the case of servicemen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax relief is given on interest that is paid—on money that has gone. But what is being proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
under the scheme is that people obtain relief, not just on the interest, but on the capital investment. That would go well beyond the relief that is available to home owners. They receive relief on the money that is sunk into interest, not on the capital payments. Does my hon Friend wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to my right hon. Friend's point that 74 per cent. of current
mortgages are below £30,000. I presume that the mortgage holders are predominantly people who have had mortgages
for a long time, not those who have taken them out during the past year or two. The same position would apply to servicemen. I doubt whether many ranks in the Army can afford to make sufficiently large voluntary contributions to obtain the full tax relief. Therefore, the position is parallel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. My hon. Friend's scheme would make it possible for people to receive a top-up to the amount of £30,000. Such a proposal is difficult to justify, when such a concession is not available to people who have reduced their mortgages, older people or those with existing mortgages—all home owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third tax relief that my hon. Friend proposes would exempt the tax on income and gains as applies in a PEP. That is acceptable in principle, although it is open to servicemen to take out PEPs. From reading the financial pages, we all know that PEP mortgages are becoming a well-established feature of the financial landscape. I do not object to that last part in itself, but the three reliefs taken together run contrary to the general thrust of our tax policy and would be extremely complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury that I have left out a number of other arguments that I know he would regard as involving rather nitty-gritty or small points. For example, those members of the Committee who dealt with mortgage interest relief last year will remember that the whole question of relief for the private residence has been put on a residence basis. I regret that the whole of the structure that my hon. Friend put forward is incompatible with the new residence basis, so I have the gravest doubts whether the scheme could work. I fear that it would be an over-generous tax relief in a number of ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is concern about this issue, but we must keep it in perspective. It is true that other ranks in the Army are well below the national average for home ownership but those who leave the Army tend to be relatively young. When comparing the other ranks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why are they leaving?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will allow me to develop my argument, I shall make a simple point. My hon. Friend knows considerably more about this subject than I do, but in the Navy, for example, the percentage of home ownership is above the national average for both other ranks and officers. For officers in the RAF it is considerably above the national average, though for other ranks it is below it. An interesting feature is that the Navy has a recruitment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
problem as it is losing people even though home ownership is well above the national average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Wyre and for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe) made the point that we had to consider this matter in the round. We have to take account of the cost of paying the many people in the armed forces and they represent a very expensive investment. However, we must decide how far that is related to the specific issue of housing. For example, I am informed that home ownership among fast jet pilots is not out of line with the national average, yet we have considerable problems in recruiting such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) asked about attitude surveys. I was interested in his question because regular attitude surveys are conducted among leavers and my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury referred to them. Of course, he was absolutely right to say that housing not only causes worry but is an increasing worry. However, it comes tenth on the list of worries that is raised by officers and twelfth on that of other ranks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to deny that there is considerable anxiety about this issue because I know that there is. I have talked to Ministers in the Ministry of Defence about that matter, so I am aware that servicemen feel strongly about it. But, as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said, we must regard it in the context of other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury made a point of considerable validity about people living rent-free in the public sector while overseas. It is right that that should be taken into account, but we must also take into account the fact that very few of those other public and private sector people are subsidised in their housing while in the United Kingdom. That must be included in the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend put his finger on a problem. I know that the Ministry of Defence is worried about it and I have spoken to Ministers in that Department about it. Recruitment and retention is a matter for the overall remuneration package and the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay, which takes that into account. I am sceptical as to whether fiscal means are the best way of tackling the problem. Defence Ministers are reviewing the matter and the Treasury will be discussing it with them. I shall ensure that my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is fully informed of our debate, my hon. Friend's anxieties and the valid points that have been made. I cannot commit my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, but I assure my hon. Friend that I shall draw the matter to my right hon. Friend's attention and that it will be seriously considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for his closing comment that there will be further discussion on the matter. It may seem churlish, but I wish to respond quickly to two or three points that were raised during his helpful speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolutely true that factors other than housing are involved in retention and, in the Navy, separation is the key factor, not housing. I shall give three sources for suggesting that housing is the most important factor in the Army. I have already quoted
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
the comments of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay. The second source is a letter from the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association. This is the first time during the five years that the present controller has been in his post that he has chosen to write to politicians and lobby on any subject. Anyone who has read the letter is in no doubt that housing is the most important issue. I have a similar letter from the Federation of Army Wives, which I know has already been passed to my right hon. Friend by the Ministry of Defence. It makes the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the details of the tax points made by my right hon. Friend, except to say that, rolled up together in toto, servicemen would still be left with an overall package that is marginally less favourable than that which a civilian owner-occupier enjoys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem will not go away. We have had a wide-ranging debate and great anxiety has been expressed by many Conservative Members. The problem must be solved by fiscal means because every method involving allowances that has been tried has failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is one on which I am sure that the Committee wishes to unite. The comments of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) on the Ministry of Defence's care of its employees should be considered in the context of the single statistic that, however bad the levels of premature voluntary release may be now in the armed forces, they are approaching only half the level that existed at the end of the previous Labour Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this new clause is to put it beyond doubt that the new receipts basis of assessment for earnings under schedule E does not extend to pensions or social security benefits, which will therefore continue to be chargeable on an entitlement basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order not to weary the Committee, perhaps I should explain that the complex matter of the receipts basis was introduced for administrative reasons. The same administrative arguments do not apply for social security benefits and there is nothing more to it than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is as well that we are not discussing a contentious matter now, as it is late. The Governments' new clause seems to be fairly innocuous. I understand that pensions will be assessible on a crawl basis, and not just when the pension is paid. I am not sure how substantially that will change the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I was not listening too carefully to the hon.

Gentleman knows that I always take him seriously, but as he prefaced his remarks by saying that the hour was late, my concentration was not as great as it has been earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by those who consider such matters on our behalf that the issue is not particularly contentious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assumed that the Financial Secretary would have an explanation or reason for the change that is being made. It struck our advisers that the position was not substantially different from what pertains now. I was sure that the Financial Secretary would be able to explain the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered the hon. Gentleman's question, but he could not have taken in what I said. I said that the schedule E receipts basis was introduced for administrative reasons relating to deferral of earnings from one year to another. Social security benefits have always been chargeable to tax on an entitlement basis. To move from an entitlement basis to a receipts basis for social security benefits would make precious little difference to pensioners. It might, possibly, in certain circumstances, lead to a certain bunching of earnings, which would be disadvantageous, but that would not always be the effect. There is no good reason to apply the receipts-based basis to pensioners, and other social security benefits, and it would make the administration and the charging to tax much more complicated. The new clause will exempt social security benefits from the basic receipts method of taxing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My eagerness to leap to my feet has been properly reprimanded by your impeccable sense of order, Mr. Cormack. I have two questions for the Financial Secretary in relation to the new clauses which appear to remove the charge to stamp duty of certain transactions involving a stock exchange nominee. First, why do the Government regard the involvement of stock exchange nominees as triggering the removal of stamp duty and reserve stamp duty? Secondly, new clause 23 has a cumbersome format. It sets out in tortuous detail the difference between a notice given and information supplied. I fail to understand why it is put in that form. Is there is a sensible explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall explain the background to the new clauses because for once, the hon. Gentleman, who is extremely perceptive, has not understood their purpose. As it is important, I shall outline their purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As foreshadowed at the time of the Budget, the new clauses provide the power for the Government to make regulations relating to stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. Their purpose is to enable both taxes to be adapted to the new methods of transferring shares that are now being developed in the stock exchange. The most important method is the stock exchange's plan to move to a paperless system of holding and of transferring shares. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the initiative known as TAURUS. We welcome that initiative, as it holds out the possibility of cheaper dealing costs and is likely to give considerable impetus to wider share ownership. But we also need to cater for revised arrangements for the initial period of dealing following a new share issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
None of these developments is yet final—they are all still being evolved. The tax rules must therefore evolve with them and, for the time being, will need to be flexible. That is why we are not introducing primary legislation this year. Instead we have proposed regulation-making powers to deal with any transactions under the new methods that take place in the evolutionary period. We have had detailed consultation with all those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the switch to paperless share dealing, stamp duty will no longer be payable—one cannot stamp something that does not exist. The main tax will therefore become stamp duty reserve tax, which will be charged every time there is an agreement to transfer shares. So, with a system such as TAURUS, which makes provision for errors to be rectified and mismatched bargains to be unscrambled, a single completed bargain could end up paying tax many times over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury also asked about new clause 23, which I shall deal with now. New clause 23 supplements new clauses 21 and 22 by dealing with a narrow administrative point. When information about stamp duty reserve tax liabilities comes from the taxpayer's own computer—or from TAURUS itself—and is in turn processed by an Inland Revenue computer, the Revenue clearly needs to be able to ask for that information to be presented to it in a particular format. For example, the new clause gives the Revenue the power to prescribe the size and type of computer disc and the order in which the information should be set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic purpose of the new clauses is to cover the move to the paperless system and adapting stamp duty reserve tax to that new world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
