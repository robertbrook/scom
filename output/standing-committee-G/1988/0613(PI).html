<p>Finance Bill</p>
<p>(Except clauses 1, 32, 33, 44, 51 and 138)</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will have noticed that a new order of consideration motion has been tabled, which amends the earlier one. We shall discuss it first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the order in which the remaining proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 109 and 110, Clauses 113 to 117, Clauses 120 and 121, Schedule 13, Clauses 122 to 124, Schedule 14, Clauses 125 to 135, Clause 137 Schedule 15, Clauses 139 to 151, Clauses 153 to 156, Clause 97, Clauses 157 to 168, Clauses 170 to 173, Schedule 16, Clauses 174 to 180, Clauses 98 to 108, Schedule 12, new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 17.</p></blockquote>
The motion defers the Committee's consideration of clauses 98 to 108 and schedule 12 until after we have considered the other clauses. On 25 May, in reply to a parliamentary question, I said that we would propose amenedments that deal with close investment companies. The changes are substantial and will involve a new clause. We hope to table the necessary amenedments and the new clause later this week. However, it will be convenient to the Committee if we defer consideration of those provisions so that we can debte those clauses and amendments together and allow hon. Members the opportunity to study the terms of the proposed changes before the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Crowther—hon. Members had noticed the motion on the amendment paper. The Government were good enough to let the Opposition know of their intentions, but we are not relaxed about the matter. Obviously, we have not seen details of the Government's proposals and we should postpone final judgment until we do, but the Government's handling of the issues has not inspired confidence<br><br>
The issues of contention is over apportionment. The Government's amdendments deal with companies that have five or fewer shareholders. The legislation used to be aimed at preventing taking shares in companies and treating income essentially as investment. The issue, therefore, is one of tax avoidance. I accept that the Government's alignment of capital gains and income tax has made that area less attractive than before, but important issues are still at stake. For example, there is no national insurance on a capital gain and there are still generous capital gains exemptions.<br><br>
The new regime announced on Budget day gave a wide definition of close companies and treated them
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
as if they were individuals. Property investment and share-dealing companies were automatically included. I have only the Government press release, but the Government seem to intend to abolish the existing apportionment regime and to change the definition from the one announced during the Budget to make it fairly loose. We cannot assert our views with complete confidence until we know the Government's real intentions, but from what has been said so far, it seems possible that almost everybody—especially share-dealing and property investment companies—will be able to escape the close investment company net.<br><br>
Clearly, the Government have only a limited number of possible explanations for the current state of affairs. Either their original proposal was ill prepared, or they have given in to lobbyists, particularly to property investment lobbyists. If either of those possibilities is true, the Financial Secretary should say so. A third possible explanation is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been overruled by whomever is in a position to overrule him. There is considerable press speculation about who that could be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Alan Walters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not relaxed about the abolition of the existing network of anti-avoidance rules or about their proposed replacement, which seems to be very weak. We are worried also that the penalties seem to be substantially less severe. We see nothing that would prevent tax avoidance by wealthy nonresidents via property companies with substantial debt. That is precisely the type of tax avoidance loophole that the Government should be blocking rather than facilitating.<br><br>
If the Financial Secretary can admit honestly either that the Governments original legislation was ill prepared, or that the Government have given in to the property lobby or been bullied by the Prime Minister, I should be happy to proceed. However, without such a clear explanation we shall have to vote against the proposition before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee to wait until the Government have managed to put together a new clause before we debate it, but it is not for the convenience of those outside the Committee who have to administer the law. A real world goes on outside the Committee and the processes by which the Government enact Finance Bills cause considerable disarray and irritation. The provisions under consideration affect the current tax year, which has begun already. Companies, advisers and accountants must work on plans for the affairs of companies relating to the current tax year. They are still not in a position to know what the tax provisions for that year will be. The decision that these clauses will not be taken until later in the consideration of the Bill, and the fact that the Government have not yet produced them, will cause further delay.<br><br>
Is it a matter of principle to the Financial Secretary that the taxpayer should know what the law is? It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
one of the most simple principles of taxation that the taxpayer should know what the law is and be entitled to order his affairs in accordance with it. The taxpayer cannot know what the law is if, because of the Governments delays, the Committee considering the Finance Bill has to advance well into the tax year in question before it can decide what the law will be. That may support the argument that there should be a different structure for financial legislation. A Finance Bill could deal with the main changes of a general economic management and political character, which the Chancellor introduces in his Budget. A more technical Bill could be the subject of much wider consultation, after a period within which that consultation could take place—an autumn Finance Bill, perhaps. Ministers will be familiar with that argument, as it has raged on many previous occasions.<br><br>
Regardless of whether Ministers are inclined to accept this alternative route, the present system and the delays implicit in this motion cause enormous difficulties for those who are engaged professionally in advising on tax legislation and for citizens who are entitled to organise their affairs with a reasonable knowledge of the law. I listened with interest and some sympathy to the argument of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), but I am not sure what he meant when he said, "We are not relaxed". That seems to be roughly the equivalent of Queen Victoria saying, "We are not amused."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not using the royal "we" as the Prime Minister or the leader of the Social Democratic party would use it; I use it to denote the parliamentary Opposition. I make the distinction between our present view and the usual state of affairs because we have sought to ensure that progress is made on the Bill, but that we also trawl through the issues in a workmanlike way, fully exploring the contents of the Bill and discharging our duties to the House. We have not sought to frustrate the Government on purely organisational matters, but we suspect that something more than an organisational matter is involved here. This is a pretty fundamental change in the legislation that was proposed at the time of the Budget. We want to know why it has been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that amplification of a rather recherché phrase. If the hon. Member decides to press the matter to a Division I would be inclined to vote with him. The way in which major pieces of tax legislation are being handled here is unreasonable to the taxpaying public and to those who advise on these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate to debate the merits of the amendments that we are making to the close investment company proposals in the Bill. But it is important that the Committee debates the Government's proposals as they are. It will be given every opportunity to scrutinise them in detail. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) says that there is a real world outside and that people must know about the proposals that affect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
them. Of course they must, but they need to know what those proposals are. We do not need two debates, one on the proposals as unamended and another on the proposals that we intend to bring forward. It is much more convenient for the world outside if we do not waste time debating proposals that might have been and debate the proposals that we are bringing forward. That is simple common sense.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed says that we cannot delay and that time passes he knows perfectly well that none of these proposals—either those that we might have brought forward or those that we will bring forward—would have any effect until the Bill receives Royal Assent. There might have been amendments. After all, he and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) continually put forward arguments. We listen to them and occasionally we accept them. Occasionally we amend the legislation. The world outside wants to know what the legislation is as amended, not anything else. It is nonsense to say that we are delaying informing the world outside.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East said that "we are not relaxed." He said that that was not the royal "we". Apparently it is the Socialist or collectivist "we" who are not relaxed. I can reveal to the Committee why the hon. Gentleman is not relaxed. The reason, as I read in <i>The Independent</i> today, is that it is his birthday. On behalf of Conservative Members, because we appreciate the hon. Gentleman and the witty speeches that he makes, I should like to wish him very many happy returns of the day—[hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]. Unfortunately, we cannot accept his objections, and the sooner we get on and vote on the matter the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Turner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-East:)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> The best birthday present that the Financial Secretary could have given would have been to explain the reason for the major change that we are debating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not addressed himself to the question that has been expressed in different form by both the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East—I also congratulate him warmly on his birthday—and myself. Why did the Government go to the trouble of printing pages 72 to 81 of the Bill, giving the financial world the impression that this was to be the shape of the Finance Bill? Much time and energy has been wasted on that. No doubt for some good and compelling reason the Government have changed their mind. The Minister cannot get away with the idea that the Finance Bill as brought before the House does not have real practical influence on the way the financial decisions of companies are made.<br><br>
The Government have a very large majority and it takes the stirring of deep religious feelings on issues such as Sunday trading to defeat that majority. Therefore, it is assumed that the Bill will be in pretty much the same from when it is brought back before the House, however powerful and compelling the arguments from the Opposition, or even from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
Conservative Back Benchers, such as the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton).<br><br>
On such a major issue, surely it is reasonable to know as early as possible what the shape of the legislation will be. We did not know in reasonable time. We had good reason to assume that we knew, because of the series of clauses in the Bill. However, the Minister has failed to give any good reason why we do not have the clauses in front of us so that we can debate them now. He has not told us why the clauses in the Bill or the amendments already on the amendment paper do not cover the various points that he wants to raise in Committee later. In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, we must oppose the Government in a Division.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) makes his point. However, he might have been a bit more reasonable and mentioned that, in reply to a parliamentary question, we spelt out in detail precisely what the amendments to the close company legislation are. There has been a detailed statement about the changes, and I have written to hon. members with those details. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed may have had a problem with his post, or perhaps he has not opened his mail. Nevertheless, I have informed him about the changes.<br><br>
The changes have been widely welcomed. They have been made in response to legitimate points raised about the Government's original proposals. We are not saying that our proposals should not be debated—we are simply suggesting that they should be debated later in the Bill's proceedings. They will be fully debated, and quite properly too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Arbuthnot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wanstead and Woodford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The changes are welcome, and the delay is only sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This will seem terribly churlish after the Financial Secretary's kind words about my birthday and my witty speeches. Nevertheless, at the risk of souring the atmosphere, I feel that it is necessary to divide on the motion.<br><br>
There can be only two reasons why the Government are seeking to change the order of consideration and the proposals that were announced at Budget time. Either the original proposals were ill prepared, or the Government have given in to powerful lobbying by property interests. In the absence of a frank explanation from the Financial Secretary as to which reason applies—incompetence or acquiescence to vested interests—we must vote against the motion.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"That the order in which the remaining proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 109 and 110, Clauses 113 to 117, Clauses 120 and 121, Schedule 13, Clauses 122 to 124, Schedule 14, Clauses 125 to 135, Clause 137, Schedule 15, Clauses 139 to 151, Clauses 153 to 156, Clause 97, Clauses 157 to 168, Clauses 170 to 173, Schedule 16, Clauses 174 to 180, Clauses 98 to 108, Schedule 12, new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 17."</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. I noticed that the annunciator screen showed that there was a Division in the Finance Bill Committee after the doors had been locked. Recent experience leads me to believe that that is s slightly dangerous practice. Either we shall have the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) doing his Black Rod act again, as he did in a previous sitting with a wonderful knocking on the door, or we shall have Members desperately racing up the steps outside and having heart attacks, all in vain. It is one thing to risk a heart attack with a prospect of voting, but another to do so with no prospect at all.<br><br>
Obviously, there is a limitation on how quickly the announcement can appear on the screen though it seemed to appear fairly quickly. However, if the announcement is to appear on the screen, surely there should be an interval after it has appeared before the doors are locked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Member's point. The difficulty, of course, is that we are fairly remote down here, whereas when we are up on the usual Committee Floor, if hon. Members are in other Committees, they can get there very easily. I understand the problem, but on the other hand it would not be sensible to wait 10 minutes or so for a Division to take place. It is a matter for the occupant of the Chair to use his discretion, which was precisely what I was doing. In the exercise of my discretion I might say, entirely unofficially and informally, that I catch certain eyes of certain Whips in the Room, but that is off the record. I am not supposed to do that. I suppose that I use the discretion without the benefit of any advice from anyone.<br><br>
I understand the hon. Member's point, but we cannot spend a lot of time waiting for hon. Members who may be in a remote part of the House to get here to take part in a Division. I expect members of the

Clause 109</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
OUTRIGHT GIFTS ETC. BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 398 in page 82, line 16, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or (c) the gift was undertaken with the sole or main objective of achieving a tax advantage.".</p></blockquote>
On behalf of myself and my hon. Friends I should like to extend our good wishes to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), who I believe has reached the age of 30 today. We, therefore, wish him many happy returns.<br><br>
I am tempted to observe that the Financial Secretary's good wishes follow the familiar pattern of the Government—generous rhetoric without any action behind it. It would have been nice to have a fuller explanation from him along with his kind birthday wishes.<br><br>
Clause 109 deals with cases where an outright gift is made between a husband and wife, in relation to the onset of independent taxation in April next year. The clause ensures that where an outright gift of assets is made, and where income is generated therefrom, the income will be taxed as income of the recipient rather than of the donor.<br><br>
Two good principals underline the change in the clause. In general, it seems sensible to tax the recipient rather than the giver of a gift or income. It is a principle that would be worthy of detailed discussion in relation to inheritance tax, but I shall not trespass on to that now. However, the principle of taxing recipients is sensible.<br><br>
The other principle underlying the clause, which is a reasonably virtuous one, is that it would assist in equalising benefits between husbands and wives within a marriage. It should be noted that the Government are quite keen on achieving that for outright gifts in this clause. They are rather less keen on achieving equalisation of benefits between husbands and wives in the married couple's allowance. By way of comparison only, I draw to the attention of the Financial Secretary the answer to a parliamentary question that he gave me yesterday. I has asked him what arrangements the Chancellor of the Exchequer was intending to make
<br><blockquote><p>"in order to enable those married couples who wish to share the benefits of the married couples allowance equally between them from 1990 to do so."</p></blockquote>
The answer from the Financial Secretary was directly negative. He confirmed what we know from the changes that the Government have introduced for independent taxation: the married couple's allowance will be introduced and
<br><blockquote><p>"will be given in the first instance to the husband."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 June 1989; Vol. 154, <i>c. 271.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Only if the husband cannot make full use of that allowance himself will any portion of it subsequently go to the wife. The in built disadvantage to the wife in such a relationship is worth commenting on and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
highlighting. The Government are intent on not giving equal benefit between husbands and wives in the married couple's allowance. The benefit goes principally to the husband.<br><br>
In contrast, clause 109 establishes a mechanism whereby benefits can be equalised. That must immediately lead us to ask why. The danger that Opposition Members see in clause 109 is that it makes possible an exchange of gifts in either direction between husband and wife specifically for tax avoidance purposes. As far as we can establish, it will be possible to make a gift that will produce income which will then be taxed at a lower rate than it would be in other circumstances, especially where one member of the household is in a higher tax bracket and the other member pays tax at the basic rate. That is the danger in this clause, and that is why we have tabled amendment No. 398.<br><br>
This clause excludes gifts from the settlement regulations to ensure that the tax falls on the recipient, but the exclusion of gifts is subject to qualifications. Two qualifications are already enshrined in the clause. We seek to establish a third, which is that where the gift is undertaken with the sole or main objective of achieving a tax advantage, it should not be excluded from the settlement provisions and should not be treated as income of the recipient.<br><br>
We are aware in tabling this amendment that it is difficult for the Board of Inland Revenue to establish whether an action has been taken for the
<br><blockquote><p>"sole or main objective of achieving a tax advantage."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is tabled more in a probing than in an amending spirit, because we wish to draw attention to a potential danger in clause 109. How do the Government intend to ensure that the provisions cannot be abused specifically for taxation purposes? We suspect that they cannot give a guarantee, and we should like to know their thinking. We are worried about the potential impact of some provisions and although we accept some of the underlying principles, we wish to draw attention to the problems that may arise.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that this was a probing amendment and I shall regard it as such. It is controversial and would not be popular, nor would the new-look Labour party wish to espouse it as it would undermine the very basis of independent taxation. If the amendment were carried, there would be no independence for married couples, nor would people be free to arrange their affairs as they wished.<br><br>
I shall recap on the object of clause 109 and the thinking behind it. Under the independent taxation provisions we introduced last year, a husband and wife will be taxed separately on their own incomes and each will have their own tax allowance basic rate band to set against their income. Under the present system, where the income for a married couple is all taxed as if it belonged to the husband, it is not necessary to establish how the couple's investment income is divided between the husband and wife in order to calculate the couple's total tax bill. But under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
independent taxation, the division of the income between husband and wife has to be determined so that the tax of each can be separately calculated.<br><br>
Last year, I explained that where a husband or wife makes an outright gift of assets to the other, the Government's objective was that that should be recognised for tax purposes and that the recipient, not the donor, should be taxed on any income that arises from the assets after the transfer. Provided that a gift of assets between husband and wife is free from conditions and is a complete and irrevocable transfer of the underlying capital as well as the income, we see absolutely no case for imposing a tax penalty on the income from those assets. In any case, there would be great practical difficulty in attempting to enforce such a tax penalty.<br><br>
I also explained last year that different considerations apply where arrangements fall short of an outright transfer of both income and capital. For example, where a husband seeks to divide his income from the underlying capital and to transfer only income to his wife, while retaining control over the capital, we see no reason why couples should enjoy a tax advantage from the arrangements. We shall come to that in clause 110. Our approach is not new and it follows from what we set out in the Green Paper.<br><br>
Clause 109, together with clause 110, ensures that the treatment of transfers of income between husband and wife is consistent with our general approach. Clause 109 amends the definition of a settlement for the purpose of certain of the provisions in the so-called "settlements legislation", so that it does not include an outright gift between husband and wife. That ensures that the income from an outright gift will be taxed under independent taxation as the income of the recipient of the gift. But the definition is limited. To fall within the scope fo the definition, a gift of property has to be an absolute and irrevocable transfer of both the income from the property and the underlying capital. Gifts that do not carry the right to the whole of the income from the property transferred, which are effectively transfers only of income, which are subjecto to conditions, or under which the donor may benefit directly, will not come within the scope of the provision. In those cases, the income payable to or applicable for the benefit of the donor's husband or wife will be treated as the income of the donor for all income tax purposes under the new provisions in clause 110.<br><br>
The distinction between outright gifts and gifts subject to conditions—for example, trusts, which we shall discuss under clause 110—or anything that falls short of complete transfers of both income and capital, is the right place to draw the line in deciding how the income from assets held by husband and wife should be taxed. It ensures that a married couple cannot obtain a tax advantage from a purely artifical transfer of income between them. But if the beneficial ownership of both capital and income is transferred, that genuine change of ownership will be recognised.<br><br>
The approach proposed in the amendment is different. Even if a husband or wife made a complete and irrevocable transfer of an asset to a partner, under the amendment the income from the asset
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
would continue to be taxed as the income of the donor if the transfer were made with the sole or main objective of achieving a tax advantage. Such a provision makes no sense. Independent taxation is bound to mean that some couples will transfer assets between them with the result that their total tax bill be reduced. That is an inevitable and acceptable consequence of taxing husbands and wives separately. I would have thought that Opposition Members would welcome the result, irrespective of the donor's motive, because that will lead to a more equal division of ownership of property between husbands and wives.<br><br>
I see nothing objectionable in the provision, provided that the transfers of ownership are genuine. We shall discuss under clause 10 artificial transfers through the use of trusts and the transfer of assets with specified conditions. If those tests are satisfied, it does not matter what the purpose of the transfer of assets is. If there is an outright gift, there are real financial consequences, which we must recognise. On the one hand, the recipient is free to do what he wishes with both the capital and income and, on the other hand, the donor must give up control over the assets.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury may ask about a husband and wife who merely swap cash between bank accounts. A husband and wife should be free to do that. If there is evidence of a condition being attached, that would be taken into account. But if a husband decides to give a large part of the cash in his bank account to his wife, that is his decision and, unless there is a specific legal document, he takes the risk that he may not receive the cash back. If one believes in the independence of husband and wife, that is a logical consequence and couples should be free to do so. We have made it clear that we expect income splitting to occur. However, if it is accompanied by specific conditions, the use of trusts and so on which we shall confront in clause 110, that is another matter.<br><br>
The making of outright gifts would not be undertaken lightly. Husbands and wives will wish to consider extremely carefully all the implications before giving their assets to their partner. That, as I am sure the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury recognises, will affect not only the rich. Up to 90 per cent. of married couples who are liable to tax have some investment income between them, and up to half of those are one-earner couples for whom there may be tax advantages in the transfer of assets between partners.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it would be completely inconsistent with the basic principle of independent taxation to ignore an outright gift and to pretend that it never happened. But if a transfer falls short of an outright gift, a couple should not be able to obtain tax advantages as a result.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury acknowledged that a motive test, which could be implied by his amendment, could not be operated in practice. We are not referring to complicated, artificial avoidance devices from which it might be possible to infer that the main motive was avoidance of tax. We are discussing millions of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
everyday transactions between husbands and wives. If the hon. Gentleman's amendment were carried, I cannot for the life of me imagine how he thinks the Inland Revenue would determine whether the transfer of cash between husbands' and wives' bank accounts was done for a tax motive, given the scope for millions of people to gain a marginal advantage in their tax bills. What would we do: ask them, and accept the answer yes or no? That would not be realistic.<br><br>
The provisions in the next clause referring to trusts are worth having. They are practical provisions which will prevent abuse on a more significant scale than the amendment of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury would. I accept that it was a probing amendment, but if the hon. Gentleman had said that that was what the Opposition believed, he would have undermined the very basis of independent taxation. If we are to have independent taxation, we must accept the freedom of husbands and wives to transfer assets unconditionally between them. It is not unreasonable for husbands and wives to be able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the amendment was tabled in a probing spirit, more to flag up a particular element of concern than to establish a precise mechanism with which the Inland Revenue could implement the procedure enshrined in the amendment. However, I must take issue with the Financial Secretary on his earlier remarks, which he repeated, that we seek to undermine the basis of independent taxation. Far from it. The Government have already undermined the basis of independent taxation by the mechanisms of the married couple's allowance which will be operated next year. It affects husbands and wives unequally and removes the ultimate pretence of total independence with which the Government tried to gloss their proposals when they were introduced last year.<br><br>
Two rather more justified points made by the Financial Secretary referred to the test of irrevocability enshrined in clause 109—that the gift must be an outright gift and cannot have a requirement for return built into it. That will be a protection against a tax-avoiding route. He drew attention, too, to the provisions of the succeeding clause, 110, in which matters such as the deliberate devices of establishing and settling trusts in order to transfer income and gain tax advantage at different rates of tax are covered.<br><br>
I accept the Financial Secretary's argument, although we still believe that there may be a few instances—perhaps, very few—in which gifts are given specifically for tax purposes rather than for reasons of generosity. We accept that provisos have been built in to offer considerable protection, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise one small point. We have already dealt with the substance of the clause, but on reading Butterworth's handbook on the Bill my attention was drawn to an absence of clarity in clause 109. The handbook states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is unclear as to whether regard should be taken of the possibility of propery returning the donor at the death of the donee."</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary said that the principle of irevocability is built into the provision. It may be that no specific arrangements have been made in respect of the gift returning subsequently to the donor. However, perhaps there are general provisions in the will of a deceased donee that mean that the gift will be returned subsequently to the donor. What will happen in those circumstances? The clause seems slightly unclear. I am sure that it is simply my obtuseness and that of Butterworth that is at fault, rather than the lack of precision in Government draftmanship, but it would be useful if the Minister could clarify the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some questions have been asked about this matter. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr Smith) might have been referring to property that is held jointly. If it were not held jointly, the normal tax consequences would follow. However, if it were, there would be no problem. When the recipient of a gift is either the husband or the wife, he or she is entirely free do what he or she wants to do with the assets given.<br><br>
Any decision to return the property to the donor will be a voluntary application of the property outside the terms of the settlement. That applies whether the assets return to the donor as a result of a gift by the recipient, under the recipient's will, to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred, as a result of the recipient's intestacy, or by the operation of the usual rules relating to the death of a joint life tenant. In those cases, the gift will be excluded from the relevant settlements legislation by clause 109. I hope that I have clarified the issue. I shall study the hon. Gentleman's remarks and if there is anything further that I should add, I shall inform him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that clarifies the issue, but there is a slight problem. The Financial Secretary described a subsequent decision by the donee—say, making a will, such that if the donee predeceases the donor, thereby in effect returning the gift, that would be a voluntary decision. But when the donee dies intestate, it could be argued that the return was not a voluntary decision of the donee. I understand that the Financial Secretary said that, once the gift was made, whatever subsequently happens to it by reason of the donee's death is irrelevant to the provisions of clause 109. However, after studying the points that have been made and heard the slight worry that I have on the issue, I am sure that the Financial Secretary will give further clarification if necessary.</span></p>

SETTLEMENTS WHERE SETTLOR RETAINS INTEREST IN SETTLED PROPERTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause, as I explained in the previous debate, reduces the tax advantages which can be obtained by using trusts and other settlements to transfer income from one person to another. It changes the income tax treatment of some settlements where the person who made the settlement, or the husband or wife of that person, is able to benefit from the settlement income or capital.<br><br>
Most income from settlements where the settlor, or the husband or wife of the settlor, is able to benefit is already treated as the settlor's for all tax purposes. But in some cases the income is treated as the income of the settlor only for the purposes of tax at the difference between the higher and basic rates. For basic rate, the income continues to be taxed as belonging to the beneficiary to whom it is paid. So, if he or she has unused personal allowances which could be set against that income, a tax advantage can be gained by claiming a repayment. The clause will end that advantage.<br><br>
The clause does two things. First, it prevents people from giving assets to their spouse while retaining control of their capital, but allowing their partner to benefit from the income. It does so through artificial devices such as trusts. Secondly, the clause prevents people from using trusts in the way that non-charitable trusts were used.<br><br>
Last year we abolished the use of non-charitable covenants for the transfer of income to other people especially to students. That affects people in middle-income ranges. Our proposals on trusts will ensure that the very wealthy cannot use a similar device to that which we blocked last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome clause 110. The clause seeks to ensure that settlement income is decided and taxed as the settlor's income in all cases. It closes a loophole, and we are glad that the Government have taken this step.</span></p>

RELIEF FOR PRE-TRADING EXPENDITURE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Section 401 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 gives relief for expenditure incurred by an individual, partnership or company before the start of a trade if that expenditure would have been allowable as a business expense if the trade had already started. The relief covers the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
cost of rent, rates or employing staff. In order to confine claims to expenditure directly connected with the setting up of the trade, relief is at present restricted to qualifying expenditure incurred within three years before trading starts. Clause 113 extends that to five years.<br><br>
There have been several representations that the current three-year time limit may be unduly restrictive. The extension to five years is intended to recognise the longer lead times which may be necessary for large-scale infrastructure projects that seem likely to become increasingly common in the late 1980s and 1990s. The extension reflects the Government's continuing policy of encouraging private sector involvement in major construction projects. The new relief will be available to individuals, partnerships and companies that start to trade on or after 1 April 1989. The existing three-year period should already cover the bulk of free trading expenditure. The cost of extending the time limit to five years is likely to be negligible, building up in later years to some tens of millions of pounds, but that is difficult to assess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to note the slight change of emphasis in the Government's explanation of the clause during the past three or four months. The Inland Revenue issued a press release on Budget day in relation to the decision to provide extended relief for pre-trading expenditure. That press release made the point that the Financial Secretary made—that the relief given when trading begins will apply where it is available for the cost of taking on employees or rent or rates. It gave exactly the same examples that the Financial Secretary has given and explained that the clause was designed to assist firms involved in high technology where large amounts had to be spent on research and development prior to the start of trading. That was clearly set out in the Inland Revenue's press release, and was much to be welcomed.<br><br>
However, the Financial Secretary now tells us that in relation to the clause he has in mind the sector of industry involved in large-scale infrastructure projects. I understand the Government's thinking in each instance. I appreciate the importance of research and development in the high technology sector and the importance of long lead times in the establishment of large infrastructure projects. We are entitled to ask the Government to get their act together and decide whether they have in mind one or the other, or both. Both sectors of industry are worth supporting. We might have differences about the amount of large-scale infrastructure work that the Government seek to place with the private sector rather than to carry out form within the public sector. Nonetheless, we welcome the forward development of both sectors of British industry.<br><br>
If this easing of the taxation arrangements—which applies not to capital, but only to revenue—will assist such industries to get off the ground and such firms to get established, it is to be welcomed. We shall not oppose the clause, but we want to know whether the Government's mind has changed during the past three months, or whether they have both causes in mind in bringing forward this clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will apply to both, although I am not sure that that matters very much. As the hon. Gentleman said, we did mention research and development in the press release—only five words in a long press release. The measure will apply to both sectors. We have had representations from industry that it will be beneficial. Precisely on which sector it will fall is a secondary question, but I guess that it will be of more value in the infrastructure sector.</span></p>

SUB-CONTRACTORS: REGULATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamont</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause, and clause 115, involve the special tax scheme for subcontractors in the construction industry. Because of the history of widespread tax abuse in parts of the construction industry, a special scheme was introduced in 1971 requiring contractors to make a deduction at source form payments made to subcontractors who do not hold an Inland Revenue exemption certificate. Those who hold one can be paid gross, but most must provide a voucher—a form of receipt—to the contractor for each payment. The contractor in turn passes the vouchers to the Revenue who can use them to check the subcontractor's and the contractor's accounts at the end of the tax year.<br><br>
The scheme was revised in 1975 and has remained basically unchanged since then, but with the changing work patterns and the boom in the building industry, we decided that it was time to look again at the scheme.<br><br>
We have concluded that a special regime for subcontractors in the construction industry remains an important defence against significant tax evasion, about which the Public Accounts Committee and others have voiced concern. The Inland Revenue is implementing a number of internal procedural changes which we hope will improve efficiency without damaging the security of the scheme.<br><br>
We also thought it desirable to consult the construction industry on other ideas which would have an impact on it. With my approval, the Inland Revenue issued on Budget Day a consultative document entitled, "Subcontractors Scheme: Reducing Paperwork", which suggested changes to speed up and simplify the administrative arrangements. The main objective was to cut down on the ever-increasing volume of paperwork.<br><br>
As a result of these consultations, we shall bring in regulations with effect from next April to allow contractors to send to the Revenue the vouchers they receive from their subcontractors on a montly basis, rather than the present weekly basis, and to send subcontractors their documents directly, rather than via tax offices with the delay that that entails.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
We are also considering representations about a number of anomalies, and may make appropriate changes under existing powers.<br><br>
The consultative document proposed that instead of returning a voucher for each payment, small payments could be aggregated, with a voucher being returned every £2,500. Clause 114 simply enables regulations to be made to do that.<br><br>
There is strong support for the principle of aggregating small payments on to one voucher. But a common reaction from the building industry is that the form of aggregation proposed is too complicated and does not fit into the range of the construction industry's administrative arrangements. It has been suggested that aggregating over time rather than by value would be simpler and would save the industry costs.<br><br>
Other more radical suggestions were made which might lead to the replacement of vouchers by a different set of safeguards. This might involve a monthly return to the Revenue by the contractor similar to the present annual return, which could show the aggregate payment in the period to each subcontractor. Gross payments could be obtained only where money was transferred directly into a nominated account held by the subcontractor and known to the Revenue. Cash payments would have to be made under deduction. Such a proposal is much more radical than a development of the present voucher regime.<br><br>
Since our proposals were intended to save administrative work for the industry as well as the Revenue, we must take account of the industry's views. However, I must ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the integrity of the scheme against evasion, and deregulation and administrative savings.<br><br>
The consultative document contained a number of other matters, including the introduction of a £10,000 upper limit on the amount that may be put on the voucher—which is also dealt with by clause 114—and possible changes to the deduction scheme paperwork. Such matters interact with the wider proposals, including those from the industry, and, in the light of the industry's reaction, it seems sensible to defer action while we consider the proposals. For that reason, I suggest that this clause and clause 115, which provides a new deduction at source sanction if aggregate vouchers are not submitted, should not stand part of the Bill. That will not, however, affect our taking forward the other matters that will reduce the weight of work on both the industry and the Revenue.<br><br>
As we have received many representations from the industry stating that our proposals will not achieve what we intended—which was to reduce the burden on the industry—I propose to withdraw the clauses. Obviously, we shall consult with the industry on the other matters that I outlined in my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a highly unusual step for the Government to be proposing to vote against a clause—which they have placed in the Bill—standing part of the Bill. The representations that they received
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0235">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
from the building industry must have been considerable to bring about such a change of heart.<br><br>
The original deadline set by the Government for the consultation period on the two clauses and on their announcement that they were considering changing the subcontractors' system was 31 May. It is obvious that either the consultation is still proceeding or the volume of material that has been submitted during the consultation period has been far greater than the Government anticipated. Incidentally, the Financial Secretary referred to the building industry in terms which seemed to imply that the Government were taking notice only of the employers' side. I hope and trust that the Government are also consulting the trade union side, which has been at the forefront of trying to eliminate the exploitation of both workers and the taxation system that much subcontracting in the construction industry has traditionally represented. I hope that the Government will give us an assurance that the consultation is not simply with employers' interests, but also with bodies representing the workers. I am pleased to see the Financial Secretary nodding in agreement at that.<br><br>
Obviously, we support any mechanism that would reduce the administrative complexities for all those involved in the industry while maintaining the safeguards for the Revenue that are extremely important and which too great a relaxation of the subcontractors' system might put in jeopardy. We do not want to quibble with what the Government are doing. We hope that their consultation will be widespread and that when they introduce changes they will be constructive changes that make life easier for those involved in the industry but do not defraud the Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we can agree that no member of this Committee, myself included, has an interest in promoting the evasion of tax whether in the building industry—where it has occurred more often than it should—or in any other industry. Equally, we all have an interest in promoting efficient and effective administration. I had the opportunity for the first time to sit in on the taxation committee of the Building Employers Confederation just over two weeks ago, deputising for a colleague, and it was clear then that the consultative document and the Government's response to it had not answered all the problems of the industry and that the jury was still out on some of the details.</span></p>

Conservative Members are just as quashed here and it is hotter and less convenient. Would you

consider moving the sittings of the Committee back to the Committee Corridor where it is far more convenient for hon. Members?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may recall that the removal was agreed and carried out under the chairmanship of my co-Chairman. I should be reluctant to undermine his authority by moving us back. I understand the problem. It is quite obvious from where I sit that it is difficult for Conservative Members. There is a lack of space. The problem arises from the number of hon. Members on the Committee. I have never known a Committee as large as this in all my time in the House. That is not under my control. I understand the problem. I am sorry about the inconveniences but there is little that I can do about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crowther.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crowther. When your co-Chairman announced that we would move to this room he said that it would be for the next two weeks at least. This is the second of those two weeks. We will have had a two-week experiment in this Committee room and I think that I speak for quite a number of my hon. Friends in saying that the experiment has failed. There is only one sitting when there is a problem with Room 10—the first sitting on Thursday afternoons. But for the two sittings on Tuesdays and the later sitting on Thursdays there is no problem. Room 10 is bigger. More space is available to members of the Committee. I hope that we may be able to reconsider the experiment for next week and perhaps move back to Room 10, even if it means one short session in Room 9.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to do anything I can for the convenience of the Committee. If the general view of hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to what I take to have been a point of order, Mr. Crowther. We agreed that we would experiment with this Room, and that the experiment would be up this Thursday.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my speech has already been somewhat protracted by external events, I shall hasten to conclude it. However, our recent exchanges make the point for me. In matter of sensitivity and importance, to do with the place of sitting for Members of the Committee or subcontractors' certificates in the case of the building industry, it is better to consult, to take time and to achieve the right and agreed solution. For that reason I welcome the Government's initiative in seeking to leave the clauses at present. Within the next 12 months it should be possible to produce a solution which is both more acceptable to the building industry, and likely to bring in revenue more effectively. I support the Financial Secretary in seeking to leave the clauses.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 88, line 36, leave out from "made" to the end of line 43 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"on or after 25th October 1988."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall also consider amendment No. 399, in page 88, line 37, leave out from "time" to end of line 43.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most hon. Members probably harbour a desire to be considered an expert on something, and it is generally possible for us to become so, if the compass of the subject matter is sufficiently small. It so happens that the clause, which is concerned with an article of the United States of America-United Kingdom double taxation treaty, would be my chosen special subject if in due course I were to become a contestant on the "Mastermind" programme. In a previous incarnation as a member of the tax Bar, this was one of the subjects of great interest to me.<br><br>
I once wrote a book, a rather charming little volume which I happen to have with me, which was in its day regarded as one of the great tomes of reference upon this somewhat arcane topic. I appreciate that the colour may no longer appeal to some hon. Members.<br><br>
In the clause, the Government seek to reverse the High Court decision in the case of the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation v. Critchely—not our hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Critchley), but an inspector of taxes. In that case, which was about the amount of the withholding tax that is due to the Inland Revenue when a foreign parent company with a UK subsidiary derives dividends from this country, there was an argument over the exact amount due. The taxpayer contended that it was less and the inspector of taxes maintained that it was more. That is what the litigation was about.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
However, we are concerned not with the subject matter of the case but with the way in which the Government seek to amend the law to reverse the decision given on that case.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
It has been a cardinal principle that a taxpayer is entitled to order his affairs to his best advantage, provided that he complies with the law. A substantial tax avoidance industry grew up in the 1970s that led to the granting of wide discretions to the Inland Revenue to cancel tax advantages, but no artificial avoidance scheme is involved in this case. We are dealing with the construction of an article in the double taxation treaty by the court. The Government take the view that the court's decision on the meaning of the article was not what the Government meant when they concluded the treaty with the United States and they now seek to restore the position to what they originally thought it was.<br><br>
Parliament is entitled to close loopholes in the law if the Government's objectives are not entirely achieved in their legislation. No one can object to that, but the clause applies not simply prospectively, but retrospectively. Apart from the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation, everyone will be subject to the legislation. The provision will apply across the board, even though some taxpayers have instituted appeals against Inland Revenue assessments on an identical basis to that which was successfully submitted by the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation. I add that in my capacity as a tax expert, I have advised an oil company that stands to benefit if my amendment is accepted, but I realise from the Opposition amendment that we are unlikely to be ad idem across the Committee. As I also gather that the Government are not wholly convinced of the merits of my case, my involvement may not be relevant.<br><br>
We should tackle the problem of retrospective legislation. Wade and Phillips, the standard work on constitutional law, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"to change the character of past transactions carried out on the faith of the then existing law is repugnant to the conception of the rule of law."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry that the Opposition's amendment takes issue with what, in civilised society, would be regarded as commonplace, but I hope that my right hon. and hon Friends and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) will accept the proposition.<br><br>
Two years ago even the Opposition accepted the proposition. The hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), who was the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman in 1987 when we debated a similar provision involving the Jersey double taxation treaty, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament should oppose retrospective legislation, for a number of reasons. The principal democratic reason is that people are perfectly entitled to do whatever the law permits them to do and that it is wrong afterwards to make it unlawful. … but the basic principle upon which people operate in our society is that they are entitled to take legislation at its face value, as determined by a court, for the time being."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 15 July 1987; Vol. 119, col. 1175.]</p></blockquote>
That is an estimable argument and I am sorry that the Opposition no longer accept that thinking.<br><br>

In debates on Finance Bills introduced by Labour Governments, Conservative senior spokesmen took a different view from that which I suspect that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary will take today. During the debates on the 1978 Finance Bill, my right hon. and learned Friend who is now the Foreign Secretary spoke about the problem of retrospection. The then Labour Government were introducing the anti-tax avoidance clauses to which I alluded earlier. My right hon. and learned Friend stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The more usual way"—</p></blockquote>
of dealing with the problems that the then Government faced—
<br><blockquote><p>"is to have nothing to do with retrospectivity at all and to outlaw the provision, as in an ordinary Finance Bill, with the provision dating back only to the date of the Budget resolution."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The second course is that it should be retrospective to the date of the clear announcement of a specific intention to propose particular legislation"—</p></blockquote>
that is, by means of a Revenue press release or ministerial statement and so on. My right hon. and learned Friend then continued?
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a particularly British approach to the problem."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 July 1978; Vol. 953, c. 1633.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed that the real significance of that contribution was that in 1978 the then shadow Chancellor was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Finance Bill and was contributing to its proceedings? Has my hon. Friend also noticed a departure in recent years from the admirable precedent that was set on that occasion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's support for the amendment. He made an important point, but my intention is not to be nasty to Opposition Members. I do not wish to upset the consensus of good behaviour that we have enjoyed in our proceedings, so I shall reject my hon. Friend's tempting invitation to become controversial.<br><br>
The Inland Revenue announced in a press release dated 25 October 1988 that the clause would be introduced. Until that date, no one knew that the decision of the court on 31 August 1988 would be reversed. Yet the clause will backdate the reversal of the court's decision to 1975 when the treaty came into effect.<br><br>
Lord Rees, whom members of the Committee remember with affection as a very successful Chief Secretary and under whose leadership I served on more than one Standing Committee considering previous Finance Bills, enunciated the Rees rules on the circumstances in which legislative provisions with retrospective effect may be considered acceptable. He said that four conditions should be observed.<br><br>
First, a precise warning must be given to taxpayers of the intention to legislate. Secondly, the problem at which the warning was directed should be referred immediately to a tax reform committee for consideration by the professions and the Inland Revenue. Thirdly, if that committee could devise an appropriate legislative provision, a draft should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
published immediately to give a clear intimation to those likely to be affected. Finally, such a clause must, without fail, be introduced in the following Finance Bill.<br><br>
The Government have not observed all those requirements in introducing the clause. Warning was not given to all taxpayers who will be affected and those who knew the implications of the Inland Revenue's ambiguous comments will be affected prospectively and retrospectively. The warnings were not reduced to a specific form. Although the Government have introduced the provision in the Finance Bill, the Rees rules were not observed in some important circumstances.<br><br>
Two years ago we considered a similar case. On that occasion, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said that he did not like what he was obliged to do and that he felt uncomfortable in that position. That is probably why my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is doing the job today. I am sure that he feels, like my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, that it is not something that we enjoy doing. We on the Conservative Benches must think carefully before we endorse the Government's proposals.<br><br>
If clause 116 is enacted, we shall be restoring the general understanding of the law as it was before the decision of the Union Texas case. We shall be saying that it is the Inland Revenue's understanding of the law which is the law. The Revenue will say that the law means X and the taxpayer will say that it is Y. If the taxpayer succeeds in a court of law and the Revenue loses, at the end of the day the Revenue will win because the Government will reverse the effect of the decision.<br><br>
I know that a substantial amount of money is involved. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary says that £70 million is potentially at risk, but we must decide the price of principle.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Foreign Secretary, in the debate in 1978 to which I referred earlier said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Of course, it is possible to sympathise with the tax collectors and those who draft our laws. They will often seek to justify their case by showing a huge loss of revenue, but I do not believe that the House regards this approach as justifiable."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 July 1978; Vol. 957, c. 1636.]</p></blockquote>
I entirely agreed with my right hon. and learned Friend in 1978 and I do not believe that the measure of the rightness of the cause should be the amount of money at stake.<br><br>
I recall the story of George Bernard Shaw sitting at dinner one night with a beautiful actress, talking about prostitution. She was trying to give the impression of being terribly broadminded, and George Bernard Shaw asked whether she would ever sell her body for money and whether she would sleep with him if he offered her £1,000. She said that she thought she would, so he asked whether she would do so if he offered her 4½d. She said, "What kind of a woman do you take me for?", to which he replied, "We have already decided that, and we are now merely haggling over the price."<br><br>
The Government are placing themselves in a dangerous position. There are serious objections to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0238">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
their proposals. By unilaterally amending the double taxation treaty, which is a treaty between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, we are seeking to withdraw unilaterally the rights of citizens of another country. There is an important distinction between this case and the Padmore case, which involved United Kingdom resident partners of a Jersey partnership. In the Padmore case, we were dealing with our own residents in a Jersey tax haven, whereas the United States is one of our most important trading partners. I believe that the correct way to plug the gap in the double tax treaty is by means of protocol, not by a clause in the Finance Bill.<br><br>
It was not only the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation which appealed against the determinations of the Inland Revenue. Many other taxpayers would be entitled to the same tax rebates as that corporation, and their cases were stayed, pending the outcome of the Union Texas case which was to be regarded as a test case.<br><br>
On 15 January 1988, the inspector of foreign dividends wrote to one oil company saying that notice of appeal against the determination could be given. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Such an appeal will be held over pending the outcome of the action being brought by the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation."</p></blockquote>
The invitation was to not proceed with the appeal because the outcome of that case was being awaited. It was repeated on 22 February in identical words. On 5 May, when another application for a rebate was made in respect of the next quarter, the Revenue put a gloss on that sentence:
<br><blockquote><p>"But I should make clear that I can give no assurance that the determination of the appeal will necessarily follow that in the Union Texas case."</p></blockquote>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I do not know that was meant by that sentence, because if the High Court decided that the important words in the treaty meant "X", other courts, especially special commissioners below the courts, would be obliged to follow the High Court's decision.<br><br>
I do not know why the Inland Revenue could not give an assurance that the determination of other appeals would follow the decision of the High Court, unless it meant that such a decision might be overturned in the Court of Appeal. An appeal is still pending in the Court of Appeal in respect of the Union Texas case, so perhaps that is what the Revenue meant.<br><br>
The deputy manager of Mobil UK Group Tax, the company concerned, sought further clarification of the issue. He wrote to the Inland Revenue, stating:
<br><blockquote><p>"I should be grateful if you could expand upon your comment; it would appear to suggest that, in some way which I do not understand, we could be prejudiced if we agree as we have for earlier years, to our Appeal remaining on the 'pending' file."</p></blockquote>
In response, the Revenue inspector stated that that did not represent a change in the position that was set out in earlier correspondence. He said that he would not be taking steps to have any appeals against decisions heard by the commissioners until the Union Texas case was out of the way. He went on:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"I can give no assurance that the determination of those appeals will necessarily follow that in the Union Texas case."</p></blockquote>
The Inland Revenue simply repeated what it had said previously.<br><br>
The deputy manager of the company wrote back to the Revenue saying that he could only repeat that the fact that the Inland Revenue by not proceeding to have those appeals heard by commissioners pending the outcome of the Union Texas case, should not be taken as it giving any commitment that the determination of the appeals would necessarily follow that in the Union Texas case.<br><br>
At no stage did the Inland Revenue explain that it intended to overturn the decision of the court if it went against the Revenue. In cases when it is possible for taxpayers to seek to have their appeals progressed to a decision, they are held back in the confident expectation that the effect of the Union Texas case will apply to them. If the taxpayer win, they will receive their rebates. It is highly objectionable that taxpayers should be placed in such an invidious position, when they decide not to proceed further with cases on the advice of the Revenue because they expect that a test case decision will apply to them.<br><br>
What will happen if such circumstances occur in future? Conservative Members believe in the principle of first-past-the-post as the basis of our electoral system. But if such a principle is the only winner in court cases, especially tax cases, the Inland Revenue will be faced by many taxpayers champing at the bit to go to court first and obtain the first decision as they will be the only people who can confidently expect to benefit from the court's decision. Such behaviour is not in the interests of the Inland Revenue any more than it is in the interests of taxpayers.<br><br>
Opposition Members probably take heart from such a saga of events. It seems that they have now moved to a position in which retrospection is likely to be the order of the day. Therefore, I shall be disappointed if Conservative Members do anything to weaken the convention that inclines us against retrospection. After all, we have no written constitution. Parliament, which is, in effect, composed of the Government of the day, cannot be stopped from doing what it wants, except in rare instances. If—God forbid—a Labour Government are elected in future, they might introduce draconian, confiscatory measures of taxation that apply retrospectively. By accepting the clause as drafted, we shall not just open the lid of Pandora's box a chink to see what is inside; we shall open it completely and give the key to the Opposition.<br><br>
I should not go as far as a former Conservative Front-Bench spokesman went in earlier debates on retrospective legislation—Lord Jenkin of Roding. He opposed the War Damage Act 1965 which was introduced by a Labour Government to take away from the Burmah oil company the effect of a decision of the House of Lords on compensation for war damage from the second world war. That seems apposite to any case of retrospectivity. Lord Jenkin said the legislation
<br><blockquote><p>"will be another nail in the coffin of the rule of law … further undesirable precedent to be added to the existing list of undesirable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
precedents and, thereby, a further bad example to younger territories"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 2 March 1965; Vol. 707, c. 1264.]</p></blockquote>
—and other political parties—
<br><blockquote><p>"which are only too eager to seize upon bad precedents that they can use as examples."</p></blockquote>
As Conservatives, we should oppose the principle of retrospectivity. Although a substantial sum of money is at issue, it is small in the context of the global funds derived annually by the Revenue from tax revenue. The Treasury is so awash with money at the moment that it is difficult to know what to do with it. This is not the right moment to indulge in such proposals. Will my right hon. Friend reconsider the Government's proposal and, if not remove the clause from the Bill, limit its effect to the date at which the Inland Revenue press release was published?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Townend</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who has dealt fully with the arguments. Retrospectivity is a matter of principle. I am especially perturbed because this is the second such clause to have been brought before this Committee in the past two years. The last time, it was the case of Padmore, mentioned by my hon. Friend. On that occasion, I was critical of the Government introducing retrospective legislation at the behest of the Inland Revenue. I said on the Floor of the House that if the legislation were passed, it would not be the last time that it happened. I am afraid that what I said has come true.<br><br>
When a matter is decided in court, it is wrong in principle for the Revenue to persuade the Government to change the legislation, not for future activities, but to cover previous ones. Only one body then benefits from the court decision. All pending cases should be included. I strongly urge my right hon. Friend to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This could be described as the Union Texas clause. It is interesting that this is the first time in our proceedings that long and passionate interventions have been made by Conservative Back Benchers. It is noticeable that those interventions have been made on behalf of parts of the corporate sector that are not short of a penny or two to argue their own case.<br><br>
Amendment No. 399 seeks to do the opposite of amendment No. 163, tabled by the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). The Government are stuck in the middle between the two amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's opening remarks gave me pause for thought. I wish to make it clear that many Conservative Members regard themselves as passionate, but none regard themselves as easily bought by corporate clients, whose only influence on Conservatives is the power of their arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refrain from taking up the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) that, far from being easily bought, Conservative Members may be expensively bought. It would be unworthy of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
me to say that. We should consider exactly what is involved. It was noticeable that the hon. Members for Tatton and for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) talked almost entirely about the principle of retrospection, but did not discuss the precise measures in the clause, which are dated according to the principles that the Government put forward.<br><br>
The decision of Union Texas Petroleum Corporation <i>v.</i> Critchley held that under the amount of withholding tax that the tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom prescribes, the withholding tax on ACT refunds to an American parent of a British company should be calculated on the Act actually repair rather than, as the Inland Revenue had always assumed, on the amount repayable before the deduction of the withholding tax. The difference between those two versions is not enormous in any one individual case. Marginal amounts are involved between the Union Texas decision version and the version that will exist under clause 116. The difference is in the calculation of ACT refunds to the United States parent.<br><br>
I was puzzled by the hon. Member for Tatton saying that £70 million was at risk in relation to the clause. Will the Economic Secretary confirm whether that figure is correct? The Red Book makes no reference to that change or to any loss or advantage to the Exchequer that will result from it. The figure of £70 million seems high and must relate to substantial funds in consideration for ACT refunds. It would be useful to know the precise amounts at stake.<br><br>
The August 1988 Union Texas case decision reversed what the Inland Revenue hasd assumed to obtain. Through this clause, the Inland Revenue is now trying to reinstate what it thought the provisions of the treaty were. That involves the important point about retrospection. The hon. Member for Tatton appears to to be arguing that retrospective legislation in tax matters is never acceptable. We cannot accept that. Retrospective legislation may be worthy of consideration in exceptional circumstances. We have discussed that in relation to previous clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arbuthnot</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In an earlier speech made by the hon. Gentleman on Second Reading, I intervened and he kindly gave way then, too. I asked him whether he approved of retrospective legislation and, if so, where it would end. I did not feel that I received a satisfactory answer on that occasion. I look forward to one now, particularly as I understand that his amendment would overturn a decision of a court by retrospective legislation many months after the event.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the best definitions of when retrospective fiscal legislation is deemed acceptable was given by the Financial Secretary during our debates in the Chamber in the clauses relating to close company structure and the business expansion scheme. He said that, to enable retrospection to be considered, there should have been some abuse of the tax system, and the devices entered upon by individuals or companies should not have been intended by the Government or Parliament when enacting previous financial legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
Two principles seem discernable from what the Financial Secretary was saying. First, the Exchequer was being defrauded of income by some abuse of procedure. Secondly, although all reasonable interpretation of the legislation should have been understood as everyone expected, someone found a way of getting around that reasonable interpretation. That seems to be precisely what has happened here. The Union Texas judgment overturned everyone's assumptions. The Government are now trying to reestablish what the original assumption was.<br><br>
The applicable date has now to be decided for such a decision. If the hon. Member for Tatton has his way, the applicable date for re-establishing what people had assumed was the status quo would be the date of the passage of this Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The date in my amendment refers to the Inland Revenue's press release on 25 October 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. He is correct in that respect and in that respect alone. The operable date would be 25 October. But he would deny the possibility, which the Government seek to enshrine in their clause, of appeal proceedings that have been set in train subsequently changing the provision.<br><br>
Our proposal—we advance it not in a dogmatic spirit but because we are not absolutely certain that the Government have got it right—is that the reinstated status quo—if I may describe it as such—should be applicable to all cases. We accept that there is a problem in seeking to legislate effectively to overturn a court decision. That is why I have no intention of advising my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division. We do not wish to endorse that as a general principle.<br><br>
We tabled the amendment because questions must be asked about the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation case. Union Texas was part of Allied Chemical. I am not sure whether it still is—the Government may have more up-to-date information than I have Union Texas held interests in a number of North sea platforms and oil establishments, including the Piper Alpha platform. The profits against which the decision of the Union Texas court case was taken in August 1988 may have derived in part from those North sea oil establishments.<br><br>
It seems odd that we are considering instating extremely generous fiscal arrangements for companies making profits out of North sea oil when the same rigour has not necessarily been applied to the safety of those establishments. We should not simply be generous in our treatment of company profits; we should also be generous about the safety of the workers in those companies.<br><br>
The amendment has been tabled in a probing, rather than an assertive spirit. We do not accept the arguments made by the hon. Member for Tatton against retrospection. Retrospection should be used carefully. The Government are right to use partial retospection in clause 116. They could probably have gone a bit further, which is why we tabled the amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
We do not accept that everyone will rush to be first in the queue with a test case. If something is wrong with the existing legislation, it should be put right at the earliest opportunity. The Government are seeking to do that, which is right. They could be a little stricter with Union Texas and others, although I doubt that they will be. None the less, we urge the Minister to resist wholeheartedly the efforts of his hon. Friend the Member for Tatton to represent the vested interests of the corporate sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was uncharacteristically mealy-mouthed and obfuscatory in his comments, snatching arguments from wherever he could in an attempt to defend the largely indefensible principle that the Government can turn the law around after they have discovered that it is not what they thought that it was.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) made a speech that had the disarming quality of leading me to agree with him almost entirely, an experience that he and I have not previously shared. I thought that the hon. Gentleman spoke clearly, effectively and correctly. He drew attention to the way that the Government's proposals discriminate between taxpayers. He enunciated the principle—also relevant to an earlier debate—that the taxpayer should know what the law is.<br><br>
Another relevant principle is that the law should treat taxpayers equally and not discriminate between them, apart from their liability to tax. Yet the clause treats those taxpayers who did not successfully conclude a court case against the Inland Revenue—for which the Inland Revenue has never forgiven them—differently from the taxpayers who took the case to court. As well as having the absurd effect of inciting other taxpayers to be first in the queue to take their case to the courts in future, more generally, it discriminates against those who are nor directly involved in the litigation. Effective litigation defines what the law is. The fact that the result was not what the Inland Revenue wanted it to be does not entitle it then to treat other taxpayers as though the law was what it thought it was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is a question not only of what the Inland Revenue though the law was but of what Parliament thought the law was intended to do? Does he also accept that the Government are seeking to make the principal start date the date on which they announced that they were to seeek changes of legislation rather than the court date?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not enunciate a new principle of constitutional law—that the law is what Parliament thought it was going to be. That is precisely not what the law is in this country. The law is what it says, as interpreted by the courts. Indeed, it has long been argued that were it otherwise, judges would go on circuit with entire collections of <i>Hansard</i> from the Conquest onwards in their equipment in order to divine what Parliament thought it was. That would be an impossible task, so the law is what it says as interpreted by the courts.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
If the law proves to be not what either the Government or Parliament thought it was, the Government have the opportunity to change the law. The undesirable principle is that they should do so in such a way as to change the character of transactions after they were carried out. That principle is most notably undesirable in those cases where it is to the detriment of the taxpayer.<br><br>
Other retrospective legislation which is supposed to be to the benefit of the individual concerned is going through the House at present. I refer to the "Police (Essential Functions) Bill", which is retrospective in respect of penalties that might otherwise have arisen in circumstances that were not envisaged. This is the opposite way round. The taxpayer is the person who is placed at a disadvantage in this instance. Even more disturbing than the fact that it is retrospective in its disadvantageous impact on the taxpayer is the principle—or breach of principle—that treats taxpayers differently and regards those who were not directly involved and the beneficiaries of the litigation as being in a category different from those who were. I do not see how the Government can defend that principle and they should abandon any attempt to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said that the had, for him, the unusual experience of agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). I have equally unusual experience of disagreeing with my hon. Friend, with whom I normally agree entirely, it is particularly daunting to do so, both because of my hon. Friend's great skill and learning in debate and because in this case it is rather like finding oneself in a "Mastermind" contest when one is asked to compete on the other contestant's choice of special subject.<br><br>
It was particularly horrifying for me to discover that my hon. Friend has written a book on the subject and was prepared to flash it around. I have not written any book on this subject. However, I have written a book and I used to be as daring as him and would flash it around and offer to sign copies and sell people a first edition. I would say, "Valuable signed first edition—take one," until on one occasion someone shouted out from the back, "Not as valuable as a second edition." So I gave up that practice, but I am sure that my hon. Friend's book has gone into many editions.<br><br>
Unlike my hon. Friend I am no expert on the subject. Indeed, the only exams that I have ever failed are my tax exams, which is why they made me a Treasury Minister. I do have an excuse: because of my bride's illness, I got married on the same day. It caused some confusion to the verger when I said that I was having to come straight to the wedding from my exams. He said, "Good God, I knew these modern women were demanding but I didn't know they made you sit exams." It was, however, tax exams that I sat and failed on that day. I subsequently passed, but not on this issue.<br><br>
More seriously, retrospection is, as the Committee recognises, a sensitive matter. Retrospection, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
normally understood, is anathema to Conservative Members, and indeed to the whole of Parliament. Normally retrospection is a question of unsettling what was previously settled and widely understood. That is why it is horrifying, because it takes away from people the certainty on which they were basing, and felt that they could continue to base, their arrangements—commercial, personal or otherwise.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
In this case we are not doing that. We are restoring the law to that degree of certainty and settled understanding on which most people thought it had rested since 1975. It restores the law to what everybody, before the Union Texas case, thought it was. It restores the law to how it was explained by United States Governments in their technical guidance notes to their taxpayers, explaining how the law works. As far as I know, no one expressed any view similar to those which emerged in the Union Texas litigation, apart from Union Texas. If we did not make the change, we would be giving a windfall benefit, entirely unexpected, to those who would benefit retrospectively—benefit which would amount to some £70 million of taxpayers' money. I confirm to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) that that is the total sum involved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton feels that we are widening the precedent set by the Padmore case in a previous Finance Bill, but we are not. This is a significantly narrower use of retrospection than in the Padmore case. In Padmore, some taxpayers allege that they challenged the Revenue's view of what the law was before the court hearing. In this case none challenged the Revenue's view before the Union Texas litigation. As I said, the United States Government, the other party to the tax agreement, agreed with us on the interpretation of the law.<br><br>
In the Padmore case, certain co-litigants listed their appeals, or their interest in the case, before the main litigation began. In this case, none attempted to list their interest in the case until more than a year after the court hearing by Union Texas. In the Padmore case, the inspector specifically agreed to link those with three litigants and 112 partners who had indicated an interest and joint interest in the litigation before the case began. In this case, no one expressed an interest uintil more than a year after the hearing, and the inspector then made it clear that he would not guarantee the same treatment to others who wished to pursue appeals on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister I have to confess I am not an expert in the field. Would he say that the Institute of Chartered Accountants' brief on the topic is so much rubbish? It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the past, considerable duplication of work and administration has been avoided where taxpayers (as with the Union Texas case) awaited the outcome of a single appeal to establish a point of principle. The inevitable consequence of this trend in legislation will be to increase enormously the number of appeals being taken to litigation as taxpayers seek to protect their legitimate rights."</p></blockquote>
Would the Minister say that that brief is not worth the paper it is written on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a minute. The Union Texas case is narrower than the Padmore

case, which was agreed by the previous Finance Committee and the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton assumed that all retrospection is the same; that it is always bad, that we should do nothing retrospective as a matter of principle, and that we should not examine why retrospection is bad. He maintained that people should be able to plan their affairs with certainty. Indeed, my hon. Friend thinks that we should avoid retrospection even if it means that court cases must be allowed a retrospective effect when the court rules that the law is otherwise than everyone had previously thought. That upturns the familiar and settled way. My hon. Friend says that there is no objection to that in this case because taxpayers will benefit from that changed judgment, but what if a court were to rule that an understanding of the law had been wrong and that taxpayers had paid too little tax? Would my hon. Friend say, "Let justice be done until the heavens fall"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The courts do not change the law; we do that by legislation. Courts interpret the law. Because people have regarded the law as being X when a later court rules that it is Y does not mean that the law is changed. It is merely being clarified and determined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's distinction, but I am not sure that he has appreciated my simile between a court ruling, which in this case was to the unexpected benefit of taxpayers, and one that would rule to the unexpected disadvantage of taxpayers. In the latter case, we do not reopen assessments and payments made by taxpayers; we allow them to have the benefit of what turns out to be an unduly favourable interpretation of the law if the court subsequently rules that it should have been harsher. So there is some symmetry in the process that we are adopting today.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton and the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that is we did not extend the benefit that we are allowing the Union Texas Petroleum Corporation—the litigants—to everyone who said that they wished to appeal before the ruling was made by the judge an extraordinary two years after the initial court hearing, we would spark off a race for justice in the future. That is a hypothetical assertion of what may happen. We hope that such events will not recur; the case is comparatively unusual. If developments such as my hon. Friend foresees should arise, we shall have to take appropriate action, but we need not speculate now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) referred to the submission made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. I am not saying that it is rubbish, but it envisages the worst conceivable interpretation and speculates on what may happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is not prepared to go that far, does he think that there will be greatly increased litigation and more appeals if we pass this legislation?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such tax cases are relatively rare. Whether another will arise or will give rise to the sort of development that the hon. Gentleman suggests remains to be seen, but we need not speculate on what may be a problem.<br><br>
In their official amendment the Opposition suggested that we should go in the opposite direction and remove from Union Texas the protection that we have traditionally granted to those who have successfully gone to litigation, won a favourable ruling and proved that their own interpretation of the law was correct, even though we say that no one else should benefit from that re-interpretation of the law. It is only right and fair not to deprive those who have taken the trouble and incurred the expense to litigate and have thereby demonstrated their belief in a specific interpretation of the law, which it would be difficult to say did not antedate the litigation, of the benefits of successful litigation. I was pleased that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury tabled the amendment as a probing one and not as one in which the Opposition seriously believe. I do not know whether than means that they have had a change of heart or have been bought off by special interests. I leave it to them to carry out the sort of analysis that they make of my hon. Friends' motivation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Townend</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While not agreeing with the amendment, my right hon. Friend must agree that there is some logic in it. It is not equitable, if everyone thought the law stated one thing, but the courts found otherwise, to revert to the previous interpretation and then to make an exception of Union Texas. There is no equity in that proposition for Union Texas and others whose appeals are pending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is strange and anomalous, but it is undoubtedly the fairest treatment. It was established by precedent in the Padmore case and elsewhere that when a litigant succeeds in litigation and obtains a ruling in his favour, which Parliament chooses to reverse, he is allowed the benefit of the litigation in recognition of his commitment, time, trouble and expense. It is considered wrong to overrride the court on the specific instance on which the court ruled.<br><br>
The provision is strange and perhaps uneven, but it is better than any of the alternatives that I can think of.<br><br>
The Government's case rests on the belief that everyone recognised before the Union Texas litigation the accepted treatment of tax and had operated under that interpretation since 1975. To suggest that we are upturning those settled arrangements is wrong. I have read past debates on retrospection because I am interested in the subject. The former right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, Mr Powell, once engaged in a debate on retrospection with the Labour Government who proposed to act retrospectively in a way that disturbed established and accepted arrangements. The former Minister protested that he was an expert because he has been a consultant on such matters in his private practice before becoming a Minister. Mr. Powell intervened to ask whether the Minister had ever been paid for giving retrospective advice.<br><br>

We are not changing the basis on which people were advised to make their arrangements and to pay their taxes. We are merely restoring the circumstances to what people had expected and in accordance with which they had arranged their business.</span></p>
