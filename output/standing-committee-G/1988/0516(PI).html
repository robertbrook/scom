<p>Finance Bill</p>
<p>(Except clauses 1, 32, 33, 44, 51 and 138)</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin this afternoon's sitting, I have two short statements to make to the Committee. It has been drawn to my attention that there are some gaps in the <i>Official Report</i> of our first sitting. They occur in columns 4, 8 and 43. I have directed that the necessary corrigenda be printed with the report of today's sitting, which means that hon. Members and those outside will have them at the earliest possible time. I hope that that meets with the Committee's approval.<br><br>
The second point is rather more substantial. My fellow Chairman made a statement last Thursday about starred and manuscript amendments. He said that he would select them for debate only in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
The Government tabled that night some very substantial amendments to schedule 3. Amendments to those, and resulting from those, could in theory have been tabled on Friday but many hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), were not then in London, and obviously some time was required for consultation.<br><br>
In those circumstances I have, exceptionally, accepted for debate the starred amendments tabled on Monday. I want to make it clear that from now on I shall not regard such circumstances as exceptional. I cannot therefore undertake to accept starred amendments. I hope that in future both Government and Opposition can co-operate to ensure that adequate notice is given of amendments, so that there is no need for amendments to be tabled so late that they are starred. I also ask that the bush telegraph on a Friday operates rather more effectively than it did last Friday. The amendments involved in my statement are underlined on the selection list, and are amendment Nos. 159, (a) to (i) and 162. They are all to schedule 3.</span></p>

Clause 25</div> <!-- clause -->

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
RELIEF FROM CAR TAX WHERE VEHICLE LEASED TO THE HANDICAPPED</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 17, line 5, leave out from "where" to ('the" in line 11 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"on the date when, apart from subsection (2)(a) below, tax on a chargeable vehicle would become due from a person registered under this Act, there is held by him or on his behalf a certificate of a person to whom the vehicle is sold".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 50 to 53.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We accept your wise ruling on the previous matter, Mr. Cormack, and will naturally try to comply with your wishes and ensure that such circumstances do not recur.<br><br>
The amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary are in response to consultations since the original announcement was made about car tax relief for cars for the handicapped, to meet certain problems that had arisen with the trade. The clause as drafted provided that a car tax registered trader must hold a certificate
<br><blockquote><p>"at the time when he sends it out".</p></blockquote>
It being the vehicle. That provision is too restrictive because it is the practice for car manufacturers and importers to send out vehicles to dealers on a sale or return basis. The existing clause does not allow relief on vehicles supplied from such stock, because at the time of supply the vehicle has already been sent out.<br><br>
Adoption of the amendments would extend relief to vehicles supplied from the dealer's sale or return stock provided that he holds the certificate on the date on which the vehicle is supplied. It would fit in with trade practice and allow the handicapped person to take delivery of the vehicle more quickly.<br><br>
The clause will be widely welcomed by the Committee as it has been already by Motability and all those concerned with providing vehicles for the handicapped. The relief applies whether the handicapped person proposes to drive the leased car, or is driven in it by someone else. It applies to ordinary cars, not just those that must be specially converted for the handicapped. The relief reduces the financial burden on those who, through handicap, cannot use public transport. Motability estimates that as many as 30,000 cars a year may eventually benefit from the relief, because it will reduce costs, especially initial costs, enabling more handicapped people to lease cars than at present.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments, which simply improve the working of a widely welcomed relief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my hon. Friends, I welcome you, Mr. Cormack, as Chairman of our proceedings. I also welcome the sagacity of your decisions hitherto on both <i>Hansard</i> and the acceptance of starred amendments that were tabled in straitened circumstances.<br><br>
We entirely accept the amendments. They provide a useful tightening up of the existing uncertanties, and we welcome the extension of the provisions of the clause.<br><br>
We also give a warm welcome to the relief provided under clause 25. However, there is one small point that I should like to make. I understood the Economic Secretary to say that this car tax relief will be available to someone who is hiring a vehicle on behalf of and for the use of a disabled person, rather than going to the disabled person who is actually hiring the vehicle. Did I hear the Economic Secretary correctly? If so,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
that seems to fall foul of the Value Added Tax Act 1983, which is referred to in the clause. If I have misunderstood, it would be useful to have the matter clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) for allowing me to clarify that point.<br><br>
I was not saying that vehicles could be leased by someone other than the handicapped person. However, a handicapped person who cannot or does not wish to drive can lease a vehicle and be driven in it by someone else, such as another member of the family. That is accepted within the rules. The hiring itself is done by the disabled person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that clarification. In other circumstances, we might have wished to go a little further than the Government in that respect, but we welcome the steps that they have taken in clause 25 and in the amendments to it.</span></p>

PAYROLL DEDUCTION SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to clauses 55, 56 and 57, which deal with the tax arrangements for charities. Clause 55 seeks to double the limit that can be subscribed by an individual within the payroll giving scheme that the Government established a few years ago.<br><br>
The Opposition do not object to the decision to lift the limit on the total annual amount of £240 to £480 that can be subscribed through the pay-as-you-give scheme because it provides additional potential benefit for charities. However, the clause gives us scope to consider what has happened to the payroll giving scheme since it was instituted. The take-up under the scheme has been extremely disappointing; that may lie at the heart of the Government's decision to double the limit, as they doubled it last year when they realised that the take-up was disappointing.<br><br>
When the Chancellor of the Exchequer launched the payroll deduction scheme in 1986, he said that he expected it to raise between £70 million and £75 million a year for charity. The latest estimates that we can establish from a series of parliamentary questions tabled by my hon. Friends show that about £1 million
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
has been donated in the past year. Perhaps the figure has crept up towards £2 million in the past financial year, but that is a long way from the bold prediction of £70 million for charity that the Chancellor made in 1986. Indeed, the Chancellor has been so worried that in September last year there was considerable publicity about an attempt by him, together with Mr. Ronnie Corbett—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Little and Large.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—to encourage taxpayers to take up payroll deduction scheme giving. My hon. Friend mentions Little and Large. One is tempted to observe in the double act of Corbett and Lawson that one is as tall as the other is broad and, to ask who is the better comedian and who would make the better Chancellor. It is indicative that the Chancellor felt the need to summon assistance in trying to get the payroll giving scheme off the ground.<br><br>
The current take-up is difficult to ascertain. There has been a series of parliamentary answers. An answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ms Mowlam) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1987–88 it is estimated that about 60,000 employees participated in the scheme and £1 million was donated. The number of participants and the amount of donations are expected to be considerably higher in 1988–89. Current indications are that about 100,000 employees are participating, but it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast at this stage for the year as a whole."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 13 February 1989; Vol. 147, <i>c.86.</i>]</p></blockquote>
4.45 pm<br><br>
In reply to another question, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) on 24 February but answered on 3 March the Financial Secretary again stated that he estimated that
<br><blockquote><p>"about 100,000 employees are currently participating in the payroll-giving scheme."</p></blockquote>
So we already have two slight discrepancies—an indication that 100,000 employees are participating and an estimate that that number were participating. The Financial Secretary went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"This represents about 0.5 per cent. of all income taxpayers."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 3 March 1989; Vol. 148, <i>c.345.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The number goes up slightly in the latest answer that I can unearth, which is in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). The Financial Secretary states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is estimated that over 120,000 people were participating in the scheme at the end of 1988–89."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 May 1989; Vol. 152, <i>c.315.</i>]</p></blockquote>
We seem to be talking about between 100,000 and 120,000 employees taking up the opportunities available under the scheme. Figures seem to vary depending on the month.<br><br>
It is noticeable that when my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East asked for an estimate of the proportion of top rate, as opposed to basic rate, taxpayers taking up the scheme, the answer was that the information could not be given. It is somewhat odd that the Government, who are normally forthcoming about what proportion of those benefiting fall within the top rate bracket,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
cannot give any such information on this scheme. It would be useful if the Paymaster General could say when the Government expect to have that information.<br><br>
It is worth noting the estimates in the charity household survey that the Charities Aid Foundation published last year as it is the most up-to-date information available about individual giving habits. The foundation suggests that in each year from 1985–87 there was no real increase in the proportion of income that the average household gave to charity. On a year-by-year basis, as a proportion of income, it appears from the foundation's figures—the most authoritative voice on the matter—that the amount of household giving to charity did not increase, although the foundation admits that the figures are difficult to interpret. It must be a disappointment to a Government who have set such store by increasing personal giving as participation by the state declines that there has been no perceptible increase in the amount of household giving over that period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point. Is he participating in the give-as-you-earn scheme? Have other Opposition Members increased their charitable giving, following the tax advantages that they have enjoyed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer that interesting question, although it is hardly germane to our discussion. No, I am not participating in the payroll giving scheme although I give substantial amounts to numerous different charities each year. I am sure that all members of the Committee can answer in the same fashion.<br><br>
The amount given by individuals to charities in one year is a relatively small proportion of charities' total income. The total receipts in 1987 of all charities in the United Kingdom amounted to approximately £12 billion. Only one seventh of that total came from individual donations and fund-raising. The remainder was raised in fees and charges. We should remember that individual donations represent only a small part of the picture and that the payroll giving scheme represents only a small percentage of the donations. Reductions in the rate of income tax which inevitably affect the amount of covenant income, reduce charities' total income. The Government are not being even-handed. They assist the payroll giving scheme with one hand, but adversely affect charities' covenant income with the other.<br><br>
Last year when we discussed the top rate tax breaks given by the Government to the top 5 per cent. of earners, we were told that one of the plus factors would be that the rich would give more of their money to charity. That is not evident from the figures made available by the Charities Aid Foundation over the past four years nor from the survey carried out by it shortly after last year's Budget. When the beneficiaries of the massive tax benefits were surveyed, only 3 per cent. said that they would give charities any part of their refunds. That paints a sad picture. In the past few years households have not increased the proportion of their income given to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
charities. The payroll giving scheme that the Government have assiduously promoted by raising the limit each year and by bringing in Ronnie Corbett has not brought about a dramatic increase in donations to charities. Nor has the giving of top-rate tax cuts to the very rich resulted in those wealthy people giving more of their income to charity; they have kept it for themselves.<br><br>
That picture provides the background to the clause. The Government are frantically attempting to make the payroll giving scheme more attractive by increasing the overall limit, but the measures that they have taken in the past four to five years have given no real benefit to charities.<br><br>
The Government have set great store on the doctrine of the active citizen and the idea that we should all be wealth creators and use the gains for the benefit of our fellow citizens. That was the burden of the Prime Minister's speech almost exactly a year ago, in what has become known in Scotland as the Sermon on the Mound—her speech to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at its building on the Mound in Edinburgh. When I read the text of her speech I felt doubly aggrieved: I was concerned about the content and, as a member of the Church of Scotland, I was concerned at the choice of the Kirk in which to make that speech. The doctrine of the active citizen seemed to be at the heart of her remarks. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The spiritual dimension comes in deciding what one does with the wealth. How could we respond to the many calls for help, or invest for the future, or support the wonderful artists and craftsmen whose work also glorifies God, unless we had first worked hard and used our talents to create the necessary wealth?"</p></blockquote>
So far as it goes, one could not quarrel with that. The initial creation of wealth is important. But while the decisions of individual citizens are important, the collective decisions of the community and the Government about the disposal of the wealth are crucial.<br><br>
A line-by-line examination of the Prime Minister's speech to the Church of Scotland shows that the emphasis is solely on individual responsibility. In the speech, there is no recognition—indeed, there is a positive rejection—of any sort of social responsibility in society. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Christianity is about spiritual redemption, not social reform … they stem not from the social but from the spiritual… We must not profess the Christian faith and go to Church simply because we want social reforms."</p></blockquote>
5 pm<br><br>
Time and time again in the speech, the Prime Minister laid into the idea that society has a responsibility. Everything that the Government have done has shuffled off communal responsibility, which society has and which the Government should promote for the welfare of citizens, on to the individual alone. It is that philosophy—a philosophy that is over-dignified by the description of the active citizen—which lies at the heart of the Government's attempt to encourage individual giving to charity. The Opposition find that philosophy deeply flawed. Of course, we wish to see individuals encouraged in every way to give more to charity, but we also wish to see the Government accept the responsibility,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
which they bear on behalf of society, to ensure the welfare and benefit of all. It is on that point that the Government have so sadly failed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must agree that in that speech the Prime Minister dealt specifically with what individuals could do and how that fitted into Conservative philosophy. Does he not agree that an individual commitment to a charity is much more meaningful that the Government providing one on that person's behalf? The individual can choose which charity he wishes to support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the first point. The Prime Minister was not dealing specifically with the role of the individual. At the outset of her speech, she made it clear that she was talking about her overall Christian vision. She began:
<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps it would be best if I began by speaking personally as a Christian, as well as a politician, about the way I see things."</p></blockquote>
That is not just how she sees the individual, but how she sees things in general; the shape of society and the way in which it operates.<br><br>
On the second point, that it was more meaningful for an individual to give than for society to do so by means of Government action, I say to the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) that they are both meaningful acts. It is as meaningful if an individual decides wilfully not to subscribe to Oxfam, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution or the Cancer Research Campaign as it is for a Government to decide to withdraw housing benefit from the poorest people. They are equally meaningful acts and both deserve the attention of the House and the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been slightly worried about the hon. Gentleman's spiritual welfare since he began this part of his speech. He would derive more support for his view from the robust critique offered since the Prime Minister's speech by my constituent, Professor Whyte, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, of which I am glad to hear that the hon. Gentleman is a member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. Professor Whyte has been in the forefront of those who have provided an acute and perceptive critique of the type of doctrine that the Prime Minister advocated in her speech a year ago.<br><br>
I realise that I have gone rather wide of the specifics of the clause, but the relevant point is that, although the Government's philosophy and the Prime Minister's credo, in ascribing everything to individual action and nothing to society, is deeply flawed, the Government are failing even on their own terms. They are failing to increase individual participation in charitable giving through the payroll deduction scheme and annual household donations to charities in general.<br><br>
In what was obviously a period of religious attention, the Prime Minister made a speech to the Conservative women's conference. Stepping outside the realms of the Kirk and into the realms of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
chapel, she quoted, or perhaps misquoted, John Wesley when she said that in one of his sermons he maintained that the job of individuals was to
<br><blockquote><p>"gain all you can, save all you can, give all you can."</p></blockquote>
That sums up her economic philosophy. In only one of those respects have the Government been successful. They have ensured that a portion—only a portion—of the population gain all they can. They have been totally unsuccessful in ensuring that the population save all they can. Personal savings are at their lowest since records began. They have been totally unsuccessful in ensuring that people give all they can. The figures speak dramatically against them.<br><br>
It is because of the failure to ensure better giving by individuals that the Government have proposed clause 55, which increases the amount that an individual can give through the payroll deduction scheme in any one year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Diane Abbot <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is no surprise that the Government have failed to increase the amount of personal donations to charities. It is hypocrisy for them to say that by fiscal means they are facilitating donations by individuals to charities while Ministers go round saying that poverty has ceased to exist and that it is merely relative. That will scarcely encourage charitable giving. Far from echoing the sentiments of the original Sermon on the Mount—"Blessed are the poor"—the Government are now saying that the poor no longer exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Being an inner London representative in Parliament, she knows as well and as graphically as I do, how much real, acute poverty there is in large parts of our country. For the Secretary of State for Social Security, or anyone else, to go round saying that poverty no longer exists is, frankly, an obscenity. In such a climate and with such an attitude from the Government, it is hardly surprising that ordinary individual people do not take the fiscal lead that the Government claim to want to give them and increase their personal giving to charity.<br><br>
It is with some sadness and anger that we accept the clause and are prepared to see the overall limit for personal giving under the payroll deduction scheme go up as the Government wish. But it would be much better if the Government were sincere about charitable giving and accepted their social responsibility as well as their duty to encourage individual responsibility. They should give a real lead to people by raising the amount that individuals can give, so that charities can count on the donations of individual people and families throughout the country. Tawdry as the Government are in their approach, we do not oppose the clause as it may bring some marginal benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I came to the House from an industry that is used to payroll deduction schemes. Coal miners have long favoured that method of contributing to charities. It is worth remembering that such tax deduction schemes did

not exist until recently and that when a quarter of a million miners were contributing to payroll deduction schemes, as they were when I first entered the industry, a large amount of money was given. People believed in giving, and not because it was another way to lay off some funds and receive a tax concession as an earthly reward.<br><br>
It casts a curious light on this past decade that the provision is seen as encouraging generosity. I come from a society where that generosity exists anyway. People give as individuals because they believe that all individuals are responsible for the society in which they exist and for those who are unable, for whatever reason, to earn sufficient funds to keep body and soul together. The measure is an indictment on this society, which is supposed to be caring as well as efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall stick to the particulars of the scheme and try to oblige the Economic Secretary to explain why the scheme has failed so badly.<br><br>
When the scheme was introduced, there was a great deal of trumpeting about how successful it would be. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) referred to the hopes that £70 million or £80 million a year would be raised. The best estimates that have been put before us today are that 0.5 per cent. of the population—perhaps 100,000 people—are involved in the scheme and £1 million a year is given.<br><br>
Both sides of the Committee would agree that the scheme is an efficient way of giving. If people can get tax relief on the amounts that they give, that should be encouraged. Why, then, has the scheme failed? When it was set up, there was a good deal of discussion about whether it would be best to assist individual charities or whether a consortium of charities should agree with major employers or trades unions to allow employees to give collectively or individually. The money would then be allocated to the charities in the proportion agreed by the employers. That did not transpire. In Scotland it was even suggesed that agencies be set up to manage the scheme. The Glasgow Council for Voluntary Service offered to organise it so that giving could be more effective. Similarly, the Scottish Council of Social Service spoke of managing the scheme.<br><br>
There was concern that the major national charities would scoop the pool. As they are well known and have an up-front identity, it was feared that people would subscribe to them through payroll giving to the detriment of local charities, or that money would go only to the headquarters, not the branches.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
It is strange that we are debating the cost of Government publicity. We believe that there has been a great misapplication of public funds to publicise Government schemes, but in this case there would be no objection to the Government giving the scheme a boost. However, they are failing to do so.<br><br>
Where did the scheme go wrong? It appears attractive, so what led to its relative failure? The problem will not be solved by raising the limit. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
people are not giving £240 a year, there is no reason why they should give £480 to a scheme to which they are not attracted. It might make sense to raise the limits for PEPs to increase their attractiveness, but the Government will not solve the problem of the failure of the payroll giving scheme merely by increasing the limits. At the moment people are not giving a limited amount, so why should they give more?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. Peter Brooke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was kind enough to tell me in advance that he was thinking of speaking for five minutes and asking one or two questions. His definition of five minutes reminds me a conversation with Lord Hailsham in which someone commented on the length of a speech. Lord Hailsham said comfortingly, "You should have been here in old Thomas's day. He had a story about Mesopotamia and until he had been going for 40 minutes, you did not know whether you would get the short or long version."<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury painted a narrative picture of what has happened under payroll giving, which was reinforced by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington). My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer painted an optimistic picture of the contribution that payroll giving would be able to make to the charitable and voluntary sector. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury quoted a figure of £70 million. He did not quote the Chancellor's forecast as to when that figure would be reached, but I acknowledge that the take-up has been less than the Government forecast.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to the seminar that the Government held with large donors and charities. It occurred in July rather than Septemer but that is not a matter of moment. I remember Mr. Ronnie Corbett's contribution because he spoke at about 6 pm during the play-off in the Open golf tournament. He apologised to all golfers present for having to listen to him instead of watching television. He felt particularly sympathetic because he was an enthusiast. Indeed, his wife had told him only the previous week at a quarter to midnight that he thought only of golf. As Mr. Corbett said, that was a surprising remark to hear on the 14th tee at that hour of the night.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury recited the series of parliamentary questions which have been tabled by his hon. Friends, including the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). He referred to the regular growth in figures provided in response to parliamentary questions that were a month or a couple of months apart. It would be alarming if the figures had been going backwards; in fact, they have shown satisfactory progress and have clearly demonstrated, insignificant jumps of 20,000 subscribers between questions, that the scheme now has a momentum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear the Paymaster General describe just over 0.5 per cent. of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
the taxpaying population subscribing as very satisfactory progress. Surely that is disappointing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman re-reads tomorrow what I am saying now, he will see that I made no reference to the overall take-up. I said that from month to month, the number of people who subscribe is growing in a very satisfactory manner which suggests that a momentum is developing which will be maintained.<br><br>
As to the discrepancies in the answers—the fact that the figures advance from month to month—the reason why it is difficult for the Government to give precise figures is that there is no contact between the employee and the Inland Revenue. The contact of the employee, who is the subscriber, is with the agencies; therefore, we rely on periodic information on progress from the agencies.<br><br>
The total donations to date have been about £5 million. We expect that the cost of relief last year will be £1.5 million. We now have 120,000 participants, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, and there are 3.700 schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General confirm that it is still not possible for 100 per cent. of employees of the Civil Service to join a payroll giving scheme—or has that changed in the recent past? He will know that better than most.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, the 570,000 employees of the Civil Service, as civil servants, are all now able to subscribe. There may be a tiny margin beyond that 570,000 who are not; if that turns out to be the case, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to giving by households. The total amount of tax repaid to charities has increased from £130 million in 1978–79, some £45 million of which was in respect of deeds of convenant, to some £400 million in 1987–88, of which some £180 million was in respect of covenants. The total tax relief for charities is now estimated to be about half a billion pounds. Between 1978–79 and 1987–88, covenanted giving to charities increased in real terms by 140 per cent. and bequests by 150 per cent. Those substantial increases may be disappointing to the hon. Gentleman and I acknowledge that in proportionate terms they may not be as dramatic as they should in absolute terms—obviously, they are expressed in real terms—but they are a function of increased prosperity in the country and much of that increased prosperity is flowing into charitable giving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Paymaster General, from the analysis of the number of participants, suggest where the money goes? It strikes me that, as my hon. Friend said, some of the money will go to the larger charities that can afford good advertising budgets rather than to the smaller charities. So the larger charities will eat up the donations of the smaller ones.<br><br>
Some of the charities at the top of the league for charitable giving in Britain are the animal charities.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
That may surprise other members of the international community who seem to think that we give higher priority to animals than to people. Is there any way of analysing where the money goes? As tax relief is involved, the money should be properly accountable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to answer the question that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has just asked when responding to the questions of the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie. However, it is easier to follow the text if I answer a question when it has been asked.<br><br>
Our present information, which we derive from the agencies responsible for sending the money on to the charities, is that more than 2,500 charities have already benefited. In concluding my response to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, I was going to say that, for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), I should like to keep track of that figure so that we can see evidence of the size of the charities to which the money is going.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that we had been unable to answer the question of his hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) about the proportion of top rate taxpayers in payroll giving. Again, the information about take-up comes from the approved agencies. They are not required by the regulations to report to the Inland Revenue the rate of tax paid by donors. The regulations aim to keep the burden on agencies and employers to a minimum, while ensuring that the money goes to genuine charities. I imagine that in the fullness of time we shall have a better idea of the spectrum involved.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury went on to make references not wholly flattering to the wealthier members of our society. An extremely interesting leader in <i>The Economist</i> some months back was devoted to the question of whether there would be a renaissance of the tradition that existed before 1914 where the more wealthy members of society gave to institutions important to everyone, such as universities, hospitals and art galleries.<br><br>
With respect to the questionnaires that have been issued and the information that we have so far, I shall say only that, although I am confident that the climate is changing and the figures that I have quoted show the progress that is being made, on all the economic changes that the Government have effected since 1979, we could not have put a precise date on when they would take effect and have the consequences predicted. So far, although they have been subject to somewhat carping observations from the Opposition Benches, our forecasts have come to pass and we have delivered what we assumed would flow from them. I have every confidence that that will apply in this instance, particularly in the payroll giving scheme.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury ascribed to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister the invention of the active citizen. However, its provenance and parentage probably belongs to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. I had not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0040">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
appreciated that in the current exhibition in Paris devoted to the French Revolution of 1789, much reference is made to the citoyen actif and the citoyen passif. The citoyen passif was allowed only to vote; the citoyen actif was allowed to vote and to be a representative. I shall ask my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary whether he took that into account in terms of the resurrection of the active citizen today.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury went on to subject an important speech made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to considerable textual analysis. There were moments during his speech, Mr. Cormack, when I thought that your forbearance and indulgence were most generous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But not to be taken as a precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But I am conscious that you are the rector of St. Margaret's, Westminster, Mr. Cormack, and that you take a keen interest in theological matters.<br><br>
Mr great grandfather was put up by Queen Victoria's daughter to be canon of Westminster. He was rejected by Disraeli on the grounds that his politics were unsatisfactory though his theology was immaterial and by Gladstone on the grounds that his politics were eminently satisfactory but his theology was impossible. He went on to become a Unitarian. That gives me a guarded view to the analysis of such speeches in the context of the Bill. However, the Committee will be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the degree of attention paid by him to the text of the speech of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. That is a tribute to its importance.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
It is no surprise, given the theme of the speech, that there was a concentration on the individual and the responsibilities of the individual, but if the hon. Gentleman pays the same attention to all my right hon. Friend's speeches—his quotation from Wesley in another speech in my constituency shows that he takes a keen interest in the subject—he will find that my right hon. Friend has referred since then to the concept of the community which was first hallowed by my predecessor as Paymaster General, the great Edmund Burke, and to which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has also contributed.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman approved of the first part of the quotation that he gave from John Wesley in the context of the past 10 years, but was critical in the context of savings and giving. The hon. Gentleman said that savings were at their lowest level, but he was talking about net savings. Savings continue to be at a substantial level, but show up at a low level in net savings because of the amount of borrowing. Giving has been the theme of the debate. Conservative Members are confident about the momentum being generated.<br><br>
I agree that it is difficult to predict the progress that the payroll giving scheme will make, but we are encouraged by the regularity with which increases are being made. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie that the scheme has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
failed, although I acknowledge that the take-up has been slower than we would have wished. The seminar last July dealt with that question and the Payroll Giving Association was set up. The instrument has been given to charities, but it is up to them to decide how they can make use of it and to determine ways to increase giving.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to consortia of charities. Charities can form consortia if they wish. Some have done so to promote themselves. I have attended one that was for nervous diseases and illnesses. However, it would be unfair to other charities and to employees if the consortia could make an exclusive deal with the employer. The present scheme permits all charities to benefit and gives employees a free choice of charity. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is an approved agency and promotes the scheme in Scotland.<br><br>
I referred to the number of charities participating in the scheme and look forward to updating those figures. The scheme has developed a momentum. The agencies have reported that a large number of new subscribers in the current year subscribe the full amount of £240. Therefore, I hope that those subscribers and new ones in the coming year will take advantage of the larger limit that we have set.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee, but wish to take up one or two points made by the Paymaster General. I warn him that the use of French phrases in his speech, which I applaud and accept, would not find favour with his hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow) who spent some time on the Floor of the House yesterday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That certainly is not relevant. I remind the Committee of the time-honoured custom that in debate one can use Greek sometimes, Latin as often as one likes but French never.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That gives an entirely new dimension to the phase "citoyen actif", Mr. Cormack. The Paymaster General attempted to shuffle off his analysis of the personal savings ratio as a figure net of borrowing and inevitably as borrowing increases, savings decrease. That is correct but it does not lessen the alarm which we ought to feel at the figure getting that low. The fact that people are borrowing so much that the net level of savings is being squeezed almost to zero ought to give us considerable cause for concern. The Opposition have wondered why the Government have not shown greater distress about the way those figures have been moving.<br><br>
The kernel of the Paymaster General's argument related to his statement that the flow of funds into charitable giving as a result of what he claimed was increased prosperity has been increasing in the past few years. I fear that we must express considerable scepticism about that. The figures for convenanted payments may be increasing but the evidence which appears to exist, especially the evidence from the Charities Aid Foundation, seems to indicate that personal giving is not rising as a proportion of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
personal income. That is based on a study of household income and giving over a wide spread in the population. That must be worrying for a Government who set such store by individual giving and individual participation. Having said that, it would be uncharitable of me not to say that the Opposition welcome the clause. But we must express our caution and scepticism about the Government's performance in generating individual giving in the course of the last few years.</span></p>

COVENANTED SUBSCRIPTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 44, line 6, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) the conservation of landscape of scenic value of the public benefit, or"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 133, in page 44, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) to have access to land the conservation of which is the sole or main purpose of charity, or"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 56 sets into legislation the position which has existed for the National Trust for some considerable time. When a member covenants a subscription to a specific number of charities with specific purposes and when a member covenants his subscription and receives in return the benefit of free entry to property or land which is the property of that charity, he will be able to see the tax relief that is available under covenants become available to the charity in the normal way. The problem was that for a certain number of charities it appeared that the giving of a benefit of free admission as part of membership meant that the charity could not then be eligible for the relief that would normally be available under the covenant system. The clause seeks to remedy that defect.<br><br>
The matter was raised in the debates on last year's Finance Bill because some charities had expressed concern about it. The Opposition are happy to accept the measure because it is sensible that, when a benefit of membership is free admission to property, tax relief under the covenanted subscription should be available to the charity.<br><br>
The amendments are designed more to probe than anything else because the definition of charities falling within the purview of the clause seems to be extremely tight. As the clause stands, a charity must be in the business of having as its main or sole purpose the preservation of property or the conservation of wildlife. When I read the clause, I had in mind two charities which are very dear to my heart. One is the National Trust for Scotland and the other is the John Muir Trust which was recently established in Scotland to preserve tracts of important landscape. The National Trust for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
Scotland has a far higher proportion of its holdings in land than the National Trust in England and Wales. In England and Wales, the National Trust tends to concentrate on the holding of property—houses and the gardens attached to them—although it owns substantial tracts in the Lake District.<br><br>
The National Trust for Scotland has in its portfolio many large areas of landscape in the most beautiful parts of Scotland. My concern was that the preservation of property for the public benefit might not entirely describe the bulk of the activity of the National Trust for Scotland. The John Muir Trust, which has recently purchased an area around the mountain of Ladhar Bheinn on the shores of Loch Hourn in the north-west of Scotland, is in a similar position to the National Trust for Scotland. It purchases land for its landscape and not its wildlife value. It buys land rather than bricks and mortar, and that type of charity should fall within the provisions of the clause.<br><br>
It is a small, but important point. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to put our minds at rest. If we simply consider country houses and wildlife sanctuaries, we shall miss out on the inclusion of other equally important charities within the provisions of the clause.<br><br>
I hope that the Paymaster General will give us some guidance as to the meaning of the phrase "sole or main purpose". He will doubtless have received notes on the clause from the legislation monitoring service for charities, which express its concern at the tightness of the definition. Although there are difficulties with the wording that the legislation monitoring service proposes, we share its anxieties at the tightness of the clause. We hope that the Government will tell us whether a charity engaged in educational activities, as well as the preservation and conservation referred to in the clause, would be prohibited from receiving the benefit that is available. So there are two important points, one of which is enshrined in our amendments and the other is related tangentially to it. I hope that the Government can give us some guidance.</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said, the matter was raised in the Finance Bill last year in response to the specific concerns of the National Trust, the National Trust for Scotland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which were all under the illusion that they could get tax relief on covenanted subscriptions from members and, in return, give them free, or cheaper, access to properties that they own. That was a long-standing practice that the Inland Revenue was challenging at that time. It would have affected severely the ability of those three charities to continue their activities on the same scale.<br><br>
I am pleased that the clause is included in this year's Finance Bill and that the necessary changes have been made. I am also pleased that the clause is tightly drawn, because some properties owned by those charities may not be covered by the definition. The public have free access to coastal properties, such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
as those for which the National Trust is renowned for preserving. None of the three charities charges the public for access to land that it owns but does not require vast expenditure to maintain, although the National Trust charges for access to country houses and other places that need a great deal of money spent on conservation. The tight wording of the clause meets the objections that the National Trust, the National Trust for Scotland and the RSPB had to the way that the Inland Revenue was starting to implement the restriction on covenanted giving.<br><br>
However, the clause raises the question of whether this is the right way to give the public money to heritage charities. There are many competing demands on heritage money that the Government may wish to give. Allowing money to be given as a result of covenanted subscriptions generally may not be the most effective way of directing it. Competing calls on heritage money should be evaluated carefully so that the money that the Government give to preserve our heritage will have the greatest effect. That will not be done by tax deduction or covenanted subscriptions in a broader way than has been allowed in the clause.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that the clause is tightly drawn and that it has been incorporated in the Bill, because it establishes the position that the three charities thought existed before the Inland Revenue implemented changes on its practice of covenanted subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury gave a trailer in our short debate last year to his interest in the National Trust for Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, who has also participated in the debate today, also brought the matter to the Committee's attention a year ago.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said in response to the debate on covenants in the Finance Bill a year ago that it was recognised that there was a problem with the National Trust but that he could not respond then, not least because consultation was necessary. He said that he would return later with a suggestion. That is the origin of clause 56.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury tabled two specific amendments and asked various questions arising from them. For certain heritage and conservation charities that operate membership schemes and provide for membership subscriptions to be paid by deed of covenant, clause 56 provides the right of free or cheap entry for members and their families to view property or observe wildlife. Those benefits will be ignored when determining the charity's entitlement to tax relief on the covenanted subscriptions.<br><br>
The charities involved must have as their "sole or main purpose" the preservation of property or the conservation of wildlife for the public benefit. That would include any charity that has as its "sole or main purpose" the conservation of landscape of scenic value for the public benefit. Diffidently, I suggest that amendment No. 132 is unnecessary. If Opposition Members want to elucidate later on specific doubts or any particular problems, we shall be happy to consider them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham commended the clause for being tightly drawn. His remarks possibly extend to clause stand part, but with your permission, Mr. Cormack, I shall respond to them. There could be a problem with amendment No. 133 if the intention is to allow access to charity property for purposes other than simply viewing property, as the clause proposes. For example, it could allow the members of a charity and their families free or cheap entry to charity property to take part in sports activities, such as hunting, fishing or shooting, to see or hear performances, or even to be educated. If that is the intention, it goes much wider than the clause, and I recommend that Committee members should resist it. The clause tackles the particular problem of admission of members to view heritage property and wildlife and there is no good reason to extend tax relief to other benefits that charities provide for their members.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury raised a specific question, with which members of the Committee had been circulated. Again, that question was more applicable to a clause stand part debate, but it may be convenient if I respond to it. The clause is aimed at charities that primarily deal with the preservation of the national heritage or the conservation of wildlife. That is the problem area that was identified in last year's debates. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the "sole or main purpose" of the charity to identify the charities involved.<br><br>
Those words are not unduly restrictive in practice. In dealing with individual cases, the Revenue will examine the substance and reality of the charity's aims and activities as a whole. For example, a museum's purposes may include the advancement of education, but the preservation and exhibition of its collection is clearly an important part of its aims and will be linked closely with its other activities. Museums that are charities should generally come under the clause.<br><br>
I shall repeat the offer that I made a moment ago. If individual charities are in doubt about their position, they may need to consult the Inland Revenue charity division. If members of the Committee have received representations from individual charities that the "sole or main purpose" test unfairly excludes them, I shall be glad to consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Paymaster-General for his helpful reply. The point of principal anxiety to Opposition Members was the conservation of landscape of scenic value. I am glad that the Paymaster-General believes that that will not cause any particular problem and we shall take up his offer if the need arises, although we hope that it will not. In the light of his generous offer, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 44, line 27, leave out "14th" and insert "15th".<br><br>
This is a probing amendment to ascertain why the particular date in the clause was chosen.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can answer the question simply. The date applies to covenant payments due on or after Budget day.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only thing that was in our minds was whether the clause should apply from the day after Budget day rather than from the day itself.

BRITISH MUSEUM AND NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to ask the Paymaster General a simple question. Why does the clause mention only the British museum and the Natural History museum? I was tempted to table an amendment to add the Victoria and Albert museum to the list in the clause, but I should have been even more tempted if I had known that we should be sitting under your august Chairmanship, Mr. Cormack, in the light of your valuable and respected role as chairman of the all-party parliamentary heritage group. I resisted the temptation because I am sure that there is a simple explanation of why only those two museums are included in the provisions of the clause. I look forward to hearing that explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a paean to your Chairmanship, Mr. Cormack, that we should debate a heritage item having listened to a prolonged series of theological observations from the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. I readily confess to him and the Committee that I asked the same question when I read the clause. It is to the credit of the Inland Revenue that, during the preparation of the clause, it spotted an omission in the case of the British museum and the National History museum and was anxious to rectify the anomaly.<br><br>
The clause tidies up the provisions in existing legislation that give a special income tax exemption to the British museum and the Natural History museum. At present, the two museums are strictly exempt from tax only on income from land and dividend income, not on other types of income such as covenants. The clause gives them exemption on the same types of income as charities generally.<br><br>
Historically, the two museums have enjoyed a tax privilege since at least the early 19th century, which entitles them to the limited income tax exemption that I described. That special provision has persisted to the present day but, although charities have, over the years, been able to claim tax relief on a broader range of income sources, the tax relief available to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
the museums has been limited, basically, to these long-standing special provisions. It is not entirely clear why the situation has developed in this way—in that sense I cannot satisfy fully the hon. Gentleman's curiosity—but there is no reason why the British museum and the Natural History museum should be denied the income tax exemption that is available to charities.<br><br>
The question whether in law the two museums are charities is not entirely free from doubt. This provision will bring them into line with many other museums that are charities—here I make a parenthetical reference to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the Victoria and Albert museum—and in particular will allow them to claim exemption from tax in respect of income from deeds of covenant, which is at present denied them. Thus they will be able, if they so wish, to take advantage of the new provisions of clause 56, if enacted.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following carefully what the Paymaster General says. If the Inland Revenue has indeed spotted that anomaly, it deserves full credit for having done so.<br><br>
There are other national institutions that might not immediately be thought of as charitable bodies, such as the National Gallery or the National Gallery of Scotland. Is the Paymaster General confident that they are equally covered by the existing provisions that he says apply to other museums?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My general experience of life is that one can be certain of nothing. For two and a half years I was the Minister responsible for the Natural History museum, and throughout that time, I was in total ignorance of the deprivation suffered by the museum because there had been no change under previous finance legislation.<br><br>
From other prior experience, I know the difficulty of coping with legislation that was formed in the early 19th century. I served for two years as a Lords Commissioner to the Treasury on the Crown Estate Paving Commission, which is responsible for Regents park and the Crown estate in this part of London. We had to administer the parking regulations in Regents park on the basis of a statute passed in the reign of King George IV.<br><br>
To the best of my knowledge—although, as I said, I am not certain of anything—no other institution has been identified that might have come within the purview of the hon. Gentleman's question. I have absolute confidence that, if the Inland Revenue spots another anomaly, it will seek to put it right.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to provoke a debate on the clause, as all the meat is in the schedule. However, it may be helpful if I spell out briefly the general approach and background to the clause and schedule, as there may not otherwise be the opportunity to do so.<br><br>
The clause and schedule are the result of the sixth directive that was agreed in 1977 and allowed the United Kingdom to retain zero rates only for clearly defined social policies and for the benefit of the final consumers. The Commission—unnecessarily, in my view—took us to the European Court in respect of a number of zero rates which, it held, infringed those criteria. We fought vigorously on all fronts in the European Court and won a victory on housing, which was the most important issue. But unfortunately we were bound to implement the European Court's unwelcome decision that our zero rates on non-domestic construction were unlawful.<br><br>
At the same time as implementing that decision, which makes up the bulk of these provisions, we are taking the opportunity to legislate on some other items that do not flow directly from the European Court's judgment, but that can conveniently be changed to remove anomalies. I showed clearly which they were when publishing draft clauses in February.<br><br>
Our philosophy in implementing the European Court's decision is to interpret as generously as the ruling permits and to use the flexibility—such as it is—in VAT law so that the burden, particularly on the construction industry, is minimised. We have used the option to tax—officially known as the election to waive exemption—and have introduced transitional reliefs. We have also protected residential property by interpreting "residential" as widely as possible within the ruling, and have done our best to protect charities. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor introduced several measures in the Budget, some of which we have discussed today, to compensate charities for the unavoidable costs that this ruling imposes on them, even after the prospective measures that we have introduced.<br><br>
As a result of those measures, we have minimised the revenue that the Exchequer will receive from this significant extension of taxation. In the current year we expect revenues of some £35 million from private sector construction and property, rising to £110 million, as against £450 million, which we might have secured had we not introduced limitations on the burden of the tax.<br><br>
It is impossible to prevent the tax from biting altogether, and it falls particularly on the exempt sector, which includes banks, many financial institutions, private hospitals, fee-paying schools, betting shops and charities. Naturally, the reaction of those who must pay the tax is regretful. They do not like it, and we regret it, too. But, by and large, the industries concerned welcome the way in which we have tried to minimise the burden on them, although they may have reservations about individual aspects of the Bill, which will be reflected in some of the amendments. The Bill received an especially warm welcome from charities, which have acknowledged that we have gone as far as possible, within the Court ruling, to minimise the impact on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
them. There has also been a constructive response from the Opposition on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Curry <span class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that this is one of the biggest upheavals in VAT legislation since the tax was introduced in 1973. He will also be aware that the building and development trade will find the change difficult to get used to. What attitude will Customs and Excise take when errors are caused, in all innocence, because of the difficulties of coming to terms with the legislation, particularly in view of the new serious misdeclaration penalties and the interest charges that will come into force in December to tighten up the disciplinary framework? I should mention that I am an adviser to the Building Employers Confederation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point: this is the most far-reaching extension of VAT affecting the construction industry, although the revenue that we shall raise will be less than in the extension that was introduced in 1984 covering building improvements. However, although Customs and Excise must reserve the right to collect tax that is properly due, including default interest, it has the discretion to accept any reasonable excuse before imposing misdeclaration penalties. A lenient view of genuine misunderstanding of the new liability regime for construction and property will be taken for the first year to 18 months, and special consideration will be given to the levying of penalties on areas resulting from unfamiliarity with, or misunderstanding of, the new regime. I hope that that will reassure those who find this legislation a trifle perplexing. Essentially, we are applying a simple procedure to a very complex industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. John Marek <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few statements before we embark on schedule 3. For once, I shall make my comments briefer than those of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). On the other hand, we have many amendments to discuss and we must treat them more expeditiously if we are to get through them.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his comments about the support that the Opposition have given the Government in their efforts to change the VAT system for commercial buildings and in certain other areas. However, we do not believe that the Government have got it quite right. Certain parts of the schedule will lead to unfairness. Other parts are simply wrong because of drafting errors. It came as no surprise that the Government tabled a fairly large amendment on Friday morning, when many hon. Members had already gone to their constituencies. The problem is that most Labour Members are banished a long way from London. Conservative Members have the advantage of being clustered around the South-East. Many of us are simply not able to get back in time to look at these amendments. I am grateful to you, Mr. Cormack, for agreeing to select our starred amendments.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary said that the sixth VAT directive was signed in 1977, the implication being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
that the previous Labour Government are the cause of all these evils. I looked up the relevant <i>Hansard</i> of Standing Committee D which considered the Finance Bill that year. I hope that what I read out will at least make it honours even. If fault is to be apportioned, it ought to be apportioned equally. The right hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. Howell) was leading for the Opposition at that time. [<i>Interruption.</i>] One of my hon. Friends says that he still is and I understand exactly what he means. Speaking about the sixth VAT directive, the right hon. Member said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would also make clear that the Opposition at any rate are not hostile to the aims and objectives behind the schedule."</p></blockquote>
The Conservative party gave clear support to the sixth VAT directive. He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not know whether that goes for Ministers on the Treasury Bench".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 26 May 1977; <i>c. 366.</i>]</p></blockquote>
If anyone was more suspicious of this sixth VAT directive it is likely that it was the Labour party rather than the Conservative party. The sixth VAT directive had to be signed because we entered the Common Market. That was not something initiated by the Labour party, I hasten to add, but it will not cause us problems. It will cause the Conservatives problems as we enter the run up to the next general election. I hope that Conservative Members will not now blame us for signing the sixth VAT directive.<br><br>
I hope that we will look at these proposals fairly. They deal to a large extent with builders, developers and landowners. They must be treated fairly because the food in our supermarket will be more expensive and houses will be dearer if more tax has to be paid in the process of developing shopping centres or building houses. I have tried to be brief but I hope that the Economic Secretary will give full answers to many of the points made. In some cases, they are quite difficult and I would be the first to admit that I do not comprehend the whole meaning of schedule 3. I know that hon. Members have had much correspondence about village halls, community centres and the necessity to raise VAT on their business activities as opposed to their non-business activities. This should not be a party political debate, but we should explore ways to avoid the imposition of this tax on such institutions.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have received representations about caravans and the proposal to put VAT on site pitch fees. I understand the reasoning for it as a result of the infraction proceedings and the judgment of the European Court, but the Committee should explore carefully whether we could absolve holiday caravan owners from having to pay VAT on a certain part of their expenses.<br><br>
I hope that the Economic Secretary is not short of brief because I am sure that what he says will be read by many people throughout the country.</span></p>

VALUE ADDED TAX: BUILDINGS AND LAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 150, line 10 after "solely" insert "or mainly".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 94, in page 152, line 22, leave out "solely" and insert "mainly".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In all honesty I do not expect the Government to accept these amendments. Paragraph 1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The grant by a person constructing a bulding … intended for use solely for a relevant residential purpose or a relevant charitable purpose".</p></blockquote>
If a group 8 building construction fell into that subparagraph, it would be zero-rated under schedule 5 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983.<br><br>
A "relevant charitable purpose" is defined in line 1 of page 151, whereas a "relevant residential purpose" is not defined, or if it is I have missed it. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will give me an explanation. The problem is that the word "solely" is too restrictive. The amendment may ride a coach and horses through the tight wording of the group, but some effort should be made to define precisely a "relevant residential purpose" and a "relevant charitable purpose".<br><br>
The definition of a "relevant charitable purpose" should be loosened a little in the light of my remarks on clause 17. A charitable organisation may carry out a small amount of business. Nearly all its work may be for a charitable purpose and only a tiny amount—perhaps less than 5 per cent.—may be what the Customs and Excise regard as business activities, such as the letting of a hall once a month or every two months. If a charity's business activities are few, a minimum provision could be applied by the Customs and Excise. That is the intention of amendments Nos. 89 and 94.<br><br>
Ninety per cent. of a building, such as a block of flats, must be for residential purposes. A certain tolerance may be acceptable to the Customs and Excise. I would be happy to hear the views of the Economic Secretary on that matter. That would affect housing associations or associations providing domestic dwellings which include a small office for administration. Would such a dwelling come within the scope of item 1 of group 8?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can allay the fears that have led the Opposition to table the amendment. They are right that the amendment would drive a coach and horses through the relevant part of the schedule. To widen the relief to include buildings or parts of buildings intended to benefit other than the final consumers would be unacceptable under European VAT law and might provoke a further infraction case. For buildings of mixed use, note (5) already requires an apportionment where only and identifiable part of the building is intended for a qualifying use—residential use or non-business charitable use. However, Customs accept that there will be some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
rough edges and have announced that they will ignore a simple office incorporated in a communal residential building.<br><br>
In the 1 April 1989 edition of the VAT leaflet "Construction industry", paragraph 2(c) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mixed works. Where only part of a building qualifies for zero-rating, you must make a reasonable apportionment between the zero-rated and standard-rated work (however, you can ignore a simple office for the use of a warden, matron or similar person in a residential home etc.)"</p></blockquote>
With non-business charity buildings the note (5) apportionment provision has equal effect for identifiable parts of a building which are not to be used for a qualifying purpose. In many cases, however, unlike communal residential buildings where the use is fairly easy to identify, charities use buildings indiscriminately, sometimes for their non-business activities and sometimes not. The Government decided that it would not, therefore, be possible to require apportionment on the basis of such use. The proportion would vary from time to time and it would be impossible to judge in advance, when the building contract was let, what the use would be and so forth. Customs accept that some de minimis provision is necessary and they have announced that they will ignore indiscriminate business use for non-business charity buildings where it is not expected to exceed 10 per cent. of the time the building is normally available for use. So that meets the hon. Gentleman's main point.<br><br>
"Mainly" in the amendment could mean that as much as 49 per cent. of a building could be used for purposes other than that for which zero-rating is intended. There is no justification for allowing persons who could well be in business, whether taxable or exempt, from obtaining zero-rated premises costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds to which they are not entitled. The VAT amounts on buildings are far larger than those involved for fuel and power. While for fuel and power the position can be regularly re-assessed with every quarterly account if necessary, that sort of reappraisal is quite impossible for buildings to be used indiscriminately for both business and non-business purposes. The VAT liability has been decided at the instruction stage.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked for a definition of a "relevant residential purpose". It is defined in note (3) to group 8 at page 150, line 32.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be absolutely clear on one point and make a comment on another. Sheltered accommodation may include a room for the warden and a room for the common use of the residents. Will that be taken into account when assessing the VAT rating of the building as a whole?<br><br>
I am concerned that the problem of building in inner city areas has not been taken on board by the Government in their housing legislation or in the VAT rating of buildings. It is more practical and easier to build on a green-field site and get the footings right and so forth than to build in inner city areas. For example, in west Leeds where I live, back-to-back terraced houses with cellars have been demolished. The infilling of cellars to get building going is an extra cost. Therefore, it is cheaper to build
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
on a green-field site than to fill in the cellars and build on top.<br><br>
Other inner-city sites may have been spoiled by having previously had gas works on them. If such sites have to be properly cleared before building can begin in inner city areas, there is an additional cost. Account must be taken of that additional cost in the financial arrangements for housing associations. We should focus on housing associations because sadly, they—rather than local authorities—are seen as one of the engines of housing development in the inner cities. If their financial arrangements do not allow them to make the extra payments to cover the additional costs of building on inner-city sites, that building will not take place. If there is then the additional burden of value added tax, those sites will not be developed no matter what the Government say about their themes for inner-city improvement and so on.<br><br>
Inner-city housing will not be built because the abnormal costs, as they are called in the building trade, cannot be met. Therefore, the pressure will still be on the green belt. Were the Treasury officials unable to reconcile the intention behind the general provision for VAT on buildings with housing legislation? Government policy is surely to have improvements in housing development on difficult sites in inner cities, not least by housing associations. Many housing associations are classed as charities, and if we are not careful they will be priced out of inner cities and will be unable to do the job that most of them have been set up to do—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for the temperature. We have had to turn the fans off because they are interfering with the <i>Hansard</i> recording of the immortal words. It gives me the opportunity to say that I am extremely sympathetic to the remarks made last week, and because of that I have taken informal soundings and I propose that this Committee will move to the Grand Committee Room next week and, if possible, from Thursday of this week. There will then be plenty of room and no excessive heat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A popular move, Mr. Cormack.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) that where residential accommodation includes a community room, if it is an essential part of that accommodation it would be zero-rated along with the rest of it. We are not in a position to decide whether or not certain types of property shall retain zero rates because they are more costly to develop. If it is domestic construction, it will remain zero-rated; if it is non-domestic, and does not fit any of the charitable or other residential uses for which we have retained zero rates, it will be standard-rated and that will be an inevitable consequence of the judgment. Residential accommodation will remain zero-rated despite this judgment, and the amendment does not directly bear upon that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was extremely please by what the Economic Secretary said to me; his reply put my fears at rest. However, I am a little worried about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
what he has just said in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). He referred to homes where a community room is an essential part of that home. I wonder whether he meant to use the word "essential", because such a word could be argued about in Europe or in the courts for a long time. Many residential homes have a community room, but it is not necessarily essential. It could be argued that it is not essential but extra. I do not expect a reply at this stage; however, note (3)(a) to paragraph 1 of schedule 3 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a home or other institution providing residential accommodation for children".</p></blockquote>
I hope that Customs and Excise will interpret those words to mean that a home with two or three rooms for community use—of course, there is a limit—will receive the benefit of the doubt and that any construction on it will not bear VAT. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 150, line 19, after "services" insert "including any demolition necessary". This simple amendment bears upon what my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said about the filling in of cellars in inner-city areas even though it does not directly deal with that. I shall draw the Committee's attention to the VAT leaflet 708/2/89 on the construction industry. The Economic Secretary has already referred to it and paragraph 17 on page 8 deals with demolition. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the domolition of a building or civil engineering works is zero-rated as being in course of the construction of a dwelling or other qualifying building or work. This includes demolition down to:
<ul>
<li>ground level but leaving foundations</li>
<li>a single facade wall</li>
</ul>
The partial removal of a building or civil engineering work is standard-rated whether or not the part removed is to be replaced."</p></blockquote>
There are problems with that interpretation. I wonder what a "single facade wall" means. Does it mean a straight wall or does it mean a wall which curves, or could it be walls on two sides separated by a gap at the corner? At least the problem is clear, but it is not as good having a definition in a VAT notice as having one in legislation.<br><br>
Sometimes buildings are in conservation areas and the planning permission is such that a building cannot be demolished in order that another is put in its place. Will good conservation schemes fall foul of either the proposed legislation or the VAT leaflet on the construction industry? I am interested to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just to clarify a point arising from the previous clause. "Essential" in the context we are considering will mean "normal". Residential accommodation includes living rooms, too.<br><br>
The amendment is unnecessary. Customs and Excise have always accepted that complete demolition, done as part of site preparation, is entitled to zero-rating as being services supplied in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
the course of construction. Indeed, that has been incorporated in the VAT leaflet on the construction industry to which the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred. Paragraph 11 headed "Supplies in the course of new zero-rated construction" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"These are examples of zero-rated supplies:
<br><blockquote><p>demolition work carried out as part of a contract for the construction of dwellings or other qualifying buildings."</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
If demolition services were specifically referred to in the law, the European Commission might challenge the legality of such a provision because demolition services would not normally be supplied to the final consumer. We might therefore provoke a further infraction case. That might jeopardise the continued zero rating for those buildings, other than dwellings, which we have felt able to retain. Furthermore, the amendment as drafted raises the possibility of zero rating being extended to "partial" demolition, in that a part of an existing building could be removed to open up a site on which to construct a new zero-rated building. Such work has been standard-rated since June 1984, except as part of some alterations to protected buildings. To reintroduce such zero-ratings would be contrary to the Sixth VAT directive. That is why we cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that you will rule me out of order, Mr. Cormack, if I rehearse the debate that we had in this very Room on the Local Government and Housing Bill, which has just completed its Committee stage. But <i>Hansard</i> records agreement in that Committee that although the latest English house conditions survey showed that improvements had been made in housing conditions through demolition and new building and, to some extent, upgrading basic amenities such as inside toilets, the main project of urban renewal and renovation and improvement work had not taken place as most of us should have liked.<br><br>
Although I accept that the schedule contains European regulations, I am tempted to suggest that there should be at least some common standards for housing provision throughout the European Community. Perhaps we should lead the way by suggesting that demolition is not the only option, and that upgrading and renovating housing is a crucial way to improve inner city housing, as we have recognised in this country for the past 20 years.<br><br>
If schedule 3 is to remain as it is, and if we must accept it because of the Sixth VAT directive, our housing policy will lag behind because of an EEC directive. We are constrained by conditions that say that demolition is the way forward. I understand that demolition is zero-rated for VAT, whereas renewal and improvement attracts VAT, so it is clearly more attactive for builders to flatten and then construct new buildings than to improve.<br><br>
A contradiction in the schedule is created by the Government's policy on defective housing, which we support. I was tempted to mention it when I first heard the remark about levelling buildings to the floor. Legislation was passed some years ago dealing specifically with the problem of the backlog of system-built houses. Private builders tried to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
renovate that housing by improving and renewing the structure. In some cases, there was no satisfactory way to improve the structure; demolition and new building was the only option. However, in other cases, the building was improved; some deck access flats had their top levels removed so that traditional roof structures could be built.<br><br>
If the Schedule is to penalise such work, it will no longer take place. We may then have to campaign harder in terms of housing policy because simply to implement a VAT regulation for building will not achieve the objectives of improving Britain's housing stock.<br><br>
The discussions on the Local Government and Housing Bill and the English house conditions survey show that we still have a long way to go to deal with the backlog of substandard housing and to tackle the backlog of defective housing, which was the result of structures that were built as homes with experimental methods of 40 or 50 years ago, but not properly tried and tested. We cannot let the Government pass a VAT regulation that would penalise that work—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is becoming a little noisy. If private conversations must take place, they should be sotto voce or outside the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem still remains, although I accept the Minister's explanation. It is a great pity that we cannot simply broaden the zero rating to items requiring demolition where some of the structure is kept standing. It would be far better if that applied to some of our older houses, which may not be listed but have more than one facade worth keeping. I hope that the Treasury will not forget about the problem between now and next year's Finance Bill. If some way could be found of getting round the problem it would be in the interests of conservation of our heritage.<br><br>
However, in view of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several amendments have been tabled by Opposition Members and by Conservative Members and I hope that they will have the opportunity to speak to them. It is difficult to know what can be done because the Customs and Excise consider that when charities hire out a hall, they are engaging in business activities. If hiring out a hall is done on anything but a de minimus basis, the construction of a new hall or fuel supplies for it will attract value added tax. The original decision in the European Court did not mean that village halls and community centres should be liable to VAT in this way. Although our masters on many of these matters are in Brussels, I should have thought that if we were able to find a form of words to allow charities and village hall committees to escape value added tax, most members of the Committee would agree on the issue.<br><br>
Amendment No. 91 seeks to delete line 2 on page 151,
<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than in the course of furtherance of a business"</p></blockquote>
and insert,
<br><blockquote><p>"in the furtherance of its charitable aims."</p></blockquote>
That may be too much for the Economic Secretary to swallow, but many village halls are not hired out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
to make a profit, but to cover the running costs of the building and maintain it as a facility for the community. I do not believe that people in Europe, in the Government or in the Opposition wish such activities to attract value added tax. The spirit of the sixth VAT directive is such that those activities should not be subject to tax. Amendment No. 91 is a stab at making progress.<br><br>
Amendment No. 92 stands in the name of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell). I read amendment No. 10 with some amusement. Paragraph (ii) uses the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"providing that exemption of the services concerned shall not be likely to create distortions of competion such as to place at a disadvantage commercial enterprises liable to value-added tax'.".</p></blockquote>
Such is the hon. Gentleman's adherence to Rightwing prime ministerial economics, that in such an amendment he cannot avoid showing his colours. However, the spirit of his amendments is such that the Opposition can accept them. If it turns out that his amendment is not defective while ours are, we would support him if he pressed it to a Division. We shall be interested to see what the hon. Member for Corby decides to do.<br><br>
6.45 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 104 is also included in the group. It is slightly different from the others. It refers to paragraph 2(2)(b) on page 157, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"a building or part of a building intended for use solely for a relevant charitable purpose, other than as an office."</p></blockquote>
Our amendment deletes the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"other than as an office".</p></blockquote>
There is clear inequity here. The paragraph is about the election to waive an exemption. Charities that construct for non-business use will get full zero rating, but if they lease for non-business use, they will not get relief from VAT. There is a clear difference. All hon. Members will have received a letter from the Charities, VAT and Tax Reform Group and I shall leave it to my hon. Friends to make the point more forcefully than I have done in my few remarks.<br><br>
Amendment No. 81 relates to clause 20 and is another stab at getting VAT lifted from charities and village halls. Clause 20 relates to group 7 of schedule 5 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983. It contains a definition of qualifying use. Our amendment adds to that definition:
<br><blockquote><p>"use in a village hall or community centre where any profits made as a result of any business activities undertaken by the management or owners of the hall or centre are used for the maintenance of the building".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is straightforward. I wonder whether, if a general amendment is not acceptable to the Government or to Customs and Excise, a specific amendment would be acceptable. The Economic Secretary must not say that Europe will not wear this because I think that Europe would wear something like it. I do not believe that Europe intended village halls to attract VAT.<br><br>
Amendment No. 83 also refers to clause 20. It adds at the end of line 17 on page 13 the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the whole proceeds of that business are applied to the charitable purposes of that particular charity."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
It is a variation on amendment No. 91, but it is a form of wording that the Economic Secretary may be prepared to accept.<br><br>
I do not want to say any more at this stage. There is a problem. The country wants us to do something about this matter. I look forward to Government support and to the help of Conservative Members to ensure that the Committee does something for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Powell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) says, most people perceive a real problem with village halls. I am most concerned about that. I enter into my remarks, which I shall try to keep as brief as possible, although there are a number of matters that I must raise, in the spirit of goodwill enunciated by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and the hon. Member for Wrexham. I shall not blame anyone for the fact that we have to tackle what is perceived as the most awful mess by those who might be on the receiving end of substantial VAT bills, which they cannot reasonably be expected to pay. I accept that the Government are legislating only as a result of a judgment of the European Court. They resisted the course being forced upon them by the Commission, which the European Court ultimately found to be the correct interpretation of the VAT directive.<br><br>
I also accept that in this case, as in all cases where they have been found wanting in the European Court, the Government are doing the minimum necessary to comply with the judgment. That has been the Government's consistent attitude and they are adopting the de minimus approach in this case. I ask my right hon. Friend to take more time to try to resolve with the Commission what will be a real problem if the full rigour of the VAT law is applied to village halls.<br><br>
I am delighted to see that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General is here because I am going to talk about a village called Wadenhoe, which lies just beyond the west bank of the River Nene in Northamptonshire. The quirks of history are interesting: but for the second world war his father who had a distinguished career would have been the member of Parliament for Peterborough and my right hon. Friend would have known the beautiful Northamptonshire village intimately. It is a lovely village built in limestone as are all the villages in the region of Oundle. The chairman of the village hall committee, Group Captain Cooper has written to me. I shall read out his letter because it sets out the problems faced by small communities that have to raise large sums of money for village halls. Group Captain Cooper wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wadenhoe has had a wooden village hall since 1924, but we were advised five years ago that it had reached the end of its economic life. The villagers—and we number about 300 with the four nearby hamlets"—</p></blockquote>
all of which lie in the heart of my constituency—
<br><blockquote><p>"took the brave decision to raise about £30,000 which, with generous grants from the District and County Councils, and from the Rural Development Commission, would enable us to build a new Hall which must be in stone as we are in a particularly sensitive conservation area. Then last summer, when we were near enough to our fund raising target to be able to consider going out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
to tender for a new Hall, came the bombshell from the European Court. I have had the greatest difficulty in explaining to the villagers, and in many cases I am sure that I have not succeeded, that under the VAT rules if you so much as let the Hall for a child's birthday party you are deemed to be "in business" and therefore liable to VAT on the construction of a new Hall. The villagers see the facility, and all the fund raising they have done, as a means of maintaining the quality of rural life—we have no other communal facility—</p></blockquote>
although they do have a parish church, an excellent pub, and the surrounding countryside is some of the most beautiful in Britain—
<br><blockquote><p>"and indeed, several people have asked me what is the point of accepting the obligations of a registered charity if so doing gives no protection in matters such as this.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Our present fund raising shortfall looks to be around three or four thousand pounds, a large sum but one which we are confident we could handle. But if you add to this a VAT bill of (say) seven thousand pounds (assuming that the Councils would fund their share) it would be almost impossible to pay the interest on it let alone repay the capital. I know there are other options, and we are looking into them, but it is extremely worrying that if things stay as they are I am sure that some village halls will not be improved or rebuilt when this is necessary, leading to a further decline in the quality of rural life. We are going to get there in the end, regardless of the outcome, but it will mean asking a lot of many people who work entirely voluntarily for the good of their community."</p></blockquote>
That is what one village in my constituency faces. I represent 70 villages, many of which are very small and face problems similar to those described in the letter.<br><br>
I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is present because he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
knows the county of Northamptonshire as well as I do. The position in Northamptonshire in relation to village halls must be a microcosm of the nation. The county's local authorities provide grants for capital works for village halls. The budget is valuable and amounts to £170,000 this year. The extension of VAT to new building work on those village halls could reduce the available effective total by about £25,000. The average cost of a new village hall is about £100,000. Villages will have to find from voluntary fund-raising an extra £4,500 for each new facility. This year, not just Wadenhoe, but the village of Lilbourne, which is bigger than Wadenhoe but still has a population of only 350 people, must find £100,000 altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to confirm the impression given by my hon. Friend. In the southwest of the county we have the same problems, which are possibly more numerous because our villages are even more scattered. As a lawyer, could my hon. Friend speculate on the possibility of villages seeking to evade—or rather to avoid—such problems by inviting voluntary contributions instead of lettings? Would that be the type of subterfuge required to overcome that rather onerous provision?</span></p>
