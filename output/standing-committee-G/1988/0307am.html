	<br><blockquote><p>"(9A) Persons holding posts under local authorities in Scotland and Wales are exempted from the disqualifications and conditions applied to politically restricted posts by this section.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to remove local government officers in Scotland and Wales from the disqualifications associated with politically-restricted posts as defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are sound and democratic reasons for exempting Scottish local government officers. I shall concentrate on Scotland—my hon. Friends will speak later about Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By what democratic authority is this Bill, and the category of politically-restricted posts, imposed on Scottish local government officers? Only 10 out of 72 Scottish parliamentary seats are controlled by the Government. Sixty two out of 72 Scottish Members believe that local government issues of this kind should be decided upon not in this place but by a directly-elected Scottish assembly sitting in Edinburgh. Even if we accepted the Government's doctrine of a unitary Parliament, within that doctrine there has always been a tradition of dealing with Scottish business separately, especially matters such as local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House has always recognised that Scotland has an entirely separate system of local government,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
with its own structure, finance and traditions of public service. To reflect that recognition, the House has developed separate institutions for dealing with Scottish legislation. There are separate Scottish Standing Committees and Scottish Office Ministers. There used to be a separate Scottish Affairs Select Committee until the Government found it too embarrassing to allow it to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that tradition, this committee, which is debating a Bill which will affect thousands of local government officers in Scotland, contains not one Scottish Office Minister or Scottish conservative Back Bencher. There are only two Scottish Back Benchers in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke of thousands of Scottish local government officers. Is he really saying that thousands twin-track or are members of councils or that the Bill will stop that many people who may be considering going into local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that being in a politically-restricted post will not merely prevent someone from becoming a councillor. It will prevent people writing or speaking in public on politically controversial matters. Thousands of local government officers will be affected by such restrictions. The hon. Gentleman should read the Bill carefully before he supports it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here for every session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not mean that hon. Members listen, take part in or even understand what is going on, as has been evident in several speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many Scottish Members find it deeply offensive that this matter should be dealt with by a compendium Bill? Scotland still has its own legal system, which is based on a totally different concept and a different set of principles, which sit uneasily on United Kingdom-wide legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a fair point. The only reference that any Conservative Member has been able to make to the Scottish experience that might justify including Scotland in the Bill has been the example of the chief executive of Clydebank district council who is also a Glasgow district councillor. Apparently, that justifies the inclusion of Scotland in the Bill. Moreover, the tradition of dealing with Scottish matters separately through Scottish Standing Committees, which has always been the way of the House, has been ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the real reason for including Scotland in the Bill is the scarcity of Scottish Tory Back Benchers. They simply could not man a Standing Committee to deal with separate Scottish legislation because there are too many other Scottish Bills on the move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps talking about Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
representation on this Committee. It should be put on the record that, originally, there were no Opposition Members from Wales or Scotland on the Committee. Only when the Opposition saw that two Welsh Conservative Members were on the Committee did they request, through the Government Whips, the inclusion of a Scottish and a Welsh Member. If the Opposition had got their act together, they would have realised from the start that the Bill covers Scotland and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have consistently argued for Scottish representation on the proceedings of this Bill. I notice that there is no Scottish representation on the Conservative Benches. That sums up the Government's attitude to Scotland and explains why there will not be even 10 Tory Scottish Back Benchers after the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman's failing to turn up for his Adjournment debate last night reveal his own attitude towards such matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now going far too wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman well knows that not only did I turn up, but I was one of the few Members to sit in the Chamber throughout four hours of debate on the Bill relating to education in Scotland and one and a half hours of debate on the poll tax regulations relating to Scotland. I turned up for my Adjournment debate but, because of the manoeuvres of the Government Whips, the Adjournment debate was lost. I am nevertheless confident that Mr. Speaker will recognise the dirty, underhand manoeuvres that went on and that my Adjournment debate will take place as it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the Committee again to return to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just responding to the taunts from Conservative Members, Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is important. It does not affect just chief officers—it affects any local government officer who earns more than £13,500 a year. According to the Minister, an appeal procedure will allow many local government officers to be exempted from the restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(3) defines the kind of officer who earns more than £13,500 who will not be exempt from such restrictions. Subsection (3)(a) refers to those
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving advice on a regular basis…to any committee or sub-committee"</p></blockquote>
within the council. That covers a wide range of officers who have no real influence on policy. Subsection (3)(b) relates to anyone who acts on behalf of the authority when dealing with the media or the press. It would also include officers who do not influence councillors but merely reflect in the media
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
what councillors and the council wish. Paragraph (c) relates to officers who have contact with the public. That takes in many officers and thus affects their civil rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, clause 2(3) would cover local government officers such as housing, press, environmental health, roads department and education officers. It is already causing widespread anxiety among local government officers in Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has passed to me a letter from a councillor in Strathkelvin district council. He wrote to his local Member of Parliament saying that he is employed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a Structural Engineer with Glasgow District Council. This is a technical post having no input into the running of the council"</p></blockquote>
but it earns him more than £13,500 per year. In his letter, he said that the Bill contains a provision for the Secretary of State to appoint:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an independent person who will determine who is not in a 'politically sensitive' position. In the White Paper issued last June the 'Technical Officer' was cited as someone who would not hold a politically sensitive post."</p></blockquote>
That subject must be probed further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say clearly whether the provision on politically restricted posts will cover technical officers. I hope that he will say that all technical officers will be exempt from that restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be serious consequences for any local government officer who is placed in the restricted category. We have already dealt with the problem of twin-tracking, and said that local government officers will not be allowed to stand for election as councillors in any other authority. All the Minister's examples came from England, not Wales or Scotland. There are examples in Scotland of local government officers being elected councillors in other authorities, but the Minister cannot point to any abuse that has arisen from that. If the Minister is serious about placing these severe restrictions on Scottish local government officers, he ought first to give examples of abuse in Scotland which justify it. He has not been able to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also find it strange that local government officers should be denied the opportunity to stand for Parliament or for the European Parliament. I should like to understand why. The Minister's only argument so far is that the general public might believe that they would be campaigning for a political party in council time while being paid by the council. I fail to understand why this type of measure needs to be taken to prevent that. Surely it would be a simple matter to ensure that local government officers who take part in political activity or stand for Parliament or the European Parliament take unpaid time off from their work. It is preposterous that local government officers should be singled out and have their civil rights infringed in this way while almost every other type of employee will be able to take part in such activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other serious political restrictions which will have a special effect in Scotland. For example, local government officers will not be allowed to speak or write publicly about politically controversial matters. Last Saturday, members of the National and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
Local Government Officers Association collected signatures in Dundee city square for a petition against the privatisation of the electricity boards in Scotland. All sorts of local government officers where there. I, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) and the Lord Provost for Dundee signed the petition and took part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that the type of activity which will be restricted by the Bill? Will NALGO be unable to go onto the streets and campaign against the privatisation of the electricity industry because it is seen to be a politically controversial matter? Will local government officers who earn more than £13,500 be unable to take part in democratic demonstrations in city squares in Scotland against matters which affect them and their families and the rest of the people in Scotland? That would be a serious infringement of civil liberties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked about local government officers who might wish to be represented as parents on school boards, the Minister seemed to give an assurance that nothing would interfere with their rights as parent members of school boards, but what would happen if the school board came into conflict with a Conservative local authority? It may be in conflict about opting out or closure. Parent members of school boards who are local government officers may want to go to the media, write to local newspapers, attend demonstrations and stand on platforms to attack a Tory council. Would that be allowed under the Bill, or would it be prohibited because they are deemed unable to take part in politically controversial activity? It would be politically controversial to attack Tory councillors—I hope that the Minister accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other restriction which completely mystifies me is that against local government officers canvassing for political parties or holding office in any political party. It has to be assumed that they can join any political party, go to branch meetings and take part in them behind closed doors. It may also be assumed that they are even allowed to appear in public with their party when they are campaigning and to have their picture taken with local candidates or local officers of the party. They can be seen to be active members of the party, but they will not be allowed to knock on anyone's door to tell them that or to hold any sort of elected post in the party. That seems an entirely absurd set of circumstances which will lead to all sorts of anomalies. The Bill does not spell out what, as members of political parties, they will or will not be able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major purpose of the amendment is to question the democratic authority by which the Bill is being imposed on Scotland and Wales. The House represents a sort of parliamentary facade—a cloak of democracy which gives the impression that democracy reigns and that people get what they vote for through the House. The Bill will go through further stages here and in the House of Lords before it receives Royal Assent and passes into law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may believe that a genuine debate has taken place and that there has been serious analysis of the Bill's implications for Scotland and Scottish local government. People may even believe that the votes and decisions reached during
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
parliamentary proceedings will be arrived at by hon. Members listening to the arguments and deciding how to vote on their merits rather than on party lines. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened in Committee has been a sham. There has been nothing democratic about the debate, especially in relation to Scotland and Wales. Its genesis is Tory paranoia about local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating the Bill; we are debating the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment considers why the Bill relates to Scotland. The reason is Tory paranoia about local government in England. The Government know nothing of local government in Scotland. They cannot understand it and they cannot give reasons why the Bill should apply to Scotland.

I do not know enough about English local government to justify my suggesting what should be done here. I am not qualified to do that. Tory Members, however, think that they have the experience, depth of knowledge and understanding necessary to impose on local government and on Scottish and Welsh people Bills and restrictions which they do not want and see no reason for. That fact lies at the root of our amendment. Someone on the Government Bench will have to justify the Bill's application to Scotland. I see no relevance, justification or democratic authority for it. The whole thing is a sham which would be kicked out by a Committee which consisted of genuine democrats.

Kingdom Parliament and the Labour party did not stand on the separatist platform that it now suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks about the Committee's right to discuss Scottish government. We were elected as the United Kingdom Government by the public of the United Kingdom, and we have an absolute right to debate legislation affecting all parts of the United Kingdom. The amendment will affect Scotland as well as Wales, and it is right to do so because we have already heard about abuses in Scottish local government. My right hon. Friend quoted the example of the chief executive, and there have been examples in Welsh local government of chief executives being involved in party politics. The law should be equal across all parts of Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East is talking nonsense. The Labour Front Bench includes spokesmen from Scotland who comment on English matters. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) speaks on Home Office matters, and the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), for Livingston (Mr. Cook), and for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) speak on English health matters. If they really believed that we should discuss only legislation affecting England, they would not appoint their own Front Benchers to debate matters affecting English Departments of State. Time and again, Opposition Members take up the separatist cause when it is a matter of their own self interest, but they think that they are entitled to poke their noses into other people's business with impunity. If we have a rule to say that we may not discuss Scotland, we cannot have Scots and Welsh Members discussing matters of state affecting English Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe in separatism. As a Welsh Member of Parliament, I believe that I am entitled to debate matters that affect the United Kingdom, and I am not prepared to allow the hon. Member for Dundee, East to take away my basic right as a Member of Parliament to discuss matters affecting the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

discuss matters in the Bill that affect Scotland and Wales, but if my research is right, the hon. Member for Pemborke would not be allowed to be a Member of Parliament, let alone a member of the Committee discussing the Bill, if this legislation were enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Any past employment of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) can hardly have a connection with the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. That was my concern, and I must rule accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never object to the presence of English Members on these Committees because it gives them an opportunity for education. We may have a unitary state, but it is one in which there are separate and distinct legal jurisdictions. That is an inevitable consequence, as Conservative historians will know, of the Act of Union 1707, part of which required that the separate institutions of Scotland—in particular, the separate legal systems—should be maintained, and those institutions necessarily involve local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the one contribution that we had from Conservative Members, the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) failed to address the very proper distinction that was drawn between what happens in England and Wales and what happens in Scotland. He said that there is a quite separate system in terms of levels of government and the number of people at each level. He seemed to imply that the major reform of local government in the United Kingdom that was carried out in the early 1970s was effected in Scotland by a separate Scottish Act. Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and me, are worried that experience south of the border is being used to justify decisions that apply on both sides of the border, when there is no Scottish experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) talked of abuse. He said that the chief executive of one local authority was a member of another. The hon. Gentleman used the word "abuse", and no doubt he used it advisedly. I respectfully suggest that an abuse requires to be justified by the provision of evidence to the effect that impropriety has occurred. It is notable that, while examples of alleged impropriety south of the border have been flying around the Committee, on no occasion has any member of the ministerial team or any Conservative Member given an example of anyone holding a dual position which has led to impropriety in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other justification that has been offered is that the public may fail to have confidence if there is twin-tracking, but no example has been given of the public in Scotland failing to have confidence in a person who has fulfilled a dual responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to remove from certain individuals the right to exercise a freedom which other people in the community retain. When one embarks on that innovation on people's freedom, it is morally—perhaps legally—desirable, to provide eloquent and compelling evidence to justify it. We have been given
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
no such evidence in relation to Scotland. No attempt has been made to recognise the distinct and different system of local government in Scotland and, whether or not the hon. Member for Pembroke likes it, the impression will be given that this is an attempt by an English dominated unitary Parliament to impose upon Scotland remedies for ills and evils that do not exist. That is what worries people in Scotland and why they find this kind of approach offensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a shred of evidence to justify the extension of these provisions to Scotland. For that reason, the amendment should be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Ian Grist)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very tempted, as one of the former three secretaries of the union group during the last Labour Government, to go tracking after some of those arguments, but I shall refrain from doing so other than to recollect that, 10 years ago, St. David's day provided the opportunity for the election that led inexorably to my party sitting on this side of the Committee for 10 years. Opposition Members may like to consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) advanced two arguments. The first was one that we have heard before and will no doubt hear many times again, but it does not improve with telling. The hon. Gentleman said that, if this legislation is to be introduced, it should be contained in separate Scottish legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) dealt with that most effectively. The considerations which lead to separate legislation on Scottish local government matters are, and always have been, purely practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a Bill can deal with matters that are essentially the same in England, Scotland and Wales, with only minor variations in relation to its application, it is sensible and convenient to proceed in that way. If the necessary variations are occasionally too numerous, we can, as in clauses 11 and 12, have separate provisions for England, Wales and Scotland. If separate issues have to be dealt with, or if variations are so many as to make for cumbersome and confusing legislation, there is a case for wholly separate legislation, but that is certainly not the case here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that a reason for separate measures north and south of the border would relate to evidence to justify different measures in both parts of the Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would imagine that, in general, the application of law relates to whether an offence is being committed. There must be islands off Scotland where rape is almost, if not entirely, unknown, yet there is a law against it, and rightly so. Where considerations justify separate legislation, we are willing that they should be dealt with in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second question raised by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, I accept that there are some cross-border differences in local government matters, as did the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell), but I do not believe that any such differences are relevant to the purposes of parts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
I and II. All local authorities in Great Britain are elected bodies, all operate on the basis of delegation to committees and sub-committees, and all are served by professional officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6.205 of the Widdicombe report quoted the evidence of the Local Authorities conditions of Service Advisory Board, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The underlying assumption behind all the national agreements is that senior local government officers should be politically neutral."</p></blockquote>
The point of the committee's recommendations and of these provisions is that underlying assumptions are no longer adequate for regulating conduct in local government. It would make no sense to suggest that statutory rules to replace unwritten conventions are required in some areas but not in others. The extent to which there is more or less cause for concern in one area as compared with another is irrelevant. The same conventions apply throughout Great Britain and it seems obvious to me that the proposed statutory rules should have similar application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had there been any justification for different rules for Scottish or Welsh local authorities, I am sure that the Widdicombe committee would have so recommended. In fact there is no justification for the rules to be applied to some local authorities and not to others, or for different rules to be devised for different authorities anywhere in Great Britain. It follows that there is no justification for the amendments and I urge the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> People in Scotland are angered by the cavalier way in which the Government treat the Scottish people in legislation. The Government, who cannot get a mandate in Scotland, slip into English and Welsh Bills large pieces of legislation that affect Scotland dramatically. They did it with the Housing Bill and they have done it with this Bill and others. The people of Scotland rightly feel that the Government are using the mechanism for England and Wales to legislate for Scotland because they cannot do so through the Scottish Grand Committee in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two serious problems with the Government's approach. First, the Government are eroding the parliamentary system that has been built up over many years. Secondly, they are playing into the separatists' hands. When people in Scotland ask, "How did this legislation come about?", there is only one answer, irrespective of whether it is given by a Labour, Liberal or Tory politician, or by someone from another party. The legislation came about because the Government put it in an English and Welsh Bill. If a Scottish individual then asks, "So it didn't go through the Scottish Grand Committee procedure?" the answer must be, "No, it didn't."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Minister says, if the Government continue to legislate for Scotland in this way they will fuel separatist feeling in Scotland, which is profoundly serious for the whole nation. We must congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and the Social and Liberal Democrats for raising the issue as it needs to be expressed clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I test the Minister on the concept of convention, Mr. Hunt? A convention derives force from the fact that people accept it and act in implementation of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite invitations from the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and me, the Minister has been uanble to offer a specific instance of abuse or impropriety in Scotland. That must mean that according to the Government's evidence the convention is being observed in Scotland. If so, surely that is precisely the sort of circumstance in which there is no justification for extending legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the hon. Member for Dundee, East an example, if he is looking for one. The Government are about to introduce a Bill to deal with football supporters in England and Wales. They do not intend to introduce similar provisions for Scotland. They recognise that although the game is the same north and south of the border, the circumstances are different. We are discussing precisely the sort of instance in which for constitutional reasons, and probably for political reasons, the Government should be sensitive enough to understand that circumstances in Scotland are different, that convention is being observed and that, consequently, there is no justification for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the reasons for not having separate Scottish legislation were purely practical because the issues covered by the Bill were essentially the same in Scotland, Wales and England. He has failed pitifully to establish the case that the issues in Scotland are the same as in England and Wales. All the examples have been from English local government. No one has been able to point to any aspect of Scottish local government affairs that would justify the application of clause 2 to Scottish local government officers. It is important to stress that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, the Minister claimed that there is no justification for treating Scotland differently. He entirely ignores the concept that any measure that is pushed through the House of Commons to affect the people should at least be based on democratic consent, and there is no democratic consent in Scotland. The Minister spoke of the referendum of 10 years ago, since when, he says, the fortunes of the Conservative party have risen and the Government have established themselves firmly as the main political party in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What he forgets to reflect upon are the Conservative party's fortunes in Scotland since 1979. Since then, the Scottish people have consistently turned away from the party. In the 1983 and 1987 general elections, they moved away because there was no democratic consent for their imposition of legislation such as this in Scotland, and because the Government have repeatedly ignored the Scottish dimension when they pushed legislation through Parliament and applied it to Scotland without initially considering the reality of Scottish experience. That reaction and experience is not reflected in any Bill, whether for the United Kingdom or for Scotland alone. I would prefer a separate Bill for Scotland in this instance. There is separate Scottish legislation,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
but Scottish Members' views are not taken into account when a majority of English Members pushes through measures in support of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Conservative party was perhaps the only party in Scotland at the last general election that supported the concept of unitary government so that a unitary United Kingdom Parliament could legislate for all parts of the United Kingdom. I remind Tory Members of the support that they received from Scotland for that platform. It was not merely that 24 per cent. voted Conservative at the last election, only 18 per cent. of the Scottish electorate did so. That is hardly a basis upon which to go forward claiming democratic consent for imposing legislative proposals on Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) may claim that I am inconsistent in defending the right of Scottish Members to attend Home Office Questions and participate in Home Office debates. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Home Office still enacts legislation that affects Scottish people and that, as long as it does so, Scottish Members have every right to be represented and to participate. The hon. Gentleman said that we should not participate in debates that do not affect Scotland? I remind him that as long as the Government refuse the Scottish people their right to have a Scottish Assembly to debate Scottish matters and continue with a unitary Parliament, each hon. Member has a right to participate in any business. We aim to change the nature of this Parliament so that it reflects democractically the wishes of the people of all the nations that form the United Kingdom. For that reason, we demand a Scottish Assembly. I am sure that, in time, English people will see the wisdom of our demand and will demand their own regional assemblies to deal with their own matters separately, so that Scottish Members cannot participate. Until they do, they will not stop us demanding what we want. We want a Scottish Assembly to make decisions on Scottish local government. We want the Scottish people to decide what restrictions are placed on their local government officers. That has been denied by the Bill and by the Government majority in Committee. Any genuine democrats on the Government Benches will join us in supporting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grist</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

Gentleman keeps pestering for an example; the chief executive of Clydebank was a councillor on Glasgow city council, but one does not need an instance to see that a principle is or is not correct. The hon. Gentleman follows a dangerous constitutional route. He should have a long talk with his hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) an assurance that we take account of the differences that he mentioned. For example, parts III and V do not apply to Scotland. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland requires more time to consult local government about matters to which the provisions relate and may, in due course, bring forward different provisions which apply to Scotland. He has had no representations about parts I and II or in the way in which we propose to deal with matters which relate to them. The Government are alert to the differences raised by the hon.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 3, leave out lines 30 to 39.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: Nos. 30, page 3, line 32, after "remuneration", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"excluding any special allowance, addition or weighting".</p></blockquote>
No. 70, in page 3, line 34, after "£13,500", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"uprated in line with the agreed minimum of the National Grade of Principal Officers."</p></blockquote>
No. 31, in page 3, line 39, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any amount specified by order under this paragraph shall include, in respect of employees entitled to receive it, an amount equivalent to any additional weighting allowance in respect of London or any other area."</p></blockquote>
No. 29, in page 3, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) The Secretary of State shall increase the amount stipulated in subsection (1)(h)(i) above in each year by a percentage amount equal to any increase made to local authority Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical scales."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to remove the reference to the sum of £13,500 from politically-restricted posts so that the decision to whom the restrictions will apply will not be determined simply by salary. The category is based on salary applies restrictions which were originally recommended by the Widdicombe report solely for principal officers and, as a consequence, is extremely wide ranging. The intention, and the practical result, will be to include everyone, from the lowest principal officer grade, with a salary of £13,477. The reality is that many others will be caught if they receive additional payments such as London weighting, bonuses, overtime or higher paid manual work. The fact that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
the Bill does not refer to those payments makes it appear unprofessional in relation to personnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of a proper approach in that respect and the absence of any consideration of London weighting will result in a disproportionate number of council workers in London being included within the politically-restricted category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill uses the phrase, "annual rate of remuneration" instead of, for example, "basic annual wage or salary", which means that many low-paid or junior jobs will necessarily be included if extra duties result in bonuses, overtime or other additional remuneration such as luncheon vouchers or the provision of a car or petrol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using a restriction based on salary rather than on the grade of the person against whom the restriction is directed contradicts the criteria applied in the earlier part of subsection (1). What is the point of using an arbitrary basis such as salary when, if the measure is necessary—a subject on which there is severe division of opinion—job definitions and grading would be far more appropriate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might also be considered that, as the Bill only allows staff in that category to apply for exemption, the Government recognise that it is that area which is likely to give rise to the greatest difficulties. Therefore, I believe that the amendment should command the Committee's support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, amendments Nos. 31 and 29 deserve support. The proposals clearly define a method of increase in the figure for
	<br><blockquote><p>"Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clinical scales."</p></blockquote>
I understand "Clinical" is a typographical error for the word "Clerical".

As I said, the proposals define a method of increase in the figure for those scales and also allow for London weighting. Those two amendments or amendment No. 70 would formalise any rise in accordance with inflation or wage and salary increases; the figure would be altered not at the whim of the Secretary of State but in accordance with the rise in remuneration at that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a Bill which gives the Secretary of State considerable discretionary powers, it would be an unnecessary addition to give him sole discretion about the figure to be established. A malign Secretary of State, and the possibility of such a person in office cannot be excluded, in a period of roaring inflation, another possibility that cannot be excluded, could simply hold the figure at £13,500 and indulge in a continuing increase in the numbers caught by the provision. Therefore, in the interests of democratic procedures and especially of those whose freedom is being taken away, it is necessary to have a means by which the figure of £13,500 is altered automatically and not at the whim or discretion of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 and amendments Nos. 30, 31 and 29 relate to politically restricted posts. The restrictions to be placed on those in local government are severe and the numbers who will be caught by them substantial. Our amendments would ensure that proper provision is made for people who could be included in the politically restricted posts category.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses describe the final category. Paragraphs (a) to (f) of clause 2(1) relate to various categories. As the notes on clauses state, the final category is local authority officers who are paid at an annual rate of £13,500 or above. That category also covers part-time office holders whose pay, if calculated on a full-time basis, would bring them into the £13,500 bracket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments draw attention to the fact that the Secretary of State is given power by order, made by statutory instrument, to raise the figure of £13,500, if he so wishes. If the clause is unamended, for years or even decades the Secretary of State will not be required to increase that figure. That could result in a purge on those employed in local government whose income will have not increased, for the purposes of the legislation, for many years. That would be unfair, inhuman and not in the best interests of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention according to the notes, is that the figure will be kept at about the minimum of the national grade of principal officer. Those are not my or my colleagues' words, but the Department's. If that is the intention, why not include such a provision in the Bill? We are told that the intention of giving the Secretary of State such powers is to keep the figure increased in line with remunerations increases. If we accept the spirit behind the Department's notes, why not include such a provision so that those who have not been involved in drafting or debating the Bill will know what was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be in everyone's interests to include such a provision in the Bill and to ensure equity for local government officers in different parts of the country—for example, in the inner and outer-London areas where the cost of living is high and where it can be difficult to obtain accommodation. People employed in London have to pay extra for accommodation and other necessities and are therefore entitled to a weighting in their remuneration to meet those extra costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 would ensure equity for officers in London, out of London and in other areas where high living costs are recognised by additional payments and for those in jobs with particular requirements that make extra remuneration necessary—for example, those who must work unsociable hours. That applies not only in London but throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority officers who must work unsociable hours attract additional remuneration which will take them above £13,500. Others are compensated for working substantial overtime. Those people are in lower income brackets. The politically restricted posts now go down to manual workers and lower paid groups whose basic salary is not £13,500 if overtime and unsociable hours premiums are included. That is unfair. If London weighting is not excluded, there will be a major discrepancy between which officers are affected. The same applies with regard to overtime and unsociable hours premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to be honest and fair to people who work in local government, amendment No. 30 should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
considered seriously by Conservative Members because it shows that a substantial number of officers—other than the 70,000 who have been mentioned—could be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult to recruit officers to fill higher grade jobs in London and elsewhere if we do not take that important point into consideration. Surely it is wrong if advisers for the elderly, who could fall within the £13,500 bracket, are in politically restricted posts? Likewise, people who serve on joint committees could fall into this bracket. There is now a great deal of involvement with health authorities and community care, and such people could suddenly be caught in the politically restricted trap because they meet members of the public to give advice and to speak about the policy of local authorities. They will not be able to help in elections, and they will be prevented from speaking their minds on issues that are political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is even more absurd that housing interviewers or home help supervisors who go to meet people in communities, and other officers who are required to make a professional assessment—the Minister referred to education advisers—will be brought into this politically restricted bracket simply because they receive remuneration above £13,500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) mentioned people who would have restricted posts. In my constituency, a post has been advertised for a crematorium superintendent and registrar for the central Durham crematorium at a salary of £13,800 a year. Whoever takes that post will be politically restricted. I cannot help wondering who the Government think he will influence politically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Perhaps the Secretary of State will be able to communicate with the people with whom the crematorium superintendent is involved: I have no doubt that the Secretary of State could walk on water and do many other things if he were given the necessary powers in the Bill. We want to expose the powers that will be given to the Secretary of State if some of the amendments are not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause represents a potentially severe curb on the civil liberties of a wide range of local government employees and we must ensure that they understand their position. The local government ombudsman safeguards the interests of people in the community. They can go to him if they believe that there has been maladministration, which could mean political involvement. A code of conduct already exists in local government. It should be allowed to apply without these legislative restrictions. They are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that local government staff must ensure that they have no political bias in carrying out their jobs. We think that the matter is covered. It was highlighted by Widdicombe and other people. It is unnecessary for this legislation to put such people into a politically restricted bracket. The inclusion of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
a salary limit is irregular and deviates from the Widdicombe report. The Minister has been advised in previous sittings that the legislation is being presented in this form because of the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want clause 2 to be withdrawn. It is unnecessary. If it is not withdrawn, however, this group of amendments says much about the intrigue and scheming planned by the Secretary of State and Conservative Members against local government officers and local government members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the 50th Bill in a long line of Government attacks on local government and democracy that have centralised power on Marsham street and the Secretary of State. The Bill only follows previous Bills in centralising power so that the Government control the workings of local government. In my opinion, the Secretary of State has little or no respect for local government. He has worked for and engineered the demise of local authorities and shown no compassion or feeling for the people which local government serves. The Bill is a further attack on the democracy that existed before 1979 when the Government were first elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 seeks to ensure that, if we must endure a salary or wage barrier, it should be the basic figure and not include allowances such as bonuses, weighting, overtime premiums or unsocial hours payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory notes issued by the Department for the Environment state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 2 implements the White Paper proposals, with an amendment to include a third category of restricted post. It proposes that the restrictions on public political activity should also apply to all other local authority staff to whom the Widdicombe committee recommended that they should apply, that is staff in the grade of principal officer or above. As there is no uniform local authority grading structure across local government a single remuneration figure of £13,500 is proposed".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current minimum of the national recommended scale for principal officer is £13,477."</p></blockquote>
There is an anomaly, and the explanatory notes highlight issues that are important enough to warrant a change in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the final category of posts, as opposed to the first six categories set out in clause 2, to which the paragraph that I quoted applies. Amendment No. 30 would remove uncertainty and ensure that there is a clear-cut decision about remuneration. The notes tell us that local authorities have a duty to maintain a list of posts to meet the criteria specified in clause 3, which girates around such phrases as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may appoint",</p></blockquote>
or he "may so determine" or that he may do so
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the consent of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
Much is left to the Secretary of State, and there is much doubt about his purpose. The Bill should include an explanation of what is meant by remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to the Secretary of State's power is to be found in the notes where they say that the Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
of State can specify other posts which need not be included in the list. He will have a wide sphere of influence which we cannot accept and which, in our view, is undemocratic and cruel to people who are employees in local government. People who have the interests of local goverment at heart cannot accept the powers that are assumed for the Secretary of State in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criterion for the other posts is the remuneration that they offer. In amendment No. 31, we seek to insert the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any amount specified by order under this paragraph shall include, in respect of employees entitled to receive it, an amount equivalent to any additional weighting allowance in respect of London or any other area."</p></blockquote>
In other words, if weighting is allowed for part-time workers, the £13,500 should be increased to cover London weighting, extra remuneration for unsocial hours and overtime. If this group of workers are members of a political party, I see no reason why their personal activities should debar them from taking part in the politics of their communities. As I said earlier, it is possible that they may not be members of a political party, but that their children or spouses are. Is it right or fair that, because they are in the £13,500 bracket and therefore on the politically restricted list, a father or mother, brother or sister cannot help a member of the family in a political campaign?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that what his father did when he entered politics was correct, but that does not apply in all cases. Consideration should be given to the politically restricted bracket and a further assessment should be made of the democratic principles that should apply throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when a political bill is put in the window of a house that is owned by a principal officer on a salary of £13,500-plus? Who takes the rap for that? The person who lives there could say, "I'm not involved in politics; it is your house. The fact that there is a political bill in your window means that you can influence people who go to see you in the town hall or who you visit out in the community."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens to the woman whose husband is campaigning? While she is out visiting old people in the area, she may be asked, "How's your husband doing in the campaign?" She may reply, "I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it"? What impression does that give? That stupid situation is the result of these politically restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Bradford, even now, the Tory-controlled corporation is telling voluntary organisations that they can have no more financial assistance from the local authority. Someone has to tell the voluntary organisations, and it will not be the chief executive; it will be someone in a lower income bracket. There could be untold hardship for council officers who are put into that situation by their political masters. I am not kite flying. It is something that will and does happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman, and I entirely accept that a number of the questions that he has raised demand answers, but the point that he made about Bradford stretches

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
credulity to breaking point, because that is not how it would work in practice. As I think the hon. Gentleman, on reflection, will agree, an announcement that some support is to be withdrawn by the city council would be made by the elected representatives, and that would apply to any council, whoever was in control of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is correct but, as he knows, £13,500 is not a high level of remuneration. In Bradford, officers are being told to give directions as a result of the council's policies, and it will be clear as we progress through the Bill that the officers will have greater powers and will therefore be the front-line people. When councils make decisions—for instance, about the withdrawal of assistance to charities—it will be the officers who have to tell the people who are affected. We have the example of what is happening in the House of Commons concerning political activities in Bradford and early-day motion 491. The amendment to the early-day motion was brought about not by hon. Members from Bradford but by an hon. Member who lives 200 miles from Bradford. It is clear that there are other forces at play that will influence the outcome of the Bill if it is not amended to ensure that innocent people are not caught by the provision on politically restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that people will challenge the Bill under the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain is a signatory and whose principles Britain accepts, because of the restriction on certain people who have a right to express views, to campaign regardless of their political status, to address public meetings and to help in campaigns. If the Bill is not amended, I believe that the convention will be used to expose its unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On first examination, the Government's proposals to prevent individuals from canvassing or publicly expressing political views contravene the European Convention on Human Rights. Only a court challenge can resolve that issue ultimately and legally, but to propose action which cuts across the principles of the convention is a very serious step for the Government to take, and Conservative members should take note of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments have been tabled that seek to provide protection. Amendment No. 29 says that any increase in remuneration to local government officers, either annually or on some other basis, should apply to £13,500 without the need for the Secretary of State to give consideration under a statutory instrument. The amendment says that the Bill itself should provide that there is an automatic increase in the figure when increases come along. If inflation is high—8 or 9 per cent. as it is now—it should be taken into account. Local government officers should not be the victims of high inflation. We do not believe that it should be left to the Secretary of State to say that because inflation is 8 per cent., for example, the figure of £13,500 should not be increased. Parliament should decide that and the matter should be covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 31 cannot be accepted, we shall press for amendment No. 29 to be accepted. It would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
ensure that any increase that arose would be automatically applied and the limit reviewed without regard to the Secretary of State's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of people in "sensitive positions" and of "a junior education adviser." We are told that it is the job of local authorities to group together officers dealing with members of the public who might conclude that the officers could affect the authority's decision. I have remarked that a number of officers, apart from the education officer, whom the Minister mentioned, could be brought into that category. Because the remuneration of employees can fluctuate the issue should be considered seriously. Our amendments relate to this matter and the Minister ought to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other factors should be considered. Tradespeople work for local authorities and their income fluctuates, often because of seasonal adjustments, accident or illness. A person who is employed by a local authority may increase his remuneration to more than £13,500 because of overtime and other payments. However the following year his income may reduce to £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000. In the first year a person would be on the politically restricted list, in the second year, he would not. Therefore he would be able to participate in the campaign. Again we have the stupid situation that one year a person would be allowed to take part and have a poster in his window, but in the second year, because of overtime and unsociable hours payments, the restrictions would apply. How can this be allowed to happen? The Bill as drafted allows it. All hon. Members will have constituents in that category. We should give serious thought to this important part of the Bill which relates to politically restricted posts and consider the question of how the provision will apply to manual workers whose incomes would be increased for seasonal reasons or because the amount of work done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to see how the Government propose to define "sensitive posts" within a politically restricted group. I put it to the Minister that the examples that I have given leave a big question mark over the definition. The White Paper refers to those
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose duties involve, in a regular basis, offering advice to members, contact with the public, communicating with the media, or exercising a delegated discretion in the provision of services."</p></blockquote>
There is a realistic and startling example in the way in which Bradford corporation is reorganising and applying its political dogma in the city of Bradford. The term "sensitive posts" needs to be defined and I hope that the Minister will define it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments are not intended to wreck the Bill. They propose a constructive approach to issues that we consider important. I have given examples that highlight the problems which will emerge if the Bill proceeds unamended. My experience of local government tells me that the points that I have raised will show themselves in local authorities which have a list of politically restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments were tabled with sincerity and were based on our experience of local government. I hope that the Minister will accept them in the spirit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
in which they were tabled because our proposals are in the best interests of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief. The determination of £13,500 is arbitrary and falls within the senior officers' grades of administrative, professional, technical and clerical scales. Furthermore, a fixed salary level as low as £13,500 a year does not reflect the wide differences in responsibilities between officers in a large authority and those in a much smaller authority. The cut-off point for automatic restriction must be within at least the principal officers' grade, which would much more accurately reflect the lowest grade at which an officer is likely to influence a council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to seriously consider our proposals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said, these are not wrecking amendments. They are tabled seriously by people with years of experience in local government. I served on a local authority for 12 years and can see the folly of a restriction of £13,500 a year. It will catch hundreds of local government officers who have no influence on their local authorities or on the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have an arbitrary figure, there should be provision for the Secretary of State to increase it by law. I hope that the Government will not set an arbitrary figure and that they will see sense and amend the Bill to remove the £13,500 limit. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to do so. Accordingly, I ask them to consider that the Secretary of State should increase the stipulated figure each year by a percentage equal to any increase in APT and C salary scales, which would be a sensible, commonsense step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is obvious. They would avoid a repetition of limit fixing which, as hon. Members may remember, was applied to higher earnings for taxation purposes in 1978 or 1979. The limit then was about £8,500 and it remains in force today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the £13,500 restriction was fixed in local government, almost all local authority staff would be restricted in or excluded from political activity, which would be daft. I can only assume that the Government do not wish that to happen and that they are trying to introduce legislation that they believe is fair to the general public. It would certainly not be fair if every employee of local government was automatically excluded. That would make the Bill even dafter than it is now. I hope that the Government note what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) and agreed with certain parts of his remarks, especially when he said that these provisions were wide-ranging. They are intended to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East referred to London weighting when speaking of regional differences. If we had considered allowing regional, or sub-regional or district council differences, the Bill would have been incredibly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
complex. Moreover, I have not the slightest doubt that Opposition parties would have been the first to criticise their complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East was right and fair in saying that the proposals we took on board were the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee. It is interesting to note, however, that no one has criticised an individual member of that committee. Personally, I believe that each one is above criticism because none of the five members of the Widdicombe committee has any political affiliation. I tried to ascertain whether anyone has, but failed, If any hon. Member can improve on that, I hope he will try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East may find it helpful if I remind him and the Committee that a distinguished member of the Widdicombe committee, Sir Lawrence Boyd—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—the hon. and learned Gentleman says that he knows him well—was the chief executive of South Clyde for a considerable time. I suspect—the hon. Gentleman will know better than me—that he served under a Labour administration during much of the time that he held that office. I make that point to emphasise that there was a voice on that committee for Scotland. That is not a heavy point, but it has not been made during our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee recommended that the measure should be wide ranging. We have accepted that. The committee chose principal officer grade and above, and it did not recommend any form of weighting either for London or for any other region. If it had done so it would have made it incredibly complicated and difficult to deal with the issue, certainly for adjudication officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way and also for the reasoned response he is making to the amendment. Does he agree that one way to avoid the difficulties we are discussing is to establish the grade at which the provisions are to bite rather than the salary, which will inevitably be subject to the fluctuations that have been highlighted by Opposition Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Grades can also disappear. There are no common grades. In fact, there is movement away from a common grading procedure whereby it is the Government's intention to consider grading structures to be dealt with at district council level. Therefore, grading will become more complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair for the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East to say that the provisions are wide ranging and will catch about 70,000 local government officers in the net. But, to put that in proportion, that is only 3 per cent. of all employees in local government. Given that there are substantial regional pay variations, which we accept, a uniform system of allowances is likely to make the picture less uniform than at present. We considered that factor, and others, in setting the threshold and decided that a definitive figure at an appropriate level was the best way to ensure that the system operated fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect that the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East will accept that. It may have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
remain a difference of opinion between the two of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not said that all those who are paid more than £13,500 will be covered by a blanket approach. They will all have the opportunity to be exempted if they so wish. We have strenuously resisted a blanket approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 29 would require the Secretary of State to increase the £13,500 threshold each year by a percentage amount equal to any increase made to local authority APTG scales. We object to the amendment as APTG scales could be replaced by other grading scales. If that happens—I say this to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien)—we would require primary legislation. However, the Bill, as drafted, eradicates that eventuality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for letting me make this point. At present, there is no proposal to change the salary structure. If the Minister knows something that we do not, he should inform the Committee. If not, we should adhere to the principles we have and ensure that protection is provided for those employed in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I chose my words carefully. I made it clear that there could be a change. I did not say that there would be or even that there should be. I used the word "could". If that could happen, and it meant introducing primary legislation to change what we are, and shall be considering during the coming months that would be entirely unacceptable. I know that the hon. Member for Normanton would also regard that as unacceptable because it would mean going round the same track again. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman or his hon. Friends cardiac arrests by letting them think that we are considering a secret plot in a smoke-filled room, or anything else. That is not our intention at the moment.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] However uncharacteristic that may be, I can assure hon. Members that we are not considering that at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to the effect of restrictions on public political activity on recruitment to the local authority service. None of the organisations—there have been many—which has commented on our proposals has suggested that the restrictions will affect recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton referred to the flat limit of £13,500 bringing in lower paid people whose bonus will take them over that level. That was a fair argument. The Bill refers to an annual rate of remuneration, and that will not include one-off payments such as bonuses unless they are so regular that they become part of the rate for the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises an important principle. It is not too long ago that local authorities had to introduce incentive schemes as a means of remunerating employees. Now that services are being contracted out, bonuses will be part of a worker's remuneration. Bearing in mind that bonuses will fluctuate and that provision is made for them in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
contracts, is the Minister saying that those bonuses will be disregarded in taking the figure of £13,500 into consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the definition of the rate for the job. If the hon. Member for Normanton reads clause 2(1)(h) he will see that it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the following provisions of this section under section 3 below, any person not falling within paragraphs (a) to (g) above whose annual rate of remuneration in respect of a post with the authority".</p></blockquote>
My interpretation of that, disregading one-off bonuses, is that if the annual rate of remuneration, with all things considered, exceeds £13,500 a person will be caught by the net. If my interpretation is wrong, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and also inform the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's offer but may we have a legal interpretation from the legal officers in the Department for the Environment? As the Minister knows, this measure will have to stand up in law. If the Minister can return to the Committee and say that his interpretation will be used by the law, that will cover our point. However, if the interpretation is not clear, will the Minister give the Committee an undertaking to amend the Bill to cover the point that we are making?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is not clear, I undertake to make it clear. This is a legal point, so perhaps its interpretation should be legal. I shall examine the question carefully and tell the Committee the precise definition of the annual rate of remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, but I shall attempt to explain what would be allowed. My interpretation is that, if the total amount paid in one year, including all eventualities and regular bonuses, exceeded that level, the officer would not escape the net, but we will get clarification.

Not for the first time, the Hon. Member for Normanton attacked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. He said that my right hon. Friend is engineering the demise of local government. I have never heard such nonsense. My right hon. Friend is trying to make local government more efficient and accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee, whose report I have referred to several times, was an independent body, and I challenge Opposition Members to find fault with the selection of its members. Later, we may find that Opposition Members welcome some of the committee's recommendations. Independently, the Widdicombe committee made certain recommendations which we have accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the members of the Widdicombe committee were not anti-local government or over critical of it. Like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, they were merely trying to make it more efficient and accountable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Widdicombe recommended that the cut-off point be at principal office and above, but instead the Government chose a salary limit of £13,500. The Widdicombe report specified principal

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
officer because it applied to managerial grades. By using a salary limit of £13,500 the Government are drawing into the net manual grades which Widdicombe did not envisage including. Why have the Government changed the cut-off point from principal officer, as recommended in the Widdicombe report, to a salary limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know what the Widdicombe comittee intended? Where does the report say that the committee did not intend to include senior manual workers? The report makes no such reference, only recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read the recommendation to the hon. Gentleman. I had to read it before our Committee sitting. I am sure that he accepts that the majority of Conservative Members do their homework. On page 113, the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore recommend that</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) employees of local authorities should continue to be able to become councillors in other authorities, provided that they are not employed at the rank of principal officer or above".</p></blockquote>
There is no reference in the preceding two pages to managerial position as such, and I challenge the hon. Gentleman to find one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Principal officer is a specific grade within local government, called PO 1 to PO 10 or PO 15. There is a senior officer grade in local government—SO 1 and SO 2. The report cited principal officer because it was referring specifically to managerial grades in local government, not to manual grades. A principal officer in a manual setup is not a manual grade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the past 10 minutes, we have discussed the differences in the grading system. In my answer to the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East I explained, perhaps not to his satisfaction, why we decided to fix a salary level. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) missed my explanation because he was not here, which is not my fault. This is the second time this morning that he has been late and then complained about a matter that was dealt with in his absence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hear what the Minister says, but surely his argument in reply to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) was that it was hard to make definition other than in terms of salaries and that he was worried about using grading. That is a wholly different argument from whether the rule extends to managerial staff. Opposition Members will find it hard to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put my reply in that way because I suggested that if the Bill contained regional and district council variations—which the hon. and learned Gentleman accepts—it would become incredibly complex. The legislation would become so unwieldy and untenable that the individual appointed by the Secretary of State to arbitrate would have an impossible job. That was the only reason
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
why I said that for uniformity and, I admit, for simplicity, we decided to use a figure rather than a grade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses say that the Widdicombe committee recommended that the restrictions should apply to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"staff in the grade of principal officer or above."</p></blockquote>
The Government have changed the word "grade" to "remuneration", although the notes on clauses specify that the Widdicombe report refers to "grade".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restricted posts can now depend on whether regular bonuses, overtime premiums and payment for weekend work or for other responsibilities are received. The Minister has moved away from the Widdicombe recommendation of grade structure and used remuneration. How does he reconcile the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simplest answer is one that I have not given so far. There is no uniform, national pay grade across local government. Amendment No. 31 could lead to complex regional variations of threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked whether it is right that an officer could not support members of his family in their political activities. That has always been the rule for civil servants, and it has caused no difficulties. I was genuinely interested by his suggestion of what would happen if a political poster was put up in the window of a house where a local government officer lived. The rules that we propose correspond to those for civil servants. They have worked for civil servants for generations, and problems have not arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restrictions apply to officers, not to members of their households. A political poster in a window is an officer's responsibility only if he or she puts it there, and if it can be shown that he or she did so. [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That explanation was entirely consistent with others that have come from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I listened to the Minister, I was persuaded that the lines that the amendment seeks to delete represent such an arbitrary decision that the Committee should be unwilling for them to remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 4, line 4, after "giving", insert "policy".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 36, in page 4, line 4, after "advice", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a chief officer, or acting on behalf of a chief officer in circumstances in which the postholder is the officer mainly responsible for such advice, and the advice is given".</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and for the purposes of this paragraph, 'regular basis' shall mean that the postholder is ordinarily responsible for advising the body concerned on a matter contained within its functions or terms of reference, as appropriate."</p></blockquote>
No. 39, in page 4, leave out lines 9 to 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 40, in page 4, line 11, after second "the", insert "policy".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 41, in page 4, line 13, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"as opposed to influencing decisions on individual cases in the exercise of professional judgment within policy guidelines laid down by the authority, any committee or sub-committee of the authority or any joint committee on which the authority are represented or a superior officer."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially the amendments revolve around subsection (3)(a) which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving advice on a regular basis to the authority themselves, to any committee or sub-committee of the authority or to any joint committee on which the authority are represented".</p></blockquote>
I should say that it all hinges on what is meant by "policy". Before the reorganisation of local government in 1972, it was often said that policy was made by councillors and implemented by officers. But upon that reorganisation, largely as a result of the Redcliffe-Maud commission report and also because of the Baines report, it was rightly considered that policy should be a matter both for the officers and the councillors. Together they would discuss, at the highest level in a local authority, major policy decisions and what course a local authority was likely to follow. One problem with the clause is that it is so wide in its determination of the term "advice". That is because that term is not coupled with "policy". Unless we are careful, some local government officers will be covered by the subsection when they should not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the making of a local authority budget. The chief officers and, when they stand in for them, the deputy chief officers will give major policy advice to the local council. Throughout the budget-making process, officers from each council department—sometimes even relatively low-level officers—will talk to various sub-committees and working parties and give advice to members of the council. Unless "policy" is included in the subsection to identify the "advice", many thousands of local authority officers who only occasionally give advice—or, more so, give advice which is by no means policy advice—will be caught by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite two examples from my local authority. The first is the safety officer of the county council, Michael Gough, who is also chairman of the finance committee of my local borough council. When he advises the county council, his advice is largely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
technical. Surely he could not be regarded as someone who gives regular policy advice to members of the local authority. Similarly, and more dramatically, is the example of a member of the borough council who is the improvement grants officer. Generally speaking, although this might change when we come to later parts of the measure, he would give non-controversial and non-policy advice. That officer who is called Dorian Jones—an appropriate name for someone in a Welsh authority—is also a member of a local community or parish council in a political capacity. But surely a safety officer for the county and an improvement grants officer for the district ought not to be included in the category of those who give advice to the authority. The advice referred to in the Bill should be major advice that is given by chief officers and deputy chief officers to the authority itself, a committee or a sub-committee. The Bill would be improved if "policy advice" were included rather than simply "advice". It would also mean far fewer exemptions. The provision would be tighter, tidier, and better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am sure that the Committee appreciates the careful way in which the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) spoke to the amendments. I understand his argument, which he expressed sensibly and reasonably. However, "policy" is not a helpful addition to the provision. It is a difficult word to define. I can imagine many issues on which it would be extremely difficult to decide whether the advice given was policy advice. Who would make that judgment? Indeed, although this was probably not the hon. Gentleman's intention, if "policy" were included it would mean that any authority which did not like the Bill's provisions could simply say that all its advice from officials was non-policy advice. It could be argued, "In this council, we make the policy. Any advice given is merely technical." But what is technical advice? It would be difficult to make such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen cited the example of the improvements officer. I am sure that that officer is a man of considerable probity, and I should not wish to use his case as an example. I do not know him and should not like to do so. Therefore, I shall pretend that we are talking about another council—perhaps in north Wales, to keep the subject within the Principality. Let us imagine that the improvements officer is someone who expresses extremely strong views elsewhere on private ownership. Surely it is likely to be thought by those in the council who receive his advice that such advice at least carries some of the taint and tinge of his views expressed in a neighbouring authority. That would be entirely possible. It would be jolly difficult to decide that his advice was not related to policy; it would be difficult to decide when it ceased to be technical advice, such as, "This is the house we are talking about; this is the improvement to which we refer", and said, "This is not the kind of improvement that we think is suitable, nor the kind of property, or possibly the kind of person, to whom we wish to make an improvement grant."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand what is meant by "policy". Technical advice may be considered by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
those who receive the advice as being very close to policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's argument. Ordinary officers who are fairly low down the scale advise the public—they are the face of the local authority. They also advise the council on individual matters that directly affect ordinary people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the rarefied concept of policy being general, high-flown advice. Mrs. Jones is interested in advice about her council house and in what advice about her house is given to the council—such as whether it is well maintained. The distinction is not as clear as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made comparisons with the Civil Service. There is a major difference between the policy advice that is given to him by senior civil servants and the advice that is given to people who visit a DSS office. There is a difference in the nature of that advice and in the regularity with which it is given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but in relation to the Civil Service, the core, nodal point is to whom the advice is given rather than its nature. When discussing politically restricted posts in the Civil Service, one of the most important questions concerns to whom civil servants give advice. We suggest under the Bill that the same tests are applied—to whom is the advice given, and is it given regularly. Occasionally, people ask advice from the humblest local authority employees. Some of the best advice that I have received about how a road might be mended was given by the chap who actually mended it. His advice was better than that given by those who oversaw his overseers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that, if a person was asked for advice and gave it, he would be excluded from political activity. People will be excluded only if they give advice on a regular basis. The words are included to give the right tone. The hon. Member for Torfaen referred to that, but it is difficult to amend legislation in the way that he suggested without undermining the efficacy of the Bill and changing our view on what it is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable for each side of the Committee to hold different views on what the Bill is about. We want to restrict those who give advice to a council on a regular basis from taking part in party politics. The amendment would change that provision irrevocably, and the Committee should reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both Ministers prayed in aid of the Civil Service procedure. Both said, "Well, that's all right. We'll do it that way." The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment gave the ludicrous example of a debate about whether a person could stick a political poster in his window. I did not think that British democracy would reach the stage where there would have to be a debate about whether that could be done. On one level, it is ludicrous, on another it has the fear of a Kafkaesque trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
Ministers keep praying in aid the Civil Service procedures. Why, then, do they not bring in the Civil Service procedure for appeals? That procedure includes a representative of the trade union or similar body. Why cannot the civil rights of local government officers be similarly protected? I would like the Minister to answer those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Gentleman in his use of the word "Kafkaesque". My reading of Kafka is not close enough to be sure exactly what he means. The discussion is not unreasonable because hon. Gentlemen raised the matter. It would be silly not to have such a discussion. I repeat my earlier example. My father and I had a serious discussion about whether, if he were to continue to be independent in the parish which he served, it was proper for his son to have a political poster in the window and whether he should ask me not to put it there. In the end, I chose to put the poster in a window which was clearly mine and not his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not only about window posters but about the appeals procedure. Both Ministers likened the provisions to the Civil Service procedure, but it has an appeal mechanism which includes a trade union representative—I have to keep talking to enable the Minister to get advice. If the Minister is using the Civil Service as his example, why cannot local authorities have the same civil rights safeguard—a representative of their side on the panel to which they appeal? The Minister, by leaving out the appeal system, is taking away the rights of local authorities. The Minister should not compare that with the Civil Service, where civil rights are protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want civil rights for ordinary members of the public who live in council houses. They want to know that they are getting independent advice. I want civil rights for people who want independent advice on education. This Bill is a major enhancement of the civil rights of most people in Britain. Many people have said voluntarily that their opportunities for taking part in politics should be restricted because they want to be independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of appeals, I was having a word with my officials because I wanted to know where the amendment that the hon. Member for Hammersmith was likely to table would appear, but it is not here. I am affeared of your wrath, Mr. Hunt, so I shall not pursue that matter, but I shall give the hon. Gentleman a foretaste of what I shall say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system in the Bill is much better in these circumstances than the system which applies to civil servants because we are dealing with a novelty. Until now, people have not needed a law—they have accepted what should be done. Britain operated more effectively when people imposed decent behaviour on themselves. It is said that we must now introduce regulations. People should be able to ask for advice from an independent person who is clearly outside politics. It is not a question of one side against the other or of conciliation between two sides. It is a question merely of asking an independent person, "Do you think that the two things are compatible

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
within the framework that is laid down?" That is what I shall say at the appropriate stage. I shall not say it now because if I do I shall be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 4, leave out lines 7 and 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee long, but I am confused about the intention of paragraph (b). My impression is that press and public relations people in local government are not more than a conduit between the local authority and the local press in most cases and, in exceptional cases, the national press and broadcasting organisations. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will explain the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we explained in the White Paper, there are certain sensitive posts in a local authority where the political impartiality of officers is especially important, and officers who deal regularly with the press and media are such an example. They prepare press releases and speak on behalf of the authority to the media and press and, like other local authority staff, they are appointed to serve the council as a whole. The Widdicombe committee made it clear that all officers, from chief executive to the lowest grade, are there to serve the council as a whole, and it is important that when they make public utterances on behalf of the authority, they should be, and should be seen to be, politically impartial. Councillors, the public and the press should all be confident that the views expressed are those of the council and not the personal political views of the officer who represents it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a point of fundamental division between the Opposition and the Government. It is perfectly possible for a person to hold one set of political views which they express by being involved in local government in one area, and to act as the council's spokesman in putting forward its view to the press and broadcasting organisations, whether locally or nationally. I can think of no examples to justify the provision, although perhaps the Minister can give us some. In effect, it is a purely professional function. In most cases, the officers in question express the council's view, and I am sure that they would do the same if the minority party—of whichever political persuasion—asked them for advice about putting its view on record. It is a purely technical job, in the sense that the people who do it pass on information to the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) a recent example? He may not be familiar with the press releases that are put out on behalf of the Derbyshire county council by councillor David Bookbinder, which are the subject of considerable local criticism because they appear to be extremely party political, instead of expressing the view of the whole council. That, of course, is a matter for Councillor Bookbinder, but if the press officer issuing the press releases was also a Labour councillor in a neighbouring authority, does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
the hon. Gentleman agree that the press and the public would have less confidence in councillor Bookbinder's press releases than they would if he was clearly an independent person? I happen to dislike his press releases, but I believe that he is better served if the person issuing the press releases is unbiased than if that person is biased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So this is a defence for such a council. A council can be sure that the representatives who speak for it are clearly independent, and that any criticism is directed where it should be directed—at the party-political staff who produced the press release. So the provision is rather helpful to the hon. Member for Knowsley, North, as well as being a rather loved one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of departure between the Minister and I is this: I am sure that the people of Derbyshire are not in the least concerned about who issues Councillor Bookbinder's press releases; they are concerned about their content and the reaction to it. The Minister keeps saying that the Government are worried about the people out there. I have had no mail—from people in Derbyshire or anywhere else—expressing concern about who puts out press releases. The difficulty is that the Government look for all the exceptions and abuses, or what they see as abuses, and then formulate legislation on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more typical example is councillor Keight, the leader of Knowsley council, whose stock response to any press inquiry is, "I have no comment to make." That is what happens up and down the country in local government. This legislation tries to find out what Councillor Bookbinder and his press officers do, without giving any thought to the generality, of which a more likely representative is Councillor Keight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what the hon. Gentleman says about Councillor Keight, but may I give him another fairly recent example? I recently invited Camden borough council to see me about the enormous right to buy delays in that borough. The meeting was attended not only by the Labour leader of the council but by some officers including, I understand, the press officer. As a result of that meeting, a press release was issued by Camden borough council, and it would stretch credulity to breaking point to say that it was a true reflection of the meeting that I chaired in the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did I receive mail as a result of that meeting? Yes, I did. Certainly, I received a stiff letter from the leader of the Conservative group on the council. Had he believed the press release, he would have thought it a very unusual meeting for a Minister to conduct and would have wondered why he had bothered to hold a meeting with the leader of Camden borough council. I decided to release my own press release from the Department of the Environment—a very uncharacteristic action—simply to put the mater right. I wrote a staff letter to the leader of the borough council and sent a copy to the local and national press, which received some coverage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and I want to stress is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
the system is open to abuse. The officer, however junior he may have been, released a wholly party-political spiel on behalf of Camden borough council, and it was not a true reflection of the proceedings of that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, I regret having given way to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and I detect no flash of light on the road to Damascus among Labour Members. I have enough respect for the Minister to say that he is a big boy now, living in a tough world, in the rough trade of politics, and he can deal with problems as they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister can do that. He and I were supposed to have a debate on radio. I went along on my own, but when I got there I found him with four staff, one of whom was his press officer. It was supposed to be a debate on the misleading information that his Department was issuing. If he needs a press officer and two or three other people to back him up, who pays for that—the
