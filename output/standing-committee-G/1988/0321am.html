<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 166 in page 33, line 45, leave out subsection (4) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) No statutory instrument containing an order under subsection (3) above shall be made unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 167, in Clause 140, page 118, line 11, after "under", insert "section 26(3)".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday, we had an interesting debate in which the Minister pledged his commitment to the economic development powers of local government and to partnership between the private and public sectors. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Bless you! I say that because I remarked earlier that only colds, 'flu and chest infections were passed in the Committee. I have had three colds since I have been on the Committee, which is a record.<br><br>
On 21 December 1988, the Secretary of State said that local authorities would have the power to undertake economic development activity in their area, as outlined in clause 25. That power is circumscribed by clause 26. In some instances, the Secretary of State and Ministers are given powers to remove the ability to act under clause 25, and to poll cap authorities on grounds of economic development activity, under this Bill and in their words, "any other enactment". We are anxious about those restrictions and Ministers' powers to fix financial limits which clause 25 seeks to remove.<br><br>
At our previous sitting, we debated the proposal of financial limits but specific powers for economic development. We must now debate the fact that having given those powers, the Minister can intervene and circumscribe them as he chooses. About 140 regulations arise out of the Bill and we are extremely anxious that the power that is being given is open ended.<br><br>
The Minister does not have to use the affirmative resolution procedure. All that we could do is pray against his actions. As my hon. Friend the Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said last week, the provisions decribed are to provide incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional powers. That is beyond what, in the past, would have been described as subsidiary and consequential legislation arising from a parent Act.<br><br>
We seek information about the use of the Minister's powers under clause 26. The Minister said that he cannot identify circumstances in which he would use them, but in what circumstances does he envisage using them? If he cannot tell us, the power should be dropped. He already has draconian powers in other legislation, for example, in respect of the poll tax and to cap authorities' general expenditure. Powers have been taken on capital, and other powers will be taken during the passage of the Bill. The Minister does not need the power to intervene from the centre and to meddle in the expenditure levels of local authorities.<br><br>
Any such power should be circumscribed by the affirmative resolution procedure of the House. The use of regulation is becoming a flood tide. It allows Ministers to do virtually anything they like under parent legislation. That is extremely dangerous. It gives blanket powers which, in the hands of any Minister or Government, are regrettable and reduce Parliament's ability to scrutinise, amend and do its duty properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said about the Minister's and the Secretary of State's use of regulations. I understand that, for domestic reasons, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is not with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not know that my hon. Friend is in hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>; I was aware of that. I simply wished to put the fact on record.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Wales has told Welsh local authorities that he does not intend to use the powers which are likely to be granted to him by the Bill. When the Minister of State winds up, perhaps he will comment on that.<br><br>
We all hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) will improve in health. Perhaps my message will be given to him when he returns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have tried to give maximum encouragement to local authorities to do what they consider right for their own communities. The rules are much more generous than those which have operated hitherto. Previously, there was a ceiling and some pretty curious arrangements for dealing with economic development.<br><br>
We are trying to do two things. First, we want clearly to show that economic development powers should be part of a local authority's armoury and, secondly, that the Government support local authorities that use those powers within restrictions which will be as little onerous as they need be.<br><br>
Our main concern is to ensure that the less advantaged parts of the country are not further
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
undermined by misuse of the powers by some of the richer parts of the country. That is the only major respect in which restrictions are felt to be necessary. There is no longer any upper limit on what the local authority can spend, and this is the only place where the Secretary of State retains an ability to control what could be a significant sum of money.<br><br>
Our intention is that, if there is good reason to intervene, the Secretary of State should be able to do so. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) rightly pushed me to say when that would be, and I said that I did not envisage that we would want to intervene on anything that is happening at present. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees, and if he were in my place I am sure that he would insist, that any sensible Government working within the British system, under which local authorities derive their powers from Parliament rather than the other way round, as in some other countries, ought to have that residual power.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) asked about the Secretary of State. I am unable to quote what he said, but I can say that the powers are not granted to him. They are ones which he, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment wanted.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Wales is no doubt saying what I would say, I know that all concerned will say that the power is not likely to be used extensively, freely or, perhaps, at all, but Governments must be able to step in if, for example, one or several local authorities use the power in a way which is deleterious to others.<br><br>
I was trying to think of a precise example for the hon. Member for Brightside. I can imagine that a local authority might act in an extreme way, use a lot of money, and thus distort its neighbour's opportunity to make reasonable economic developments.<br><br>
Somebody has to have the residual power, and it seems reasonable that the Secretary of State should have it. There are other powers under other legislation which enable local authorities to spend money in much the same area, so it is not unreasonable for the clause to cover them as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, when trying to conjure up an example, the Minister might cast his mind to enterprise zones. A local authority that has been granted an enterprise zone that has a deleterious effect on a neighbouring and just as hard-pressed authority might decide to improve its position by heavy expenditure on promotion to the point where the distortion reaches crisis point for the economy of the surrounding area. Given the research on enterprise zones, which shows their deleterious effect on the surrounding areas of the local authority concerned and on neighbouring authorities, the Minister might feel that it would be suitable to use the power to prevent enterprise zones from doing anything more to distort the pattern of economic development and employment prospects in surrounding areas.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to be tempted down the enterprise zone avenue, but I have a lot of time for enterprise zones. I believe that, with a number of other imaginative ideas, they have done much to improve circumstances in many areas. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to make a more general comment on the matter so as to stay well within the rules of order and not to make this a party-political argument. I can imagine circumstances in which one or several local authorities use the powers provided by the Bill in a way that undermines the perfectly reasonable activities of its neighbours.<br><br>
At some point somebody had to hold the ring. The only person who can do that is the Secretary of State responsible for local government, which is the reason for giving him this power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that that was one of the defects of the metropolitan council system? When Sheffield city council was working with South Yorkshire county council, for example, South Yorkshire did its own thing and Sheffield had to follow. Does my right hon. Friend agree that if the chairmen of the planning and employment committees were on the urban district council some of the fears of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) would be allayed?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I have understood my hon. Friend. Mechanisms to help are available, and that is one of them, but having refused to be led down that path by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) it would be impolite for me to be led down it by a friendly hand.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has highlighted circumstances in which such a power might have to be used. A local authority may undermine the policy of a neighbouring authority by using its wide powers in a counter-productive way. It may do something that another authority may be charged to do, in a way that is deleterious to the general thrust of that authority's policies. Once again, someone must hold the ring.<br><br>
This is not an unreasonable power; indeed, it would be unreasonable not to have it. Many of my hon. Friends and, I believe, one or two Opposition Members—were our roles reversed, it would be every Opposition Member—believe that it would be wrong not to have such a reserve power. That is the inevitable concomitant of having a degree of freedom on economic development, which I welcome. I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendments but will leave the freedom with this clear residual power attached.<br><br>
The Committee should remember that, under the present powers and the existing limits, only 20 authorities are using more than 80 per cent. of the money that they could. We are talking about an extremely unlikely turn of events because, with the exception of a tiny group of authorities, the present headroom which is based upon provisions that have not changed since 1972 has proved plenty good enough for authorities until now. The Committee should have no real fear in this regard.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall press the amendment to a vote. The Minister has used the same argument that was used on rate capping. When 20 authorities were rate capped in 1985, the argument was that they were few in number and that it therefore did not matter. We believe that even if only one authority were involved, its ability to decide its own priorities and to raise and spend money as it felt fit would remain an important democratic right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that the Meadowhall development in Sheffield was adjacent to the boundary of Rotherham produced a conflict of interests between the two district authorities? In such cases, where authorities are unable to resolve their problems, the Secretary of State's intervention would assist one authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good example, which clearly shows that there is no need for intervention. Although Rotherham had been "given" an enterprise zone, and although the Government smile on authorities such as Rotherham, the Meadowhall development came to Sheffield. Notwithstanding the criticisms of high rates, and all that was wrongly said in Intercity Network magazine, which I read following the comments of the Under-Secretary of State last Thursday, and which I shall take up with British Rail, the proof of the pudding was in the eating—the Meadowhall development is to be built in Brightside in Sheffield. Authorities should be allowed to decide what is good for them and sort matters out for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued that the money was not being taken up. Perhaps I may draw my hon. Friend's attention to a report in the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> last Thursday. The Minister with responsibility for inner cities was in Bradford last week. When asked why the city had been targeted for several Government grants in recent months, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our attitude has changed since Tories took control.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This is because we believe the council will promote economic development which you would never see from a local authority controlled by Socialists."</p></blockquote>
Do we take it that one reason why the money has not been taken up is that it is being wrongly targeted, and that authorities that would take it up are not being allowed to do so, resulting in a surplus? Is the Minister using that as a reason for not accepting the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that the Government are understandably distorting the extent to which they reward the ideological values and practices with which they agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Members of Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that I stand by every word that I said to the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> reporters. It is not the ideological difference that concerns us as regards the issue that was brought to the attention of that newspaper. What matters is that the Labour-controlled authority at the time submitted a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
programme that complied with the criteria of the Department of the Environment. The vast majority of Labour-controlled local authorities spend up to their allocation but, because of the crass inefficiency, Bradford city council—then controlled by the Socialists—underspent. That is why I criticised it. That will not happen again because the Conservatives are now in control of Bradford.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting juxtaposition of ideas. If an authority overspends, it gets capped; if it underspends, the money is taken away. In other words, whichever way the coin falls, the Government win.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by that last comment. If an authority spends other people's money—money that it has no right to spend—it should be stopped. By the same token, it is wrong to continue to pour money into an authority to help it to meet its needs if it is so inefficient that it cannot spend it. That seems a good recipe for running a properly organised business community or even country. It is precisely because the Opposition do not understand the difference between those concepts that no sensible electorate would vote for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No sensible electorate would vote for a Government who had £14 billion sloshing about and, wrote it off in the repayment of a historic debt instead of using it to improve the country's infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>; Would the hon. Gentleman say that he had £100,000 sloshing about in his bank account if, at the same time, he owed £1 million. I suggest that he would put the £100,000 towards the £1 million debt and leave himself owing only £900,000. He would not then appear to be flush.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To use the Prime Minister's analogy, a sensible family who accrued enough money to go on holiday would not decide to write off part of their mortgage instead. They would carry on paying the debt in the normal fashion, which is what the country, local authorities and sensible people do. Or does the Tory party propose that people should not save or invest in building societies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Budget debate concluded last night.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand reprimanded, Mr. Hunt. I am happy to return to the Minister's remarks about Bradford.<br><br>
We all want local authorities to spend the capital or revenue moneys earmarked by them or by the Government. It helps when the Department of the environment approves programmes well in advance of the year in which expenditure on them is needed, enabling local authorities to plan sensibly and so to spend the money, but approvals sometimes come several months after the beginning of the financial year, making it virtually impossible for authorities to do their job effectively.<br><br>
Ultimately, those considerations are irrelevant to whether authorities can make their own decisions
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
and whether their electorates can judge them and hold them to account for what they do rather than for what the Secretary of State does. People will have to decide whether they hold the Secretary of State or their local politicians to account, and we must decide whether we believe in local democracy.</span></p>

GUIDANCE AND CONSULTATION ABOUT PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 226, in page 34, line 12, leave out from "authority" to end of line 14 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"to determine whether they will take any steps for the promotion of the economic development of their area.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 227, in page 34, line 18, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"before the beginning of that year.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>; I apologise for my voice, Mr. Hunt. I hope that it sounds clear to you. It does not sound clear to me; it is echoing round my head as I have a cold. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has passed it on to me, but I do not recommend it.<br><br>
The amendment would remove the stipulation that economic development can be decided on by a local authority only one year in advance. I welcome and support the consultation element in the clause, but the demand that a local authority shall establish whether it will take any steps in the following financial year is inflexible. In any financial year 31 March is an arbitrary date by which a local authority should decide whether to invest in economic development. Unfortunately, in the real world, that date will not necessarily be appropriate for an authority's needs.<br><br>
The aim of the amendments is to ensure that local authorities can act quickly in response to local needs. I shall give two examples. First, if modest expenditure by a local authority could save many jobs at a local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
business which was in trouble, but that business encountered difficulties in April, the local authority would have to wait a full year before it could offer financial help.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The second example concerns a business which is thinking about moving into an area, promising many additional jobs which will benefit the community. Will the subsection mean that the firm has to wait a whole year before the local authority can offer it financial encouragement to move into the area? Often, of course, it will be possible to react, but there are bound to be circumstances in which the restriction in the Bill would prevent that. A local authority must have the flexibility to act quickly—certainly more quickly than suggested. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept the intention of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) has made a quite weak case, and he should look carefully at the amendment to see what it would remove. There would be none of the consultation with the private sector that he seems to favour, about which, I think, there is no quarrel between us. It would virtually be policy on the hoof; going through the financial year discussing what was needed by way of economic development at the time when the need arose. Some flexibility is already built into the system which would allow for contingencies throughout the programme.<br><br>
A parallel can be drawn with the urban programme, which I accept is available in only 57 local authorities, where a programme would be agreed in outline by the Department of the Environment. In the case of local authorities under clause 27, there could be consultation with the chamber of commerce, the chamber of trade and other local enterprise agencies—all of which I know that the hon. Member for Truro would support. That is enshrined in the Bill, in that it accepts that local authorities should not assume that they know what is best for economic development. Again, I think, there is no quarrel between us.<br><br>
Consultation should take place before the beginning of the financial year so that a proper programme, properly administered, can be carried out, notwithstanding the fact that an emergency may arise three, six or nine months into the financial year, and I doubt if there would be much quarrel about it as long as the criteria on economic development laid down by the Department of the Environment were fulfilled.<br><br>
By removing the words
<br><blockquote><p>"before the beginning of that year"</p></blockquote>
we would produce the opposite effect of what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) thought was a good idea: that the programme should be put up before the beginning of the year so that everyone knew where they stood. Apart from that, as the programme would no doubt be published or, at the least, discussed in the local press, I imagine that the private sector would like to know how successful its approaches to the local authority have

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
been. Again, I think there is little difference between the hon. Member for Truro and I on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister expect the flexibility that he favours to work? If Toyota is looking for a site in an area, the authority may wish to respond with action that involves expenditure outside that agreed at the beginning of the financial year if Toyota shows interest in April. Similarly, if a factory such as Birds eye suddenly runs into a crisis in April its local authority might wish to try to sort out the problem before the start of the financial year. I think that the Minister is saying that local authorities could respond in those circumstances, but I cannot see how the Bill allows them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They could, provided that the support that they made available complied with the Department of the Environment's overall guidelines on economic development.<br><br>
In the example of Toyota, I understand that even if a measure proposed in response by a local authority complied with the Department's guidelines, it could wipe out the economic development programme for the whole year. The decision would be for the authority to make at the time. It would be up to the council to explain to its electorate why it scotched its economic development programme for the year.<br><br>
The amendment would lead to incredible confusion. For simplicity, good administration and good housekeeping it is better to agree an economic development programme at the start of the year. I do not accept that the Bill will lead to a mass of bureaucracy which will be a brake on the enterprise that a local authority seeks to encourage. For good order, so that we all know where we stand, a programme should be agreed. If an authority has been responsible by listening to the overtures from private sector organisations, a number of which I have catalogued, it will wish its electorate to know what is happening.<br><br>
The programme is flexible. To go down the route advocated by the hon. Member for Truro would be disastrous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be saying that a local authority must draw up its plans at the beginning of the financial year as outlined in the Bill, but that it need not stick to its plans providing that they are within the general guidelines issued by the Secretary of State. It is a little odd that the Minister will not accept the amendments. It appears that although authorities have to draw up programmes they do not have to stick to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is pretty obvious to the vast majority of members of the Committee why I am not prepared to accept the amendment in its present form. Under the amendment, no local authority would put a programme together or consult with the private sector and with those who, I think the hon. Gentleman would agree, know best or at least better than local or even central Government.<br><br>
My guess is that if we implied in words writ large in the Bill, "You should do this, but you needn't
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
necessarily stick to it rigorously throughout the financial year," no local authority would stick to its programme. The hon. Gentleman's party supported the rate consultation procedure, which is enshrined in legislation, and there is a similar advantage in including this procedure in the Bill.<br><br>
There is flexibility in the provision. I hope that nobody reading the record of our debates gains the impression that local authority programmes do not matter, because half-way through the financial year they can take measures to scupper them. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor I want that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument was slightly odd, but nevertheless I am interested by it. Can an authority change its programme only with the approval of the Secretary of State, or need it only follow the general guidelines?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the Department of the Environment's criteria on what could constitute economic development. As long as any contingency plan which might arise during a financial year complied with the Department's guidelines, for which the Secretary of State is ultimately responsible, there would be no problem.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will understand my difficulty. I do not want to encourage local authorities not to comply with their programmes. I will look carefully to see whether there is a form of words which will make it clear that in exceptional circumstances there could be a change in the economic development programme agreed by a council.<br><br>
I do not wish to build up the hon. Gentleman's hopes. It is abundantly clear that, first and foremost, the local authority agrees its economic development programme, which is all that matters in this argument. If a council wishes to take steps to encourage Toyota to come to its borough, it is up to the council to explain why schemes that people in the local business community hold dear are to be scrapped. I do not want to give the impression that we are not serious about local authorities consulting with the private sector prior to set and agree economic development programmes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expected a number of possible reactions, but that was not one of them. In effect, the Minister agrees that flexibility is necessary but he does not want to tell anyone.<br><br>
I am anxious to look at the words that the Minister used on another occasion, and perhaps I can table a slightly differently-worded amendment to meet his objection. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 34, line 32, after the second "the", insert "estimated."</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"and is to be attributable to different proposals".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also have a very sore throat, not for the third time during Committee stage but the first time since I came here. I hope that you will forgive me if I occasionally take a sip of orange to clear my throat, Mr. Hunt, although my ailment might do me some good. I have to go on a 12-mile sponsored walk on Sunday and if my throat becomes worse it might get me out of that, so I am not bothered whether I have a cold.<br><br>
The Minister's response to amendment No. 226 was not very convincing or encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just bizarre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My amendment would allow an authority's economic development plan to set out estimated expenditure allowing flexible use of the economic development power and it would give authorities greater flexibility to deal with unforeseen opportunities requiring action under clause 25.<br><br>
The requirement under clause 27(4) for authorities to publish advanced detailed plans would seriously inhibit their ability to respond to major development proposals, such as interest from foreign investors in large-scale factory developments involving many jobs, which could not be foreseen in the forward planning process. For example, in the case of Sanyo at Newton Aycliffe, Durham county council and Sedgefield district council had to respond quickly with substantial financial incentives as part of a package arranged in collaboration with the Department of Trade and Industry.<br><br>
Clause 27 contains several separate but related constraints and influences on a local authority's power to incur expenditure for economic development purposes under clause 25.<br><br>
Subsection (2) requires the authority to determine in advance whether it will take steps in any year to promote economic development. If it so determines, subsections (3) and (4) require it, again in advance, to publish a document setting out details of its proposals, the likely expenditure to be incurred carrying them out, whether the expenditure is to be capital or revenue, a breakdown of expenditure between the various proposals, an estimate of any income likely to accrue from the proposals and what the authority intends their implementation to achieve.<br><br>
Subsection (3) requires the authority to consult industrial and commercial sectors about the proposals, but makes no provision for compliance with the published proposals or for what should happen if an authority wishes to change, retract or add to its proposals.<br><br>
It is necessary to bear in mind what the Government try to achieve by the controls in clause 27. In paragraph 7.7 of the White Paper in response to the Widdicombe report, the Government acknowledged that
<br><blockquote><p>"In many cases local authority economic initiatives have been an important element in the success of central government policies."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
In paragraph 7.8 of the White Paper they say:
<br><blockquote><p>"in some areas local authority schemes appear to be comparable in terms of cost effectiveness to similar schemes funded by central government."</p></blockquote>
11.15 am<br><br>
The Government's intended objectives for local authority involvement in economic development, as shown in the White Paper, are to "encourage efficient financial management" and:
<br><blockquote><p>"to rationalise the present legislative framework, and to remove the current anomalies between what different types of authority may do".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 7.16 gives the clearest indication of what the Government want to achieve by imposing controls on the general power to assist economic development. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"New procedural requirements will be introduced to encourage sensible economic development measures at the local level. The objectives will be to ensure proper consideration of priorities across the whole field of economic development; co-ordination with other activities by the authority and with other agencies in the public and private sectors; and proper scrutiny. Special provision will be made for consultation with the business community."</p></blockquote>
The main problem is the stringency of subsections 3(a) and 4 of clause 27 which, on a strict interpretation, could be taken to require the local authority to be project-specific when setting out its proposals for economic development for the next financial year.<br><br>
The danger of that approach is that clause 27(4)(a) is likely to be counter-productive; it will inhibit the effectiveness of local authorities carrying out economic development and co-operating with the private sector and Government to achieve initiatives such as those mentioned in paragraph 7.7 of the White Paper, which are described as:
<br><blockquote><p>"an important element in the success of central government policies."</p></blockquote>
Consultation with the business community is understood and accepted by local authorities. However, the drafters of clause 27 seem to have been affected by an attack of over-enthusiasm about the detail required as part of that process.<br><br>
I have a typical report from Durham county council's economic development sub-committee. The number of individual applications, the great diversity in scale and type of activities an the job implications of each one is immediately noticeable. I shall cite examples of requests made in October 1988 which came during, not at the beginning, of the financial year.<br><br>
The report mentions about 36 requests for financial aid, a package of approximately 600 new jobs and expenditure of about £222,000. Let us consider small business grants. A firm called Auckland Communications at Spennymoor, which deals with the sale and installation of telephone systems, applied for a grant of £1,000 and promised to create approximately six jobs. United Computer Solutions Ltd. in Durham which provides computer technical services requested a small business grant and planned 18 new jobs.<br><br>
Let us consider rates equivalents grant over one year. A firm called Industrial Rearing Systems Ltd.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
in Newton Aycliffe, which is involved in the manufacture and wholesale distribution of ball bearings, requested a grant of about £5,500, and promised 22 new jobs. Two bigger firms asked for rate equivalent grants over two years—Tarmac Construction Ltd., a plant hire business, promised 44 new jobs if it received a grant of nearly £14,000; a brand new business in Peterlee, North Salmon Smokery Ltd., promised about 50 new jobs if it received a grant of £27,000.<br><br>
The list goes on, naming small and big firms that offered a certain number of jobs on a condition of grant availability. But the requests arrived well after the beginning of the financial year.<br><br>
Durham county council provides about £1 million a year in financial incentives to industrialists. That is not an extravagant amount. Although the annual overall budget is known in advance, there is no way of predicting who will apply for assistance or whether the budget will be sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is so wrong about the consultation process in the clause and in detailing, in that forward programme, the sum total to be made available to those small firms? What is so wrong about that? Surely that meets the point completely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As drafted, the clause means that plans will have to be much more specific. We want the plan to be more flexible and non-specific so that business or industrial requests made after the beginning of the financial year can be taken into account.<br><br>
However, as I said, although the overall annual budget is known in advance, there is no way of predicting who will apply for the assistance or whether the budget will be sufficient. The programme is, and to a large extent must remain, demand led.<br><br>
There are frequent upheavals in a local economy, especially in an area such as Durham county. There must be flexibility in an authority's forward programme as substantial changes might be required in the middle of the financial year to respond to different needs of opportunities—for example, to respond to changes in areas eligible for either EEC or United Kingdom assistance.<br><br>
We all know some of the crises faced by Durham county council in the past 10 years. Major closures affected traditional heavy industries—for example, the closures at Consett steelworks, Shildon wagon works and East Durham colliery and cokeworks. At Consett, 8,000 jobs were lost virtually over night, 4,000 directly as a result of that closure and an estimated further 4,000 in the local economy. Significant and speedy Government action was taken to revive the economy; that was supported and supplemented by the county and district councils using their own resources. Similar public sector action was necessary at Shildon. Authorities must have sufficient flexibility to deal quickly with such crises in the local economy, which sometimes occur on a totally unforeseeable scale.<br><br>
Similarly, authorities must be able to shift priorities and re-order activities to take advantage
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
of unforeseeable opportunities for assisting in the regeneration of the local economy. That brings me back to the Sanyo project, which is a good example.<br><br>
In 1987, Sanyo decided to manufacture microwave ovens within the EEC. Several locations were considered, but the final choice rested between France and the United Kingdom. The project involves an investment of approximately £9.4 million and will eventually provide about 500 new jobs.<br><br>
In July 1987, representatives of Sanyo, the DTI and the local authorities visited a site in Durham county. One week later, Durham county council and Sedgefield district council were approached by the Northern Development Company with an urgent request to consider offering a substantial financial pakage of incentives, as the Department of Trade and Industry was unable to offer regional selective assistance for the microwave project. That meant that the company's first choice—the United Kingdom—was in jeopardy. To secure the project, both authorities found it necessary to reorganise their programmes, and a substantial package of incentives was produced. Sanyo formally announced in March 1988 that it would be locating in the Durham county council area. The investment and job opportunities that it would create would give a considerable boost to the local economy. However, the clause gives rise to strong reservations about whether it could happen because the allocation will not apply in the coming financial year. The examples make it plain that authorities are unable to predict the details required by clause 27(4)(a) about where and when a crisis will occur or when substantial diversions of resources will be necessary. It is genuinely not possible to produce for consultation purposes before the beginning of the new financial year a statement of the expenditure attributable to different proposals that is to be incurred.<br><br>
The amendment does not attack the principle of consultation or the requirement to divide likely expenditure between capital and revenue. It simply makes it clear that authorities would not need to attempt the impossible and be specific in advance about projects in a programme that must be largely demand led. They would merely be required to state the estimated total of clause 25 expenditure and the sort of incentives to be used. This is entirely reasonable and in line with the Government's intention in the White Paper. The best that can be done is what authorities currently do for budgetary purposes—produce an overall estimate of the revenue and capital expenditure likely to be incurred in the forthcoming financial year. At present, there is no sanction for non-compliance with, or departure from, published proposals. Bearing in mind the Secretary of State's detailed power in clause 26, to regulate the exercise of economic development powers, it concerns us greatly that an authority's flexibility to respond to fluctuating local economic conditions and unforeseen opportunities could be seriously eroded by the provision which, on the face of it, purports to relate only to advance publication of intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having heard that very long speech, I am wondering for how long the hon. Gentleman speaks when his throat works properly.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's comments, much of which were wide of the mark and did not relate specifically to the amendment, which is about estimated expenditure.<br><br>
I found the hon. Gentleman's examples fascinating. The Labour party's new-found love of small firms tickles me to death. As the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has risen to the bait, perhaps I should remind him and his hon. Friends that the phrase "small firms" was not in the Labour party manifestos of 1979, 1983 or 1987. Many Opposition Members would not understand the term "enterprise" if it jumped up and hit them in the face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is unbecoming of the Minister to make that facetious and uncalled-for remark. Records of estimated expenditure and annual rate estimates show that for almost the past 10 years Durham county council and Durham city council have included in their estimates help for small businesses through rate relief and grants. I do not think that the Minister need be so facetious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If Durham city council has been doing that, it has done right in terms of economic development.<br><br>
This is a topical issue which is relevant to the debate, as only yesterday evening, the Leader of the Opposition spoke about small firms. I hope that Durham has got it right, because the Leader of the Opposition has not.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is advocating that the Labour party should support the creation of small business agencies to act as one-stop shops for advice to small firms on matters such as tax and training, research, funding and planning. Where has the Leader of the Opposition been for the past 10 years? There has been a dramatic growth in local enterprise agency movements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where was the hon. Gentleman then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For four and a half years of that 10-year period I was Minister with responsibility for small firms. I promoted and encouraged local enterprise agencies. As the hon. Gentleman is so uninformed, perhaps he ought to be briefed by his hon. Friends, especially the hon. Member for City of Durham, who clearly has it right, as his county seems to have it right.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister drew parallels between the urban programme and the activities which the clause provides. I am unsure whether it is clear in his mind that grant and project—specific money will be paid or whether he thinks that a programme like the urban programme might be involved. One will require an estimate that must be adhered to throughout the year; the other will be project-specific and people will come individually to the Department for money. Is that no so? It is what the Bill states.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is giving the Committee the impression that he has read the Bill, but he cannot have done, because the word "project" is not in the clause. The clause refers to proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No doubt you, Mr. Hunt, will tell the Minister if he strays too far out of order. He is trying to avoid answering by indulging in a response that is not only irrelevant but wrong. His Government presided over the greatest ever collapse of small businesses, with receiverships and bankruptcies far more numerous than under any previous Government. The Government's policies had about the same effect on small companies as an application of Agent Orange would have on a garden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not come with a shovel to try to dig out his hon. Friends. I shall give him the facts. When he has them he can try to distort them if he wishes. The number of self-employed people in Britain is the highest that it has been for 60 years. The growth in small businesses—those employing fewer than 200 people, which is the United Kingdom definition—is the fastest in recorded history. I hope that the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) will not be so stupid as to argue with me about the figures, which I have cited so often, and which I have now brought up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is doing what the Government are so good at—twisting statistics. The Minister has started from a different base. Let us consider what has happened since the base year—1980—when there was devastation of small businesses. Naturally there has been rapid growth, as there has been in manufacturing industry, but there is still less activity than there was in 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have had a good exchange on that subject, which was completely out of order. We must get back to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for City of Durham could give the wrong signals. I will try to convince him. No one would suggest that the figures given by the private sector during consultations would have to be rigidly adhered to in every detail.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said earlier that I had drawn a comparison between this matter and the urban programme. I do not believe that there is a better parallel to be drawn, for the simple reason that the urban programme has to be put together in toto and there must be a certain amount of detail. The hon. Gentleman will know from his experience of the Leeds urban programme that if a change is proposed during the year it is usual for a local government officer from Leeds city council to approach a civil servant in the Yorkshire and Humberside regional office responsible for the urban programme to see whether the new proposal can replace our existing one. I do not say that he would be prepared to admit it publicly but he must be aware, as many Opposition Members would be prepared to accept, that we are flexible in that regard whenever we can, as I believe we should be.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be missing the point. Will there be a separate budget similar to the urban programme to support the provision, or will each project come to the Department independently and be tested on its own merits? In other words, will there be a programme in the Department?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, nor has anyone ever suggested that. The hon. Gentleman lives in a fantasy world. He dreams up these things, or probably has nightmares about them. We are talking about proposals, not projects. I understand, of course, that he loves the phrase "project specific". When I intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for City of Durham and said that Durham county council could surely earmark money in a budget for the small firms grants to which he referred, he seemed to brush that on one side. I believe that the majority of county councils or district councils operates in that way now. Obviously, I have no quarrel with that; I am merely trying to replicate their good example throughout the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
What is different about clause 27 I accept this entirely—is that there would have to be consultation before starting to carry out the programme at the beginning of the local government year. That would be a good thing, and I welcome the fact that it has not been the subject of an attack. It seems that that form of consultation will be widely supported.<br><br>
My concern relates to what I said in reply to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). If we are not careful and we dilute the language of the Bill, as I suggested we might if we inserted a word such as "estimated", local authorities, be they at county or district level, would adopt only a broad-brush approach, so that the proposal to consult the private sector would be a waste of time.<br><br>
That is my specific answer to the amendment. Some flexibility is built into the provision—I can give the hon. Member for City of Durham that reassurance—and I hope that in view of what I have said, he will withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister, but my hon. and learned Friends and I believe that the amendments would increase local authorities' flexibility in responding to changes in the local economic infrastructure. They could respond quickly and flexibly when economic development initiative was needed, it is in the best interests of local authorities and local communities to plan ahead, as the clause suggests, and to have the flexibility to cater for new situations as they arise. There are the 1,000 job losses at the Bird's Eye factory which the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) mentioned, for example, which could not be accounted for if there were a set plan and proposal.<br><br>
I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, but if on reading <i>Hansard</i> we feel that our questions have not been answered to our satisfaction, we shall return to the matter at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be briefer than the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) and more successful than I was during the previous sitting in keeping on your right side, Mr. Hunt, although I thought you were very generous to the chief Opposition spokesman in our debate, the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley).<br><br>
I should declare at the outset, that I am a consultant to the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment knows of my long association with that organisation before I became a Member of this House. Indeed, my period with the ABCC roughly coincided with the period that he was the Minister with responsibilities for small firms. I pay tribute to the great skill, care and success with which he carried out his brief.<br><br>
I am grateful to hear from the Minister that the clause is intended to have a degree of flexibility, but having heard from the Opposition, and bearing in mind the local authority point of view, it is right that we should hear from the Conservative side, the business point of view, on consultation.<br><br>
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce welcomes some of the measures in the clause, especially the provisions that local authorities must draw up an economic development programme in a specific document, that the expenditure should be attributed to specific proposals within the programme and that the authority should say what its proposals are intended to achieve.<br><br>
The ABCC has certain reservations, however, and I should like to test my hon. Friend the Minister and have answers from the Government in response to them. The ABCC feels that the clause is insufficient as a means of promoting meaningful consultation between local authorities and the business community. It feels, in particular, that it does not go as far as section 134 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. First, it fails first to specify who local authorities should consult. It fails especially to provide through guidance from the Secretary of State that local authorities should consult the representative bodies of non-domestic ratepayers. Secondly, the clause does not make consultation a requirement. It is discretionary, and there are references in the clause to
<br><blockquote><p>"as they consider appropriate"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"think it desirable to consult",</p></blockquote>
whereas consultation on local authority expenditure in section 134 of the Local Government Finance Act is a statutory duty.<br><br>
I appreciate the change made in the relationship between the local business community and local authorities by the introduction of the uniform business rate. Before we have any argument about that, I should say that I support the UBR and that the ABCC and I were pressing for it long before the Government proposed it. Even with the UBR and the business rating regime that will exist from next
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
year, consultation will remain important to the local business community. That is because the expenditure of local authorities is substantial, because it will remain even under the UBR, which is largely funded by business rating, and because the effects of such expenditure can have a significant impact on local economic performance for good or ill.<br><br>
Chambers of commerce are particularly interested in and affected by spending on local economic development where, on occasion, local authorities may substitute their own activity for private sector agencies or may otherwise distort the market for business intermediaries.<br><br>
As I think this has been mentioned already, consultation matters. That is because businesses are well equipped to judge the value, appropriateness and effectiveness of proposed economic development activity. Therefore, we wish there to be a healthy dialogue between business people, who know about business, and local authorities. I am not saying that they know it all or that they understand how local authorities work, but consultation on rates and local government spending in previous years has on the whole been fruitful.<br><br>
Indeed, I stress that there is a great variety of attitudes to the concept of consultation, as my hon. Friend the Minister has said. Some authorities, which tend to be Conservative—I do not want to labour the point and cross swords with the hon. Member for Hammersmith—pursue consultation vigorously and effectively. Others do not. The paradox is that when consultation is most necessary, because of the level of spending or of local authority sponsored or financed economic activity, the local authorities are the least willing to consult.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I would welcome the Under-Secretary's comments on what I have said. I shall not go into details, but he will be aware that the chambers of commerce have ambitious objectives. They want a duty to be laid on the authorities to consult and to secure the agreement of the business community to the programme of economic development activity. They propose ways in which the Secretary of State may withhold money if such agreement is not forthcoming. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to respond to my arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clauses 25, 26 and 27—the three economic development clauses—are classic examples of the Government giving something with one hand and rapidly grabbing it back with the other. Most authorities welcomed the undertaking in the White Paper that legislation would be introduced to give councils a specific power to carry out economic development. The White Paper mentioned a "general, but circumscribed power" to be utilized
<br><blockquote><p>"at the discretion of the authority".</p></blockquote>
To be fair, clause 25 is not a bad attempt to produce a reasonably workable economic development power. It is focused, as the Government intended, in the White Paper and would allow authorities a degree of discretion to respond to local circumstances as they saw fit, whether dealing with crises and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
upheavals caused by major factory closures or seizing opportunities to facilitate substantial inward investment projects.<br><br>
However, the Government could not leave the matter there. The power had to be circumscribed. Clause 25 has to be read with clause 26. Despite the new accountability that is supposed to be achieved by the introduction of the poll tax, the Government regard that new power as potentially so intoxicating in the hands of authorities that the Secretary of State must have the power in clause 26 to cut their general discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is relating his remarks to previous clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>; It is important that clause 27 is seen in the light of the two previous clauses and this part of the Bill, Mr. Hunt.<br><br>
Clause 27 does nothing to encourage sensible eonomic development. It produces more bureaucratic hoops for authorities to jump through before they can get on with the legitimate business of encouraging industry and employment in their areas. That, of course, assumes that they have any discretion left after the Secretary of State has imposed his restrictions and cash limits under clause 26.<br><br>
Subsections (1) and (2) place local authorities under a duty to do something that they would have to do in any event as part of the usual budgetary process for the forthcoming financial year, and that is to consider the likely use of their economic development powers. Subsections (3) and (4) are new elements. They are designed, presumably, to secure the wise counsels of the business community in a similar way to the Rates Act 1984, which requires consultation with local business interests in the process leading up to the setting of a rate.<br><br>
In Durham county, such consultation has taken place on authorities' budgets and has been welcomed. However, the local business community has not been falling over itself to make representations to the authorities. In the past, there has been little private sector involvement in Durham county in economic development generally, and most development has been as a result of public sector initiatives. Authorities generally welcome private sector interest, and the county council is trying to encourage the establishment of a county Durham chamber of trade or similar body.<br><br>
The Government have not produced a satisfactory reason why the power in question should be singled out as requiring a formal consultation process with the private sector, and the clause will do nothing to assist authorities in making the right sort of contact with the private sector.<br><br>
Promotion of economic development must be largely demand led within a general programme of incentives. It is difficult to understand how a requirement for formal consultation with local business communities can produce any valuable contribution to sharpening or targeting authorities' efforts. Authorities receive applications for financial assistance now in respect of a range of projects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
including starting small businesses, established firms wishing to expand and individuals seeking assistance for specialist commercial advice. There is constant contact already with members of the business community asking for help. Staff in economic development units spend much effort keeping in touch with local industry. A continuous working relationship is required. Authorities are constantly monitoring the effectiveness of their activities and various incentive and priorities are always being shifted so as to achieve the maximum impact with limited financial resources.<br><br>
Subsection (4) demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the real world in which local authorities work. It assumes a tidy administrative environment where all problems and opportunities can be foreseen and planned for in advance, down to the finest detail. Authorities will have little difficulty in describing what they intend to achieve by the implementation of their proposals as required by clause 27(4)(c), but to expect them to produce the detailed, itemised programme envisaged by subsection (4)(a) in a way that will have value for consultation purposes is utterly unrealistic.<br><br>
Clause 27 is pure surplusage. The statutory imposition of another layer of detailed administrative process in addition to the sweeping powers given to the Secretary of State under clause 26 will only hamper the flexibility of authorities in carrying out the vital work that they can do in their areas to complement the work of the private sector and Government agencies in encouraging economic development. Indeed, the Government have admitted the value of that work in the White Paper. If they were serious about effective economic development powers for local government, however, they would abandon clause 27. It will waste time, effort and resources which could be better used in getting on with the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will forgive me if I devote many of my remarks to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) whose contribution was less painful than that of the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Nicholson). I have never been reduced to tears in a Committee before, and I am not sure whether it was because of good humour or the painful things that he appeared to describe. I appreciate that he wanted to get things off his chest or perhaps other parts of his anatomy.<br><br>
I yield to no one in my admiration for the chamber of commerce movement, and especially the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. I pay tribute to the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton over many years in his capacity as consultant to that organisation. The ABCC is more respected and highly regarded than at any time in its history, and my hon. Friend has played a significant part in that achievement.<br><br>
There is no finer organisation than a chamber of commerce for local authorities to consult if they wish to take the advice of the business community. The same applies to the chamber of trade, which is merged with the chamber of commerce in many instances. My only disappointment during my tenure as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
Minister with responsibility for small firms and enterprise was that the chambers did not merge nationally. It is a source of regret to me and to many others including, perhaps, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend knows, although the chamber of commerce movement has spread far and wide it does not cover every local authority. It does not cover my constituency because there is no chamber of commerce in Rossendale, although there is a chamber of trade. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I agree that Blackburn is nearby and that within the area there is Darwen, where there is one of the finest chambers in the country. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) may be glad to know that the Labour-controlled Blackburn council is having useful consultations about the introduction of rate changes, whether they be increases or decreases or whether they stay as they are. The problem arises—this was the burden of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton—when consultations are not useful. Some local authorities think that they are a waste of time, a bit of a nuisance, a performance that they have to go through but that they cut to the minimum. In such cases, the consultations are often a charade.<br><br>
I can give comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton. He was right to use the word "statutory" because the provision will be written in statute. That is the first point. The second point is that we held consultations and spoke to organisations such as the ABCC and the CBI, but as I think my hon. Friend will agree, it is more difficult at local community level to hold a dialogue, for instance, with the CBI than with the chamber of commerce. The ABCC was broadly content with what was proposed in the dialogue that we had with it, but now that my hon. Friend has spoken of its concern about the guidance that may be given to local authorities on how they should consult the private sector, I am happy to assure him that we shall issue guidance to local authorities. I hope that my hon. Friend will regard that as a fair response to his comments. It is a step forward, and it is certainly more than we were prepared to offer before we heard his valid speech.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28 is a matter of acute concern to many voluntary organisations, particularly in areas that came under the metropolitan authorities before they were abolished. I shall speak first to amendment No. 135, and then comment briefly on amendment No. 104, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young). I may seek to catch your eye subsequently, Mr. Hunt, but it would seem appropriate for me to leave the hon. Gentleman to speak to his amendment.<br><br>
As I am sure all members of the Committee will agree, we have been provided with much well argued and detailed information from voluntary organisations and others, including the Law Society, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the National Consumer Council, as well as a variety of groups that are worried about the clause, and especially about subsection (9), which the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton proposes to delete.<br><br>
Amendment No. 135 relates to advice agencies that local authorities can fund. We have had briefings from the Law Society and the National Consumer Council, because they both find the issue disturbing. The aim in the amendment is to exempt local authority funding for advice services from the new limit that is proposed on expenditure in section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, where the limit is the product of a 2p rate. In clause 28(7), the Government propose to change that to £5 per head of population in single-tier authorities such as the London boroughs, and to £2.50 in two-tier local authorities.<br><br>
Section 137 is a general funding power that enables local authorities to make grants where no other specific funding power is available. It is used, in particular, to fund advice and law centres. I suspect that most of us are aware of the valuable work that is done by advice centres, such as the citizens advice bureaux, and especially by law centres, although I know that some Conservative Members—not all—do not agree that law centres do a good job. Indeed, the previous Lord Chancellor was not at all enamoured of them, and chose not to fund them from the Lord Chancellor's Department. That was one way out of the present trap in which they find themselves.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Opposition Members firmly believe that law centres and advice centres generally offer an important service. It is vital that good advice should be available for people who live in areas where there is economic and social deprivation. We live in a complex society where there are complex rules and large bureaucratic organisations, and if people's rights are to be respected, and if they themselves are to find their way through all the complexities, they need access to advice and legal systems that enable them to pursue a case against a private or public organisation.<br><br>
In my area, law centres play a vital role in that respect. Years ago, we should have thought about the need for advice to be made available on accountancy. We spend a great deal of time in this place thinking about how taxes are dealt with by accountants, and how to maximise benefit to taxpayers, but we spend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
very little time thinking about helping people on supplementary benefit to get the advice that they need to obtain the proper amount of benefit, yet those are the people who most need advice.<br><br>
General and easily accessible advice should be available in areas where many people are either on low pay or on supplementary benefit. Too little such advice is available. People should be able to obtain advice before they get into serious financial difficulty. They need help to ensure that their rights are protected. If we took more trouble to ensure that people knew about their rights to obtain supplementary benefits of one kind or another, we would avoid many difficulties and make the system much fairer.<br><br>
The existing limit on section 137 is by no means generous. The London Voluntary Service Council estimated that if the 2p rate had been increased in line with inflation, it would have been 7.5p by 1988, or nearly four times as much as it is now. The new £5 and £2.50 limit will have a devastating effect on the amount of money that is available to fund voluntary organisations, especially in London and the other metropolitan authorities.<br><br>
In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), the Under-Secretary of State—the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley)—gave figures on behalf of the Government which show that, in some areas, changes may be as much as a loss of 99.6 per cent. The estimated overall loss to London will be 62.15 per cent., and although there are some gainers in that list, the majority are losers. The figures make sobering reading. I see the Minister for Local Government looking at the table. I hope that he will bear those figures in mind when he replies, because they are causing voluntary bodies great concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 99.6 per cent. that the hon. Gentleman mentioned refers to the City of London. Bearing in mind the considerable rateable value of the area, it is clear that the proposed limit gives it considerable headroom. There has been no complaint from it. It is important to note the parts of London to which the figures refer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I hope that the Minister is not making what I would regard as a petty point. I said that I was talking about a range of figures, and that for London as a whole the figure was minus 62.15 per cent. Surely the Minister is not saying that that is unimportant. If the Minister runs his eye down the figures, he will see—I speak from memory—that about half a dozen are plus figures and the rest minuses. The Minister cannot make much capital from the fact that the City of London loses the most, which, I readily agree that that is a special case. I know that we are talking about a range of figures, but if the Minister wants to omit the City of London, I am happy to do so. However, no one can pretend that the figures shown in the table are anything other than deeply worrying to the voluntary organisations. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities estimates that its members provide approximately £45 million to £50 million per annum in funding for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
voluntary organisations which provide information, advice and legal services. I agree with the National Consumer Council that it is regrettable that we still do not have a comprehensive network of legal advice services, which we need for reasons that I have already given.<br><br>
I turn briefly to amendment No. 104, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), to make some preliminary remarks. Subsection (9) causes acute anxiety to voluntary organisations, and to some extent we are engaged in a repeat debate of the abolition Bill that went through the House in 1985. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and I were deeply involved in the debates that took place on that measure, as was the then Minister, the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton. We engaged in many exchanges about the effect that the abolition of the metropolitan authorities would have on voluntary organisations. We were deeply worried, and many of our fears have proved to be well founded. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton was anxious to assure us that voluntary organisations would be protected, and I think that that is why he has tabled the amendment. The hon. Gentleman sees a danger of losing that protection.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton went out of his way during the passage of the 1985 measure to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the voluntary sector. He must now be feeling anxious about whether the Government are betraying the commitment that he and other Ministers gave to the House of Commons at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's argument. The total amount for London that is allowed under the proposed limit is £26 million. On the most conservative estimate—we are removing economic development—the London boroughs as a whole are spending £5 million. Therefore, the headroom is between £26 million and £5 million. With that headroom, how can anyone be worried? London boroughs spend £5 million and under the proposed limits they can spend up to £26 million. I cannot see what the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is worried about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has intervened on a point that is not appropriate to what I was saying. I shall come to headroom shortly.<br><br>
There has been a loss of funding to voluntary organisations in London and in other metropolitan counties as a result of abolition. We have heard that from many organisations that either went to the wall or had to root around for funding elsewhere. The headroom issue, which the Minister raised, relates to comments that I shall make later. If the Minister wishes to intervene then, I shall happily allow him to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention is relevant in this sense. It is one thing to suggest that the loss of funding results from not having enough money and another to suggest that the loss of money, given the headroom before and after this measure is due to abolition. In London many authorities considered the grants given
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
and decided that they no longer wanted to give them. We cannot object to that, given some of the projects they used to fund. More sensible people are making more sensible decisions about the bodies that they fund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a way, the Minister betrays the authoritarian nature of the Government. He is saying that the people of London and those in the metropolitan districts who elected a Labour local authority to make decisions for them had to be overriden by a Government who decided that those people did not know what they wanted and abolished those authorities. Further, it is significant that the Govenment have abolished only Labour-controlled local authorities. They have not abolished one Conservative-controlled authority. That is because the Government do not trust the people. That was what the Minister told us by his intervention, and not for the first time.<br><br>
The loss to voluntary organisations has been for many reasons, one of which was the abolition of the Greater Londn council and the metropolitan authorities, which were funding organisations. If the Minister believes that homelessness, for example, has been helped by the abolition of the metropolitan authorities, he cannot expect anyone outside the House of Commons to believe that. We know that the number of bed places for the homeless is far fewer than before, which is due largely to the abolition of the metropolitan authorities. That is one reason why we have the tragedy of young people sleeping in cardboard boxes.<br><br>
Subsection (9) will cause an incredible increase in bureaucratic organisation and the cost of organising the present system. It has never been an efficient system or as good as the regional government structures which most modern democratic countries have. The London Borough's Grant Scheme funds about 750 voluntary organisations and has about 2,000 applications per annum. If subsection (9) becomes law they will need a legal officer to assess which power a group should be funded under, and that means employing more legal staff. That money could otherwise be given to voluntary organisations.<br><br>
In its rhetoric the Government claim to want to give money direct to organisations rather than through bureaucracies. They have shot themselves in the foot, however, because they are creating a more bureaucratic structure. It is worth turning to the London Boroughs Grant Scheme organisations, which are all-party, to learn what they have to say. They have stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The London Boroughs Grants Committee is unanimously"</p></blockquote>
—I emphasise "unanimously" to the Minister—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the view that sub-clause 28(9) should be deleted as it is wholly unnecessary. The Secretary of State can already control the Scheme's expenditure and the Government's proposals, if enacted, would add considerably to the cost of administering the Scheme. Additional staff would have to be employed using resources which would otherwise go to fund voluntary organisations. The additional time which would be spent apportioning legal powers would be better used monitoring the use organisations make of grants and ensuring, as local authorities must, that there is value for money."</p></blockquote>
That is the view held by the London Boroughs Grants Scheme, and I find myself in full agreement with its Conservative and Labour members.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
There is the so-called headroom problem. If a local authority has to change from a 2p rate system to a £5 a head system—this is the problem that the Minister has not fully grasped—and cannot manage a grant without exceeding its section 137 limit, it can threaten the stability of the scheme. One of the options open to that borough would be to cut its section 137 expenditure or to seek to oppose the budget and persuade a third of the other London boroughs also to oppose it. It will then open up the possibility for one local authority in difficulty to destabilise the system and argue for change because of its financial position. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton may wish to add to what I have just said about the amendment. The quotations from the report of the Committee on the abolition Bill are revealing—I could dwell on them for some time—and there is a rich mine of quotations from the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, which show his genuine concern for voluntary organisations.<br><br>
The matter was also raised in the House of Lords. On Third Reading of the abolition Bill on 2 July 1985, Lord Elton, who was the relevant Minister at the time, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Bill will take the funding of even more voluntary organisations out of section 137, because clause 48 gives its own power to the boroughs to act collectively to fund organisations serving more than one borough."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"I refer your Lordships to clause 48(11) on page 31, which reads:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'The powers conferred by this section shall not be regarded as restricting those conferred by section 137 of the principal Act.'"—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 July 1985; Vol. 465, c. 1116.]</p></blockquote>
That restriction is now being introduced. Under clause 28, former metropolitan county areas will have to offset any section 48 expenditure against section 137 unless some other power can be found.<br><br>
I said that I may seek to catch your eye at a later stage, Mr. Hunt, but at this point I simply say to the Minister—I hope that he will note this carefully—that an enormous number of voluntary organisations are deeply concerned about the clause. I strongly recommend that he drops it altogether. At this stage of the debate, perhaps we could have a response from him or the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton, but I urge the Minister to think very carefully. Many organisations rightly feel that their funding is threatened and that they are also threatened with much more bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to what the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) said about amendment No. 135, but I think that amendment No. 104 is preferable in that it is broader. Towards the end of his remarks, the hon. Gentleman said that he felt that it would be best if this part of the clause were withdrawn, which is what my amendment seeks, so I think it might be helpful if the debate focuses on amendment No. 104 rather than amendment No. 135.<br><br>
Those who read the Government's response to the Widdicombe report and the notes on clauses might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
be forgiven for thinking that clause 28(9) simply removes an anomaly or tidies up some administrative litter which has blown on to the statute book. Paragraph 8.19 and 8.20 of the White Paper, "The Conduct of Local Authority Business", points out that the areas covered by the former GLC and metropolitan counties have section 48 spending power as well as section 137 powers, and it is asserted that that gives local authorities a means of avoiding section 137 restrictions.<br><br>
The White Paper concluded in paragraph 8.20:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have therefore decided to bring within the financial limit on section 137 spending any spending under section 48 for which there would otherwise be no available specific power."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper does not say that the Widdicombe report made no such recommendation. Indeed, the Widdicombe report did not mention section 48 at all, let alone any abuse of it.<br><br>
If one turns to the notes on clauses to find out why the Government are proposing a change, they are even coyer. The only reason given for the change is the assertion that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unlike expenditure on contributions to such voluntary organisations in the rest of the country, expenditure under section 48 does not count against an authority's section 137 limit."</p></blockquote>
To understand why this part of clause 28 has generated such concern, one has to cast one's mind back four years to when the Local Government act 1985—the abolition Act—was going through the House. I do not want to open up Opposition wounds, but I believe that abolition was right in concept, that it was executed well, that it has been smoothly accomplished and that substantial savings and simplification have accrued to Londoners and others. I note that no other party has pledged itself to exhume either the Greater London council or the metropolitan boroughs.<br><br>
The road to abolition was not straight—we took some corners on two wheels. The biggest threat to the Bill lay in another place and was mounted on our treatment of the voluntary sector, principally in London, but also in Manchester, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) may wish to say something. As the Bill went through the House, negotiations were held with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, led by Peter Jay, and with the London Voluntary Service Council and others. The Government came under pressure from their Back Benchers in Committee.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) moved one of the key amendments in Standing Committee. Discussions also took place with Members of another place. As the Bill progressed, it was amended substantially. Concessions were made to reflect the way in which the voluntary sector in London and the metropolitan boroughs was funded. A package was assembled which secured the assent of both Houses of Parliament. All Minister in Committee voted for the package, tidy or otherwise. When it was presented, a number of undertakings were given by Ministers, in particular about its stability. That package is now being picked apart and those undertakings are about to be broken.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) quoted one such remark by my noble Friend Lord
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
Elton, a Minister in the other place. The sentence that I wish to quote is:
<br><blockquote><p>"The powers conferred by this section"—</p></blockquote>
section 48—
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be regarded as restricting those conferred by section 137 of the principal Act".—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2 July 1988; Vol. 465, c. 1116.]</p></blockquote>
However, that is what the proposed subsection would do.<br><br>
In Standing Committee on 26 February 1985, I made the same point:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman will see from clause 46(6) that funds spent under the collective arrangements that we are now discussing are exempted from section 137."—[<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee, 26 February 1985: c. 165.]</p></blockquote>
On 27 March 1985, I stressed that a separate funding power was intended, and stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"As with clause 47, the whole of the scheme involves a new grant-giving power outside section 137 expenditure, the restrictions of which cause concern to the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 March 1985; Vol. 76 c. 375.]</p></blockquote>
The late Mr. Harry Cowans was Member of Parliament for that constituency at the time.<br><br>
We did all that we could to reassure the voluntary sector that the system that we were setting up would last. I stressed several times that the Government's objective was a stable and durable system and that, in addition to the stable framework enshrined in law by the Government, the boroughs should also play their part in the stability. I said that the importance of the lasting scheme was so crucial that the Government had amended their Bill to ensure the necessary durability of the scheme.<br><br>
On 26 February 1985, I stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Having listened to the arguments for amendment No. 807,"—</p></blockquote>
that is some indication of the length of those proceedings—
<br><blockquote><p>"I am persuaded that the present drafting in the Bill may not give sufficient authority, security and durability to the arrangements for collective grant giving as suggested in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Batley and Spen. The amendment may be defective, but if she and the Committee are content, I undertake, instead of accepting the present amendment, to table a suitable amendment on Report."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 26 February 1985; c. 1661.]</p></blockquote>
In a nutshell, we accepted that section 48 was necessary because of the special position in the cities, where city-wide projects are a necessary and efficient way of tackling city-wide problems. My noble Friend Lord Elton repeated many of the assurances, which are reproduced in c. 1087 of the House of Lords <i>Hansard</i> of 2 July 1985.<br><br>
The Government are now going back on those commitments. If section 48 is no longer a separate funding power, borrowers and voluntary organisations may lose as a result of abolition, which was the one consequence that we were desperate to avoid.<br><br>
In spite of what was done at the time, many people thought that the new arrangements would not work. I was pleased to read in the minutes of the meeting held by my right hon. Friend at the Department of the Environment on 15 March with the London boroughs grants committee the remarks of councillor David Williams who chairs the committee. The minutes say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Councillor Williams was concerned about the effect on the volutary sector and that the proposals had caused great alarm there. At the time of GLC abolition the voluntary sector had also been very concerned and to give the Government credit, the arrangements had not proved disastrous for voluntary organisations as it turned out. The Government had set up the Scheme and the London boroughs had made it work."</p></blockquote>
My first reason for moving the amendment is my fear that the Government will go back on undertakings given in good faith and that we will risk losing the goodwill secured with some difficulty from the voluntary movement in London—goodwill that I know is valued by all Ministers in Committee, who have a proud record of commitment to the movement.<br><br>
The Minister may ask, as he did at the meeting to which I referred, why local government in the metropolitan counties should not be subject to the same section 137 discipline as is the rest of the country. I understand the force of his question, quite apart from the point that I have just made.<br><br>
There are serious difficulties in reconciling the simple discipline of section 137 with the collective arrangements in section 48. When the collective section 48 spoon dips into the individual section 137 pot the difficulties referred to by the hon. Member for Hammersmith arise. They are not replicated outside the metropolitan districts, where there are different arrangements for funding the voluntary sector.<br><br>
The implications of what will happen if the amendment is not accepted are awful. At present, section 48 is a spending power in its own right, so it is unnecessary to determine other legal powers for each grant recommended and approved under that section. Under the Government's proposals, every application for section 48 funding would need specific funding powers to be identified so that the balance not covered by such powers could be seen as potential section 137 expenditure.<br><br>
Although some organisations can be funded by virtue of other specific funding powers, many cannot. Where initial examination suggests that a grant cannot be made entirely under specific funding powers, grant officers will have to obtain from applicants verified apportionment of the time that they spend on section 137 activities so that any grant that is agreed can be apportioned accordingly and shown to be reasonable.<br><br>
There is no doubt on either side of the Committee that the new procedures will be more time consuming for grant officers. The scheme will have to employ more officers when the Government are rightly exerting downward pressure on local government costs and manpower. Every application would need to go before a legal officer to ensure that the correct funding power was being used and that the committee was acting reasonably by approving the grant. The officer would have to approve the proposed apportionment of section 137 and non-section 137 funding. There are no resources—certainly not in London—to undertake that work at present. Estimates show that between £36,000 and £100,000 would have to be spent in London to process the new arrangements.<br><br>
There are also problems for the boroughs in dealing with their section 137 allocations. The Bill envisages
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
that, when the London Grants Committee agrees its recommended expenditure for the following financial year each November, it will identify the proportion of its expenditure that falls under section 137 and then advise the boroughs of the total amount and of the proportion falling to each authority. Those amounts would then have to come out of each borough's contribution to the grants scheme.<br><br>
There are several problems. For example, there is the question of whether the boroughs will give up part of their drastically reduced section 137 allocations. If not, the scheme could not give section 137 grants and the viability of a far greater number of grants that are funded partly under section 137 would also be called into question.<br><br>
The boroughs would be asked to give up their section 137 allocations without necessarily knowing on what projects their allocations would be spent or whether they would be spent in the forthcoming year. There will also be problems for the lead borough, which will need section 137 cover over and above its ordinary allocation.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
It seems nonsensical to indulge in bureaucracy and administration for no tangible gain. The hon. Member for Hammersmith read out a statement from the London Boroughs Grant Scheme. In an informal conversation, Sir Peter Bowness, the Conservative leader of the London Boroughs Association, confirmed to me last Friday that he was against the Government's proposals and that he hoped that the Government would think again. The briefing that the LBA sent to all members of the Committee on Second Reading stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Association is very concerned about the £5 per capita limit on discretionary spending as it will seriously affect the lower populated boroughs like the City of London and Westminster City Council. Moreover the offset of money given to voluntary bodies will severely limit the ability of local authorities to support voluntary groups serving the needs of the local community."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that no member of the Committee would allege that Westminster was an extravagant authority. Its present limit is £6.68 million. The proposed limit in the Bill is £730,000, which is all that Westminster will be able to spend. At present, excluding economic development powers, Westminster funds £2.75 million under section 137. In other words, it is already about £2 million over the Government's suggested limit, without taking into account anything that would come to Westminster under section 48.<br><br>
The present limit of Kensington and Chelsea is £1.41 million, which will fall to £570,000—a reduction of about 60 per cent. Even the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea might be inconvenienced by the Government's plans.<br><br>
My final question is "Whodunnit?", and why. It is certainly not the responsibility of the Conservative party in London. I have quoted the remarks of Sir Peter Bowness, who is against the Government on this issue. It is not the responsibility of the Widdicombe committee. I have read the Widdicombe report and it does not even mention section 48. It is not the responsibility of the bodies
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
running the scheme—the London boroughs grants committee and the organisation in Manchester—both of which have contacted me anxiously.<br><br>
I am not aware that it is the responsibility of Conservative Members. Certainly no London Member has raised the issue. I dare say that it is not even the responsibility of Ministers. I cannot believe that the Minister for Local Government lies awake at night worrying about abuse of section 48 expenditure in London. I do not even think that it is the responsibility of the Treasury, which is the usual villain in the piece, because there is an existing power to cap section 48 expenditure under the scheme.<br><br>
The answer to my question is probably a tidy-minded civil servant, and several possibilities spring immediately to mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it might be a litter-conscious Prime Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I prefer the culprit that I had in mind, who sees the arrangement as an anomaly. We knew that it was an anomaly when we set it up. The voluntary organisations in the cities are different from those elsewhere and need different funding.<br><br>
I see no benefit to the Government in proceeding down this path, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government concludes that it is not worth the candle and that he supports amendment No. 104.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), I did not contribute enormously to the Committee that considered the 1985 Bill, although I served on it. The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) will remember that I was a parliamentary private secretary, and monastic silence is imposed on those holding such high and influential posts.<br><br>
This is the second time in a year that I am speaking to clause 28 of a Bill. I wonder whether there is a subtle arrangement whereby controversial matters arise under clause 28.<br><br>
I wish to say quite a bit about amendment No. 135, which was moved by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), and on amendment No. 104 of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, which I support.<br><br>
At the time of abolition, the Government's commitment was clear—section 48 would not be a transitional arrangement. Other arrangements were to be transitional, but not section 48. Its purpose was to relieve the burdens on the section 137 accounts, especially as in the metropolitan areas the authorities' capability to spend under section 137 was being halved with the abolition of the metropolitan counties. The intention behind section 48 was and is to fund organisations which straddle two or more authorities. The problem is not merely London-based. There is a danger, however, especially as my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and I are Greater London Members, that it will be seen as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
such. Problems in other parts of the country link directly with the consequence of undertakings given at the time of abolition, ensuring that they, too, will be caught by the impact of clause 28(9), if it is enacted.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton questioned the reason for the clause. Certainly it is not because the current system is being abused. If that were so, it is reasonable to assume that, either through the Civil Service or usual ministerial word of mouth, evidence would have been received. Like other Committee members, I have received submissions from many sources. According to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, last month my right hon. Friend met the three group leaders of the London Boroughs Grants Scheme and said that the conditions under which the scheme operated were satisfactory. My right hon. Friend repeated today that he had reservations about some groups being supported, but said that it was not an issue as it was up to the grants committee to decide how to spend its money. No doubt all Committee members would agree with that.<br><br>
I wish to underline how the scheme works. It is important to emphasise how different section 48 schemes are from other funding arrangements. The NCVO states:
<br><blockquote><p>"They were introduced to ensure satisfactory arrangements for funding voluntary groups whose work covered more than a single borough or metropolitan district. It was recognised by the Government at the time"—</p></blockquote>
that is, at the time of the legislation—
<br><blockquote><p>"that unless there were specific arrangements for enabling the local authorities in the metropolitan areas to join together these kinds of projects would not be supported. Even with the arrangements in the 1985 Act, it has not always been easy for these schemes to function effectively. There are inevitably difficulties"—</p></blockquote>
as we saw in the early stages in London—
<br><blockquote><p>"involved in getting different local authorities … to work together".</p></blockquote>
That is whether or not they are under different political control. That adds flavouring to an already interesting meal! We should not underestimate the difficulties that are encountered in getting the scheme to work effectively.<br><br>
Section 48 schemes are different because of the different arrangements under which they operate. The NCVO states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any attempts now to eliminate these differences will put further strain on what has always been a fragile system. And there is no good reason for doing so."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton said that there is an anomaly when comparisons are made with areas outside the metropolitan districts, but local government contains many anomalies. Before abolition of the metropolitan counties, the powers exercised by the metropolitan districts were different from those exercised by the non-metropolitan districts. Now, after abolition, there are unitary authorities in the metropolitan districts whereas, outside, there are still district and county organisations.<br><br>
These are massive anomalies and yet, apparently, a nice clean procedure is being sought, under which local authorities everywhere will operate in exactly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
the same way. There are anomalies in the very nature of local government because its priorities are not always the same as the Government's. The argument for change must be stronger than the contention that the system looks a bit untidy. It must be that it is not working or is working unfairly, or that there are overwhelming economic reasons for change.<br><br>
The consequence of clause 28(9) will increase the cost of administering the present scheme. I quote from a letter from David Williams, chairman of the London Boroughs Grants Committee, who writes expressing the unanimous views of all political parties in London. He says that the proposals will be time-consuming and expensive and adds:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have estimated that it would cost another £100,000 a year in administrative costs to employ at least two additional legal advisers and an additional finance officer to ensure that all grant proposals had powers correctly attributed to them. This is money which, within a restricted budget, could be much better spent on grants to voluntary organisations and does not represent a sensible use of officer time. The Committee does not want to see its officials having to spend time apportioning legal powers to grant applications when that time would be better used monitoring how funded voluntary organisations use the grants they are given and ensuring, as local authorities must, that there is value for money for the support which the Committee gives."</p></blockquote>
There is a bureaucratic cost that leads directly to the uncertainty that many organisations face. I have received represenations from many organisations—for example, legal advice groups—that feel threatened. No-one knows exactly which groups are threatened because the structure of the clause ensures that it will be several months before councils are able to determine who is affected.<br><br>
I shall outline the position in Manchester to emphasise that the problem does not apply only to London. In greater Manchester, the scheme is the largest outside greater London. Its section 48 scheme budget for 1989–90 is approximately £3.25 million. With that it funds nearly 100 continuing schemes and about 100 one-off activities during the current financial year. They cover a wide range of social, cultrual, economic, environmental and community activities. The scheme operates on a prudent basis. Since abolition, the budget has grown only with inflation, except in two special circumstances which have led to the districts allowing extra funds. All grants are carefully scrutinised at officer and member level annually, or during the financial year, for one-off grants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was fascinated by the comments about Manchester made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch, Mr. Squire. As he may be aware, I have historical connections with Manchester. I draw his attention to a meeting of an organisation called Nestwork that is funded in the way that he mentioned. The meeting took place on Thursday 16 March, and the organisation's leaflet states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nestwork is for women interested in joining a new Self Insemination Support Group…Nestwork is the name of our new group which will help women city wide to get pregnant by Alternative Insemination."</p></blockquote>
The footnote—my hon. Friend may wish to consider one or two names in this connection—states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We need to get in contact with possible sperm donors. If you do know of anyone, you can contact us at …"</p></blockquote></span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend, who with his great knowledge of Manchester has brought that example to my attention. Judging from the way that he brought it forward he did not support that use of the funding. It is his absolute right and the right of every member of the Committee, individually or collectively, to disagree with the individual use of grants. I quote no higher authority than my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government who says that there is no general abuse of the scheme. It would be wrong to condemn this nationwide proposal on the basis of one scheme, or possibly half a dozen, about which members may not agree.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In one of the earlier sittings my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) responded to my comments by saying that he took offence to being called a pot-bellied squire. This morning, my hon. Friend went one stage further by indicating that in the not too distant past he was a Trappist monk. I keep an open mind on the organisation, but can I take it from my hon. Friend's comments that perhaps he would like me to send his Westminster telephone number to that group?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if I remain a Trappist monk I shall not be in demand by that group. My point was that many good and useful organisations are threatened by the proposal.<br><br>
Outside the Committee there has been widespread opposition to this simple subsection. That does not mean that the opposition is right, but it it important for the Committee and the Government to be made aware of that opposition which runs through organisations such as the Law Society and the National Consumer Council which are not usually regarded as hotbeds for the start of the Red revolution. That opposition is voiced by all political parties in London and within other areas already mentioned.<br><br>
The need for clause 28 has not been proved because already my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has powers under the legislation. Section 48 does not give an unlimited power because the Secretary of State can set a limit on expenditure. Early in 1987 the Secretary of State issued a draft order for consultation to break the deadlock that existed on the 1987–88 budget. The committee and the boroughs accepted the proposals for expenditure of £28.5 million for 1987–88 for London and the committee has operated at that level of expenditure since then without any increase for inflation in 1988–89. The 1989–90 budget has been frozen at the same level, a proposal made by the Labour party.<br><br>
Clause 28(9) not only reneges on a three-year commitment; it ignores the central reason for creating section 48; it is bureaucratic and costly and the uncertainty will threaten a number of voluntary organisations which are doing good work. It is opposed by virtually everybody outside and ultimately it is unnecessary because the powers already exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the case and confess that at the outset I did not believe in section 137 funding,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
but numerous colleagues in other authorities have explained to me the folly of my ways. I recollect at the time of the miners' strike that South Yorkshire county council decided to give money under section 137 to a trust. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) keeps reminding me, when I was deputy chairman of the South Yorkshire residuary body a crock of money remained from the miners' strike which was to be distributed to the ratepayers of south Yorkshire.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) was very selective in his quotations from the report of the National Consumer Council. The last paragraph says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Spending on economic activities has declined sharply in London since 1984/5 and especially since the abolition of the GLC."</p></blockquote>
It is also true that, since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils, the amount spent on section 137 funding has declined. My right hon. Friend the Minister said that there were powers for economic development in clause 25, and I imagine that those powers will be used to enable some of the economic development work to be carried out by local authorities.<br><br>
We have heard much today about maximum headroom, and I have discovered that it means the cash that is available to be spent under section 137. In 1986–87, in England, that was £253 million, of which the outturn was £47 million, representing 19 per cent. of the headroom, with a per capita equivalent of £1.30. I accept that it was less than in 1984–85, when the headroom was £354 million, with an outturn of £118 million—33 per cent. being spent—and a per capita equivalent of £3.26. The figures for the GLC area also show a diminishing amount, from a per capita basis of £8.93 in 1984–85 to £1.71.<br><br>
The National Consumer Council's brief states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite the fact that the Widdicombe report found that in 1984/5 nationally 67% of section 137 funding was spent on economic and employment development activities",</p></blockquote>
the figures are different, because the maximum amount of money that was available was not spent. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is anxiously waiting to hear that Sheffield city council had £1.5 million available for spending in 1988–89, and that in 1986–87, it spent £0.6 million. The new limit on a per capita basis for 1991 will be £2.09 million. I hear Opposition Members shrieking, "We have been hit"—I would never make such comments about Conservative Members—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not another joke about squires, it it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but in the miraculous way in which information occasionally surfaces in Committee, I have just been advised that the organisation mentioned earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) is not backed by section 48. My hon. Friend will want to know that.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it will set the record straight.<br><br>
I am arguing that funding is available, and that the new proposals show that the funds that were originally envisaged in section 137 were never spent. I accept that section 137 funds can be used for the wonderful ideas of the Sheffield city council, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Brightside is not in his seat. But if the Flat Earth Society ever landed in England and it were given political asylum by a council, which local authority would it be? My guess is that it would be Sheffield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bradford.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), Bradford is not like that. It has done some wonderful things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) taking the bait. Because of the cuts in support for charitable organisations there in Bradford the Minister had to give them £227,000 to help them over the hurdle. Charities in Bradford are suffering tremendously because Bradford authority will not spend the section 137 money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will pick up that remark. Suffice so say that Bradford got more funding because it used its budget on Bradford's problems and so could obtain more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the decisions in Bradford have been made to ensure that in future the funding of voluntary organisations will not have political involvement and will be done on a more sensible and realistic basis of need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members seem to have an obsession with the name Pickles. I hasten to assure the Committee that Judge Pickles and Eric Pickles are not related.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that I responded so positively because, in his usual accomplished manner, the distinguished leader of Bradford city council put his case in such a way that I believed that it was worth supporting? Had he not done so, I would not have responded so positively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always found my hon. Friend most helpful when a case is made to him. He has assisted Sheffield. I should make it publicly known that he is called the Minister for Sheffield, but Bradford would not accept that title.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The record must be put straight. The Minister says tht Bradford is underspent and the hon. Member for Hallam refers to section 137. I say that Bradford's allocation has been cut. In last Friday's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
<i>Yorkshire Post</i> Councillor Pickles, the leader of Sheffield, said that with the Labour authority he has lobbied Parliament for extra money to help Bradford. How can the Minister say that Bradford is underspent, when the Tory leader of Bradford has constantly lobbied him for extra money to spend in Bradford? Who is telling the truth—Councillor Pickles or the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton made a Freudian slip. If only Councillor Pickles was the leader of Sheffield council. I am sure that the city would be in far better hands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be stretching the credulity of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) to breaking point to expect him to believe that both might be telling the truth. It happens quite often in our party. When Councillor Pickles was leader of the Opposition he approached the Department of the Environment with the leader of the Labour group and asked me for an increased allocation. I responded positively but, under the leadership of the Labour party, the council still underspent the amount for which it had asked me. That is crass inefficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hallam understands section 137 fully. It is the product of a 2p rate. Local authorities are not required to spend up to the limit of section 137. If they did, the Minister would no doubt deploy a different argument and say that they were spending unnecessarily. Many local authorities have had to use their money to look after other areas of expenditure and cannot afford to devote the product of a 2p rate to section 137.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has lost sight of the fact that the product of a 2p rate under section 137 has existed for many a long year and has been used as a device. As a former chairman of the Greater London council he may remember that some of the council's patronage was used to dispose of section 137 money.<br><br>
I realise that a good authority does not spend all its rate or its section 137 money. It has been argued that funding will be reduced by a great amount, but that is not true. It is the notional funding that will be reduced. If local authorities had spent up to the limit before the period when sanity started to prevail, I am convinced that—</span></p>
