DUTY TO PREVENT DEBIT BALANCE ON HOUSING REVENUE ACCOUNT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this motion, we shall consider Government new clause 9—<i>Duty to prevent debit balance on Housing Revenue Account</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>' .—(1) This section applies where for any year ("the relevant year") a local housing authority who are required to keep a Housing Revvenue Account possess any houses or other property within the account.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) The authority shall, during the months of January and February immediately preceding the relevant year, formulate proposals which satisfy the requirements of subsection (3) below and relate to—
<ol>
<li>the income of the authority for the year from rents and other charges in respect of houses and other property within their Housing Revenue Account;</li>
<li>the expenditure of the authority for the year in respect of the repair maintenance, supervision and management of such property; and</li>
<li>such other matters connected with the exercise of the authority's functions in relation to such property as the Secretary of State may direct.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) Proposals formulated by the authority under subsection (2) above satisfy the requirements of this subsection at any time if, on the assumption that the following will prove correct, namely—
<ol>
<li>the best assumptions that they are able to make at that time as to all matters which may affect the amounts falling to be credited or debited to their Housing Revenue Account for the relevant year; and</li>
<li>the best estimates that they are able to make at that time of the amounts which, on those assumptions, will fall to be so credited or debited,</li></ol>
implementation of the proposals will secure that the account for that year does not show a debit balance.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) No assumptions shall be made under subsection (3) above as to the exercise by the Secretary of State of any power except on the basis of information published by him or on his behalf or supplied by him to the authority.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Subject to subsections (6) and (7) below, the authority shall implement the proposals formulated by them under subsection (2) above.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(6) The authority shall from time to time determine whether the proposals formulated under subsection (2) above satisfy the requirements of subsection (3) above; and—
<ol>
<li>if they determine that question in the affirmative, they may make such revisions of the proposals as they think fit, so long as the proposals (as so revised) contnue to satisfy those requirements;</li>
<li>if they determine that question in the negative, they shall make such revisions of the proposals as are reasonably practicable towards securing that the proposals (as so revised) satisfy those requirements.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7)Where the proposals formulated under subsection (2) above are revised under subsection (6) above, subsections (3) to (6) above shall apply in relation to the proposals as so revised as they applied in relation to the proposals as originally formulated.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 906</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) The authority shall, within one month of formulating their proposals under subsection (2) above, or of revising those proposals under subsection (6) above, prepare a statement setting out—
<ol>
<li>those proposals as so formulated or so revised;</li>
<li>the estimates made by them under subsection (3)(b) above on the basis of which those proposals were so formulated or so revised; and</li>
<li>such other particulars relating to those proposals and estimates as the Secretary of State may direct;</li></ol>
and a direction under paragraph (c) above may specify the manner in which the particulars are to be set out in the statement.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9) The authority shall, until the end of the year next following the relevant year, keep copies of the statement which is for the time being the latest statement prepared by them under subsection (8) above available for inspection by the public without charge at all reasonable hours at one or more of their offices; and any person shall be entitled to take copies of, or extracts from, that statement when so made available'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As two of the hon. Members who represent Sheffield are members of the Committee, I am sure that it is our wish to extend to them our especial concern and condolence on Saturday's awful tragedy.<br><br>
New clause 9 to replace clause 65 is an attempt to make that clause clearer. It is sometimes suggested that we should endeavour to explain why we have second thoughts, but I do not intend to do that. I merely say that the new clause makes the matter much clearer, and has the great advantage of starting at the beginning, moving through the middle, and ending at the end. The original clause was more complicated and difficult to understand because it did not follow—as I would have said to the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), had he been here—Aristotelian logic.<br><br>
The purpose of the new clause is twofold. First, it would require a local housing authority to make a budget each year—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do that now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —in a manner that would ensure that there was no deficit on the housing account. It is not an extra onerous duty because, as the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) says, housing committees make budgets in any case. All it requires is that the budget must ensure that there is no deficit. Having drawn up the initial budget before the start of the year, the local housing authority would be required to keep the account under review, and to revise the budget, if a deficit seemed likely to arise.<br><br>
The original clause was less clear and might lead an authority to make mid-term changes, irrespective of whether such changes were possible or realistic. As that is not our intention, the new clause makes it clear tha only mid-term changes that could be carried out realistically would be made. If it appeared likely, mid-term, that the housing account would go into deficit, such changes as could reasonably be made would have to be made, and if there were a deficit at the end of year, that deficit would have to be carried forward and taken into account in the next year's budget. It would still be essential to take whatever steps were reasonable during the course of the year.<br><br>
The new clause is more easily understood than clause 65. It seems to meet one of the concerns that were expressed about the original clause. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 65 should not stand part of the Bill and that new clause 9 should take its place.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 907</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with the Minister's comments about the tragedy at Sheffield. I think that all of us find words inadequate on such an occasion, and we simply recognise the support that has been given to those who have suffered.<br><br>
With new clause 9 the government seem to have made a concession to us, perhaps unwillingly, to judge from the Minister's opening remarks. However, I accept it, as I am always grateful for small mercies. I never look a gift horse in the mouth, although it is a small gift horse. It is one of those where one undoes the wrapping and loses the present in discarding the wrapping. Nevertheless, new clause 9 reflects some of the thinking behind our amendment No. 436, which I think the Minister has picked up.<br><br>
I should like to ask the Minister some questions, because he has not fully covered some of the points which I wanted covered. He seemed to say that the figure for the housing revenue acount would be worked out in January or February, not at the end of November, to see whether there was a deficit. That is what our amendment No. 436 sought. I am not sure why the Minister thinks that it is necessary to go into so much detail in legislation. Why are local authorities being pressed in this way when they already have a duty not to make a debit? As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said, there is a duty on them already. Why make this addition? What does the Minister fear will happen that is not already allowed for in existing legislation?<br><br>
I should also like to know the reason for new subsection (8) in new clause 9, which requires a local authority to make a formal statement of its determination. That is a curiously bureaucratic way of proceeding. The Government keep telling us that they are trying to get rid of bureaucracy and make local authorities more efficient, so why do they keep imposing additional, often bureaucratic, burdens on them? That will be the impact of new clause 9.<br><br>
Most important is how local authorities can be expected to make a reasonable estimate whether they will be in debit when they do not know the Secretary of State's decision on subsidy. The Opposition and local authorities constantly complain that local authorities find it increasingly difficult to make plans well in advance and keep to them, simply because the Government cannot work out their sums well in advance and inform the local authorities. As I have said many times in Committee and before, local authorities cannot manage efficiently because of that. As I said to the Minister, most private companies would not be expected to operate in that way. Most of them, especially the larger ones which are comparable to local authorities, have some idea well in advance of what their income will be on a year-by-year basis. Local authorities often do not know that until a few months in advance, and on one or two occasions, they have not even known the income on some accounts until the end of the financial year.<br><br>
I should like an assurance from the Secretary of State that decisions on subsidy will be made earlier and that the information will be given to local authorities. We want to know whether the decisions will be made before Christmas. As the Minister is in the mood to give us presents this morning, perhaps I can urge him to give us another present. Will he assure us that this year and in future—unlike last year when the decision was made very late—the Secretary of State will make a decision well before Christmas and let the local authorities know? In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 908</span>
that way they can have at least several months in which to plan and they will not be left to juggle their accounts at the very last minute, as no good business would want to do. We shall be happier about new clause 9 if the Minister can complete his gift shop opening with that guarantee. He has already responded to some of our anxieties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) should feel that my gift horse is really my little pony. I had hoped that on this occasion we would agree. When I have answered his questions, he may be prepared to say that it has grown in stature.<br><br>
The formal way in which the clause is presented is designed to produce greater accountability. It will be part of a local authority's responsibility not to have a deficit and it is therefore necessary that people know how the accounts should be managed. That has been clearly laid down to ensure greater accountability. Clarity in the presentation of budgets has not been significant in one or two local authorities. I hope that it will become more significant.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that by the end of December each year, local authorities will be aware of the subsidies. They will normally know before Christmas. I prefer the old way of doing things, and that makes a tidier and neater package. We may disagree about the formal statement but that is a small disagreement in a Committee that has greater things to argue about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am walking around the horse and inspecting it carefully. I am not sure about its origins or how it will stand up to the race. I shall keep the wrapping paper, fold it neatly and give it back to the Minister so that he can give us something later.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the clarity of accounting. That is a bit much from a Government who try to hide or juggle figures. When I tried to discover the cost of consultation on housing action trusts, I was initially told that it was commercially confidential and that I could not have the figures. It took a spate of questions and battles before I obtained the incredible figure of £900,000 from the Minister. That was an exorbitant rip-off of the public to tell them what they already knew. Local authorities do not take kindly to being lectured about the clarity or purpose of accounting from a Government that have such a poor record.<br><br>
I note the Minister's words that normally local authorities will know about the subsidies before Christmas. That is encouraging. Leaders of councils will find that little note from the Secretary of State in their stockings just before Christmas. The Minister has said that if they do not know before Christmas, at least they will know by new year's eve. That is a step in the right direction. Local authorities will keep a close eye on that assurance because there should be no exceptions to it. There is no good reason why the Secretary of State should not give the level of subsidy before Christmas. We shall judge his performance accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To make sure that the gift horse becomes greater, the subsidies will be given as a Christmas rather than a new year present, largely because I do not wish to sanctify so pagan a festival. That will upset the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), who will no doubt use his favourite word, "sanctimonious", again. I hope that no local authority will use the formal

determination of its housing budget to include matters of little relevance, as did the hon. Gentleman in his previous speech.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DIRECTIONS TO SECURE PROPER ACCOUNTING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is puzzling. Its construction makes it vague. It is general and gives unacceptably wide powers to the Secretary of State. Would that it were as precise as some of the local authority housing accounts that it seeks to criticise. Perhaps the corollary is for local government to confer upon itself powers to direct the Secretary of State to say exactly what he means in proposed legislation. The Minister must explain why the clause is in the Bill?<br><br>
The Minister and his colleagues agree that most authorities, especially those in the north, are run efficiently and take due account of their electorate. The Minister accepted that, as recorded in column 666 of <i>Hansard</i> on 6 April. Moreover, he has prescribed in the Bill what is to be included in the housing revenue and housing repairs accounts, how housing subsidies will be paid, how to treat debit and credit balances, so is the power contained in the clause necessary?<br><br>
In view of all the prescription in the Bill, can it be assumed that the Secretary of State anticipates some illegal expenditure? To presume so gives scant regard to other checks and balances on local authority accounts. In addition to the normal accounting conventions and the various codes of practice issued by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, there is the external auditor. It is his duty, in examining a local authority's accounts, to issue a report on any serious irregularities and to disallow illegal expenditure. Is it to be assumed that the Secretary of State is standing in the stead of the external auditor or, even worse, are we to presume that the Secretary of State will issue a direction that accounts that have been subjected to external audit are to be rectified?<br><br>
The final safeguard which renders the clause unnecessary is the professionalism of chief finance officers. Legislation requires local authorities to ensure that one officer is responsible for the administration of financial affairs. It requires that he belongs to an approved accountancy body and it has bestowed on him further powers to deal with the possibility of illegal expenditure. After all that effort, is a chief finance officer not now to be trusted accurately to account for the actions of his authority?<br><br>
Perhaps the Government fear the recent growth in creative accountancy, which has arisen essentially from the severe expenditure restrictions imposed on local authorities. The Government may wonder why local authorities have not yet ground to a halt and intend to pursue that avenue. It is a little sardonic that creative accounting worries the same people who, in announcing an increase in the gross provision for housing expenditure, could in the same calculation reduce the actual new money available.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister will explain why this extremely puzzling clause is in the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 910</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) may recall that we discussed the clause in connection with clause 63—not out of order, Sir Anthony, but because we had to do so. I went to some lengths to explain the connection. The hon. Gentleman has nothing to worry about in respect of clause 67 because the provision has been enshrined in other housing legislation for some time.<br><br>
Last week I explained that the clause allows the Secretary of State to define more closely the term "proper treatment" where proper accounting practice would allow a range of different treatments of an item. That would allow close comparability between the practice and performance of different authorities.<br><br>
Clause 67 also provides a back-up power to deal with unusual cases where it would not be sensible to follow usual accounting practice. On the rare occasions when the corresponding power has been used under present legislation, it has been at the behest of the local authority. That should give the hon. Gentleman some comfort.<br><br>
I said that I would refer to existing powers. These are in the Housing Act 1985. Subsection (1) of clause 67 deals with the general power to direct accounting practice. Subsection (2) gives power to direct corrections in an authority's account. In the past, it has been used rarely and only to assist a local authority, at its request, when the general rules do not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister closely. He has cited other Acts which empower the Secretary of State to give directions when accounts have been submitted. Clause 67 provides for the Secretary of State to introduce directions if certain items in the accounts are not considered proper. Is the Minister advising us that under clause 67 inspectors will be appointed by the Department of the Environment to check whether items have been properly recorded? We are talking specifically of the housing revenue account, which could relate to estate management and rents and so on. How does the Minister envisage that being recorded so that the Secretary of State may give directions if an error occurs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no difficulty there. Let me allay the hon. Gentleman's fears. Inspectors would not have to be appointed. The monitoring of the housing revenue account and its components will be the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and, in the vast majority of cases, the day-to-day responsibility of the regional offices of the Department of the Environment and their controllers of housing. The duties that we shall impose on those civil servants are no more onerous than duties which they already handle day by day. No more effective policing will be required.<br><br>
The housing revenue account is made up of several components. Last week we discussed which properites were within the HRA. I also explained which expenditures on and incomes from the properties were within the HRA. In addition, I explained, as the hon. Gentleman will remember, which accounting practices were appropriate on those expenditures and incomes.<br><br>
I cannot say more clearly that the power that the Secretary of State is reserving for himself in the clause is no different from that which was available to him under previous legislation which was used only at the request of the local authority for certain contingencies.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 911</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing a second intervention. Subsection (2)(a) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"items provided for by or under this Parliament"</p></blockquote>
which
<br><blockquote><p>"have not been properly credited or debited to the account".</p></blockquote>
How can the Secretary of State, or even regional civil servants, know whether an item has been properly credited or debited from, for example the housing repairs account, without investigation? Who tells them? Who blows the whistle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The district auditor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman express himself in that way. The procedure is no different from any other standard accountancy practice in local government. The district auditor will draw the DOE's attention to a practice that is irregular or not in accordance with the legislation. There is no difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply raises a further question. I have always assumed that if there is a discrepancy or any doubt whether an item should be credited or debited, the district auditor first discusses it with the chief executive, the housing director, the leader of the council or the chairman of the housing committee. Is the Minister now saying that the district auditor must draw the item to the attention of the regional civil servants at the DoE instead of sorting it out with the local authority? Are we changing direction on this important issue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, we are not changing direction. The district auditor does not have power to direct that changes should be made. He has a responsibility to draw the matter to the attention of the chief accounting, finance and monitoring officers. He must also inform the DoE. The powers in the clause are the back-up that the Secretary of State may require to effect any necessary change. The powers certainly would not be vested in the district auditor, so there is no need for concern.<br><br>
I believe that I have dealt with all the questions of the hon. Members for City of Durham and for Normanton, and I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments to find out the detail behind the clause. The Bill lacks detail, whereas the consultation paper gives more information.<br><br>
Clauses 68 and 69 seek to replace the existing subsidy provisions of the Housing Act 1985. The amendment would retain some of the sections of the 1985 Act to draw attention to the Bill's lack of detail about how the new subsidy system will work.<br><br>
Sections 421 and 427 of the 1985 Act contain six detailed provisions setting out how the current subsidy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 912</span>
system works and giving details of the local contributions differential. They give the base amount and the housing cost differential, and explain how subsidy is calculated using those factors.<br><br>
The Bill has two clauses on the main housing subsidy which contain no detail. They appear only to give the Secretary of State draconian powers. We have discussed more than once our fears about the burden that will be imposed on his frail figure. With all the planning problems and goodness knows what else we fear for his health and safety as he takes more and more powers unto his bosom. The last time I saw him walking down the Corridor he did not look too well, and these additional responsibilities will accelerate that process.<br><br>
All the detail is in the consultation paper, not in the Bill, which seems somewhat strange. I seek an undertaking from the Minister that at an appropriate stage he will put the detail into the Bill so that people know precisely how the provision will operate. At present, there is confusion and a lack of understanding, and it would help if matters were clarified.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would wish me to thank the the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) for his kind inquiries about his health. As I had a long meeting with my right hon. Friend this morning, I can advise the Committee that his health is excellent and his brain is as acute as ever. As to clutching at his bosom, that is a picture on which I prefer not to dwell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is unkind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it might appear sexist if I were to take that further and I need to be careful about such matters.<br><br>
It is true that there is less in the Bill about the formula of subsidy than was in the 1985 Act, but we are consulting local government about the various components and we want their advice on providing flexibility. We should target help more sensibly and I acknowledge that there can be worry about the changes that are proposed. However, I assure the hon. Member for Knowsley, North that we intend to make changes so that help is given to those who need it.<br><br>
A balance needs to be struck. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is worried about the powers of the Secretary of State. I hope that he will accept that the Bill will make it possible for my right hon. Friend and other Ministers to carry out consultations that are necessary if we are to proceed in the best way. We are now engaged in those consultations and shall continue to work with local authorities to make certain that targeting works more effectively than in the past. We shall publish the results of those discussions because they will be needed if local authorities are to understand how the system will work and take advantage of the information about the subsidy being given to them before Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say when he expects to be able to give more information about how the Government intend to proceed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To keep the historic form of the phrases that I have been using, I hope that we will be able to announce the form of the subsidy by mid-summer and its figure by Christmas. First, that will give local authorities

plenty of time to hold discussions with us before mid-summer and, secondly, it will give them reasonable time to study the details and figures of the system so that they may organise themselves.</span></p>

CALCULATION OF HOUSING REVENUE ACCOUNT SUBSIDY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 533, in page 71, line 8, after 'determine', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and shall be notified to the local housing authority by 31st October in the financial year preceding that for which the calculation of subsidy is made'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 449, in page 71, line 8, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The Secretary of State shall notify each local housing authority of its estimated entitlement to Housing Revenue Account subsidy (if any) at least three months before the commencement of each financial year, and such an authority shall have the right to make representations about the level of subsidy so notified.'</p></blockquote>
No. 385, in page 71, line 25, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3AA) The Secretary of State shall determine any variations in the formulae relating to the levels of rents or the amount of management or maintenance expenditure in respect of all local housing authorities or descriptions of such authorities at least four months before the beginning of the year to which such determination relates.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to ensure that local authorities are given adequate warning of the amount of housing subsidy that will be payable to them. That notice will enable them to plan and make representations if they are not satisfied with the subsidy which they are to receive.<br><br>
At present, local authorities regularly complain that financial information and determinations from the Government are late or delayed and that that is causing problems for them when undertaking their duties under the various Acts that must be implemented. It would inhibit effective budgeting and forecasting if any organisation did not receive information of that nature in adequate time. That is no less so for a local authority than for any business operating under similar difficulties.<br><br>
The Government consultation paper, "A New Financial Regime for Local Authority Housing in England and Wales", constantly stresses that local authorities should be managed with reasonable efficiency. There is no way that that can be achieved if information is not provided to the local authorities in good time so that they can undertake their duties efficiently and with a proper management grasp of what is going on. No local authority can meet those criteria without sufficient notice of the HRA subsidy that it will receive. My amendment would ensure that information was given to local authorities in good time to make the calculations required by clause 65 and to make any necessary representations.<br><br>
The Minister has a plethora of opportunities before him, since each amendment offers a slightly different timescale under which that could take place. As I read it, the Labour amendment is the least generous—which perhaps makes a change. Nevertheless, the Minister has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 914</span>
various options from which to choose, and I notice that the general intention of these amendments is supported by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister may point out that under the present system determinations for notional elements of management and maintenance costs and rent income need not be made until the 31 March preceding each financial year. Under the new system, greater notice will be required to enable local authorities to perform their duties properly—especially meeting the requirement that their housing revenue accounts should not go into deficit. That will require particularly accurate budgeting if they are to make the best use of the resources available to them and comply with the Act.<br><br>
It should remain possible for local authorities to make advance claims for subsidy based on their own estimates of capital costs and stock levels. It should not be left to the Secretary of State to make arbitrary decisions at short notice on the level of subsidy. If the Government require efficient management, as I have said, they should match that efficiency, with early warning of their decisions and plenty of time for proper consultation. I look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 385. As the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) explained, there is a range of selection available to the Minister about the length of notice which he gives local authorities. The SLD has suggested five months, Labour three months. My amendment suggests four months, as I am a man of moderation. That timescale is supported by the Association of District Councils.<br><br>
As I understand it, all that these amendments do is to write into the Bill what my hon. Friend has promised in consultation. I refer to a note issued by the Department of the Environment on 20 October 1988. Paragraph 10 of that note stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government intends to announce individual authorities' subsidy entitlements together with the formulae on which they are based before Christmas each year to leave plenty of time for the budget making process."</p></blockquote>
When we were talking earlier about the impact of Government decisions on the rates, as opposed to rents, the Government made it clear that local authorities needed time. The Government said that they would do all that they could to ensure that any delay was not the fault of the DOE but was due to genuine consultation.<br><br>
Of course, the figures are needed not only to fix the rate; the tenants, who have an interest in the Government's decision, have to be told. Local authorities now have to consult tenants about rent rises and then give them notice. In the past there has been slippage, because determinations have not been made under the present subsidy system as promptly as they should have been. The unsatisfactory result has been that authorities have had to work on the basis of figures given at consultation. We seek to pin down the Government by putting into statute what I believe the Government intend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am almost tempted to withdraw the amendment, leaving the Minister with the option of four or five months. Amendment No. 449 argues for three months. One point has not been emphasised: under the new regime the housing revenue account should not go into deficit. That will be difficult if there is no leeway for discussion. In the past, noises have been made about local authorities being consulted, and that if the level of subsidy or rate support grant was not sufficient, the local authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0924">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 915</span>
could make representations directly to the Department. For the Minister to organise an effective programme—predictably, many authorities will want to make representations—time must be available for arrangements to be made.<br><br>
It would be more than acceptable if the Minister urged us to withdraw the amendment because three months was not long enough, but said that he would accept one of the other two amendments. It is plain that local authorities need time to make their representations, to put the accounts together properly and to comply with the new regime, which will insist that the housing revenue account does not go into deficit. Authorities will be in real difficulties if the Minister says that there is no room for an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is much between the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and myself on this. He and other members of the Committee may have heard my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government say that it should be possible on all occasions to give notifications of the new housing subsidy by Christmas. So we could comply with the spirit of amendment No. 449. But I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, so that we can accept its spirit in another form.<br><br>
I agree that local authorities would require time to make representations. They will also require time in the early stages, because the new housing subsidy introduced by the Bill is rather complicated, although we consider it to be a fairer system. With that undertaking, I hope that the SLDP and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) will withdraw their amendments and that the hon. Member for Leeds, West will take my undertaking at face value. I shall come back on Report with a similar amendment, which I hope will be satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister said, I regret that the Labour party put forward the three-month option which the Minister has decisively plumped for, as it is the least generous. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 534, in page 71, line 8, at end insert—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the annual loss of subsidy to an authority is not extreme. I hope that there will be common agreement that there is some risk of penal increases as a result of sharp losses of subsidy. The amendment seeks to solve that problem.<br><br>
A number of authorities make substantial contributions from their general rate funds to their housing revenue accounts to keep rents down. When this Act comes into operation such an option will not be available, and the Government will thus be able to manipulate rent levels by extreme variations in subsidy. A complete loss of subsidy to some urban authorities—which is not impossible—would cause rent increases of between £10 and £25 per week, or up to 125 per cent. or more. The amendment will limit such increases.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be briefed, but I wish that those who brief him had taken into account the assurances about rent levels that we gave the Committee on Tuesday and Thursday of last week. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting the possibility of extreme increases, but in our major debate last Thursday morning we said that they would not arise, and that we intend to take rent levels from their present level and from their level when the legislation comes into operation. So what the hon. Gentleman suggests is precisely what we seek to avoid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the Minister's reassurances, but the amendment would write protection for tenants into the Bill. We are interested not only in the starting point; the powers within the Bill would allow future Secretaries of State, through changes in support, effectively to vary rents between local authorities. We are not against changes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0925">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 917</span>
decided upon by local authorities; tenants have votes and can express their opinions. We seek to protect tenants from the use of the Secretary of State's powers in the Bill.<br><br>
I am not suggesting that the increases will necessarily occur, and I am pleased to hear the Minister reiterate his assurances, but they are not the same as having in the Bill the protection that the amendment seeks.<br><br>
If the Minister believes what he is saying—that there should not be extreme variations—there is no reason for him to reject the amendment, or, if the amendment is technically deficient, to reject its spirit. If our formula is not acceptable I hope that he will consider incorporating changes that will accept the intent of the amendment.<br><br>
The amendment requires only that if the Secretary of State feels that rents in some areas are artificially low and should rise—for the reasons that Ministers have given us, including effects on private sector letting, on the revenue of the local authority and on the ratepayers—there should be a ceiling on the maximum amount of subsidy reduction and thus on rent increases resulting therefrom.<br><br>
The Bill will lead to anxiety among local authority tenants, who will not necessarily take all that the Minister has said as gospel. They may feel that another Minister would take a different attitude and have different assumptions about what tenants can afford. Tenants would like to see the protection offered by the amendment written into the Bill so that they can feel that no distant Secretary of State, in an office far away in Whitehall, will be able to manipulate their rents and thus seriously affect their standards of living and ability to pay their way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) closely. He referred to the manipulation of rents by the Secretary of State. How does he see the manipulation of rents by rent officers, with their new duties?<br><br>
How will the Minister calculate the base when rent officers decide rent levels—whether from a new base or the old base? Subsidies may also be affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, and perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee how he anticipates—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). He should not respond to the intervention by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), because he has screwed the matter up. Rent officers deal with rents in the private sector, but we are discussing the public sector, as is the hon. Member for Truro. Rent assessment officers will have to comply with the 1988 legislation concerning the movement of rents from present levels to market levels. That is not relevant to the public housing sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see a separate debate developing, in which I am not directly involved, and I would be called to order, Sir Anthony, if I pursued it.<br><br>
I shall return to the precise effect on local authority housing and rent levels of changes in subsidy. The Minister agrees that the potential for change exists, and accepts that it is in the Bill. He offered some assurance on his intentions and support and about the base levels that will be used. I do not doubt the Minister, but I doubt the powers in the Bill and I fear the ability of a future Secretary of State to alter rent levels. The amendment would simply provide in law the protection that the Minister provided in his assurance to the Committee. I always prefer to give tenants
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 918</span>
protection in law rather than relying on the word of a Conservative Minister. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) may have believed that our proposed amendments to the previous clause were not sufficiently far-reaching—we aimed for a compromise that we hoped the Minister would be able to accept. I must reciprocate his comments now, because amendment No. 534 would weaken our case on the transition to the new housing rent account system.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 452 is to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot include the rent rebate subsidy element in the housing revenue account subsidy. Amendment No. 453 would ensure that local authorities are not penalised for going into the new housing revenue account. Amendment No. 454 is designed to protect local authorities which have used the non-prescribed portion of their capital receipts for capital repairs. Amendment No. 567 is intended to improve the transitional arrangements to which the Minister referred and which we discussed last week. Our suggestion is that they should be strengthened by using the highest contributions made by local authorities from their general funds during the previous four financial years. A clear guideline would then be in the Bill.<br><br>
It may be worth reminding ourselves that the Minister said earlier that the existing law on housing subsidy to local authorities is the Housing Act 1985, but that was a consolidating Act. The present system goes back to the Housing Act 1980, which was the first in a series of Acts incorporating the Government's approach to housing. Housing subsidy exists to help to meet local authorities' costs on their housing revenue accounts. The Minister said that he wishes to help authorities according to their needs, not their means. He accepted that needs vary in different parts of the country and that the system will be uneven in practice. It is not good enough simply to have an across-the-board system. Surely the point of the subsidy was to ensure that when, for historical reasons, there was an unequal distribution of resources, such areas were given support.<br><br>
At present, most authorities do not receive housing subsidies. Since 1980, the Exchequer subsidy has fallen. It fell from £1,250 million in 1978–79 to just £496 million in 1988–89. There has been a massive reduction in the subsidy as well as a reduction in the number of authorities receiving it. Rents have risen by more than inflation. The income from rents has increased unfairly because those rents are out of line with inflation.<br><br>
There is a further reason for the massive—the word is not an exaggeration in this context—reduction in the housing investment programme. My local authority asked for about £70 million but was given only £22 million. It causes great difficulties when local authorities are given only a quarter of what they need to keep their programmes going. Local authority housing capital programme have been reduced by 75 per cent., resulting in a compounded back-log of work.<br><br>
The Government accept that the present system is muddled and inconsistent and it is incumbent on the Government to get it right. If they decide to tear up the present system, they should pay attention to the details, so that they do not find in, say, five years' time, that new system, too, is muddled and inconsistent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0926">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 919</span>
Amendment No. 452 specifies the matters that the Secretary of State would consider when calculating entitlement to the housing revenue account subsidy. He would examine the prices and earnings indices. Local authorities' costs for the financing, management and maintenance and condition of their housing stock must be examined. Our amendment would minimise the impact of rent increases to a level that is relevant to local authority tenants and which would take into account the costs for improving the condition of the stock.<br><br>
In my local authority area, 17,500 houses are stucturally defective. Many of them were built because of coercion be central Government. Local authorities were offered an increase in their housing investment programmes if they accepted certain types of building. If they agreed to accept those packages, they could have their required number of houses. There was pressure to build as many houses as possible. However, the legacy is that system-build structures have proved defective. The Government acknowledged that, and we now have the Housing Defects Act 1984. The principle has been accepted by the Government, but we must consider the scale of the problem.<br><br>
In Leeds, 17,500 houses are defective. They are not all in the public sector, because the right to buy has been exercised. People are stuck with those homes because they cannot sell on. If they live in a two-bedroomed house and want a larger one or want to move to another area, they cannot. They must await the day when the local authority is given a grant for its housing investment programme to enable it to spend the money on improving those houses. I shall not deal with that fully now, as I am sure that we shall return to it later in our proceedings.<br><br>
When the Government recently made an announcement about special resources, Leeds applied for £2 million. I concede that Leeds received a substantial amount compared with other authorities. It received £400,000 for defective housing improvement work. But let us work out the cost of improving each house. If it costs £20,000 to improve an Airey house—or £12,000, in some cases—those resources would cover a pitiful number of houses in relation to the scale of the problem. People will be asked to wait 40 years before their homes can be improved.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that, during the last financial year, renovations, modifications and the redecoration of No. 10 Downing street amounted to about £907,000? It seems that one specific tenant can get all the necessary repair jobs done to that property as quickly as possible and at great expense to the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reminding me of that. That injustice should be highlighted when tenants realise that they must wait so long for repairs to their property, and that what little resources there are must be shared among so many. Great expenditure is undertaken elsewhere without the critical scrutiny and reference back to the Department of the Environment that local authorities must undergo.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. I asked the Department of the Environment how the money would be spent, as it was public money, but unfortunately it declined
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 920</span>
to answer me. So we do not know how much the Prime Minister spent on flock wallpaper or other items in No. 10 Downing street. As local authorities are subjected to severe scrutiny of the money that they spend on repairs to basic amenities in council houses, the same rule should apply to the tenant of No. 10 Downing street.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The discrepancy is more than apparent, and my hon. Friend has done commendable work in exposing it. Hopefully, that will be noted, and tenants can make the obvious comparison. I compliment my hon. Friend on eliciting at least some information from the questions that he has assiduously pursued.<br><br>
I now wish to comment on amendment No. 453—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed with interest my hon. Friend's point about the influence that subsidies could have on the financing of capital expenditure and the condition of housing stock, and his suggestion that housing subsidies should take that into consideration. Will he consider the effect that the Government's policy on the ring-fencing of housing revenue accounts will have on the level of rent? That could also require further consideration of housing subsidies, because the ring-fencing system will have a devastating effect on the level of rents. I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to clarify that point, so that the Minister can respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I need to, as my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) has spelt out the position accurately. I refer to amendment No. 453, which ties in with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West. It would delete from the clause the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3) above, a formula for the year beginning 1st April 1990 may include variables the values of which fall to be determined on the basis of information received by the Secretary of State on or before 27th July 1988."</p></blockquote>
When I read the provision, I wondered why we need the Audit Commission, about whose existence the Minister so readily leapt up and reminded my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton. If the Audit Commission is to police local authorities, why are these words necessary?<br><br>
If the Audit Commission ensures that no untoward practices are adopted to increase subsidy entitlement, why does the Minister need back-up power? Has he no confidence in the ability of the Audit Commission to manage the situation and keep an eye on local authorities? Does he not believe—a more trenchant point—that local authorities will follow the code of practice and not try to outstep the guidelines?<br><br>
The clause is included to prevent local authorities from manipulating their entitlement to housing revenue account subsidy, once the consultation paper has been published. It could lead, however, to unfair treatment of local authorities whose accountancy practices may legitimately change over time. If the subsection remains, the Secretary of State will retain the power to make the decision.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton noted when he referred to ring-fencing, the Government have taken the power wholly to manage, control and reduce the housing investment programme, and now intends to move in on the housing revenue account. They will close every door to ensure that they have total control of that account. It will not be good enough for local authorities to suggest that their accounting practices were cleared by the Audit Commission. The Government want the back-up power to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 921</span>
ensure that that account comes out as they wish, rather than in accordance with the local authority's assessment of its needs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another factor was demonstrated by the Minister. He said that another agent, the district auditor, was working on behalf of the Department of the Environment. We were told that the district auditor will monitor the housing revenue account and the housing repair account. The Minister for Local Government sang the praises of the Wakefield authority, of which I was formerly a member, and admitted that it is well-run. As there are accounting officers—whom the Minister considers praiseworthy—and the district auditor, why do we need this subsection?<br><br>
I support my colleague's argument. When the Minister replies to him, will he explain why further legislation is needed, when all these agents are monitoring the housing revenue account?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is for the Minister to answer. He must make it clear that he does not want total control of the housing revenue account, and that he intends to leave some leeway for the auditors and the Audit Commission. He must show that he has confidence in the ability of local authorities to manage their affairs. The detail of the Bill suggests that the Government have no such confidence. If that is the Minister's view, he should state it plainly, instead of trying to build into the law powers that enable him to manipulate the account in the background, without accountability or check.<br><br>
Amendment No. 453 attempts to ensure that local authorities are not managed in the background by the Minister and the DoE, and that the HRA bears some relation to accounting practices, which may perfectly legitimately change at local level.<br><br>
Amendment No. 454 is designed to defend local authorities that have used the non-prescribed portion of their capital receipts to fund capital repairs. District auditors had in the past to determine whether that was a legitimate area of activity. The answer was yes—it was always perfectly legal. Under the 1980 Act, local authorities can use the non-prescribed portion of their capital receipts to fund certain major repairs—known as capitalised repairs—and that has kept down revenue spending.<br><br>
Part IV will stop that, and unless a compensatory increase is made through subsidy—through management and maintenance allowances—major cuts will have to be made in the repairs programmes. Prior-to-painting and painting programmes are already years behind, with obvious effects on the four-to-five-year cycle. What happens when that cycle is lost? If the prior-to-painting stage is omitted and if painting schemes are not carried out regularly, the paint peels off, the weather gets at the wood, and it becomes more likely that window frames will need to be renewed, which is unnecessary if programmed repairs are carried out.<br><br>
We have argued for programmed repairs for some time, but the Bill will undermine them even further. It will result in programmes with longer cycles—of seven instead of five years—and there will be a backlog of damage that will have to be dealt with by someone at some stage. We cannot keep deferring the maintenance and upkeep of housing stock. We seem not always to realise that housing is a finite resource that needs regular renewal, improvement and repair. If a house is left alone, it does not remain in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 922</span>
same condition; it starts to fall down. By making the use of capitalised receipts illegal, the Bill will make the programme fall further behind, and the housing stock will deteriorate.<br><br>
To compensate for past cuts in the housing investment programme, many local authorities have used capital receipts for major repairs programmes. Ministers have said that they want more repairs carried out to council housing. That is what local authorities have done. All has been perfectly legal, and, latterly, Ministers have started to make a virtue of it. As recently as March, during the Government's announcement about their change of mind on the housing action trusts, the Department of the Environment's press release applauded the level of housing programme repairs in the borough of Lambeth, some of which was funded through capitalised receipts, so there is no harm in doing it.<br><br>
If the Minister accepts that, can he assure us that he will not undermine the practice and that he will accept amendment No. 454? If he cannot accept it because of its wording, will he be generous enough to say that, if I withdraw it, he will table an appropriate amendment on Report that we can all support?<br><br>
Amendment No. 567 is an attempt to sharpen the transitional arrangements, because the method of calculation that is proposed by the Department of the Environment will penalise local authorities. We suggest that the use of:
<br><blockquote><p>"the highest of the actual contributions made by the local authority from its General Fund in the previous four financial years"</p></blockquote>
provides a more accurate figure for determining the local authority's needs. Clause 69 contains the concept of the new housing revenue account subsidy and the factors that the Secretary of State may take into account in determining the formula for distributing the new support. The consultation paper, the "New Financial Regime for Local Authority Housing in England and Wales", published last July, accepted that transitional arrangements would be needed to prevent large increases resulting from the new ring-fence arrangements, and I think that the Minister accepted that this morning. A transitional arrangement is needed, and the Minister has said that that is what we shall have.<br><br>
However, we need to know more about the mechanics and details of the proposal. If it involves what might be called an assessed control total for an additional housing revenue account subsidy to be distributed between housing authorities, on the basis of the average of their rate fund contributions for 1986–87 and 1987–88, and their estimated rate fund contributions for 1989, that could lead to gross inequalities between authorities. The Department of the Environment may wish to use that system and deprive authorities of any incentive to manipulate the rate fund contribution to increase subsidy entitlements.<br><br>
The Department seems to be obsessed with that total control mechanism, but it has drawbacks. First, rents are set on the basis of estimates of income and expenditure, so that the use of totals for the financial year 1986–87 and 1987–88 may unfairly depress subsidy entitlements in some authorities.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Secondly, and perhaps most important, rate fund contributions have tended to increase as a result of reductions in the housing subsidy to which I referred earlier. It seems quite likely that the rate fund contributon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0928">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 923</span>
for 1989–90 will be higher than that for 1988–89. In some authorities, I think that that will mean quite a fierce reduction, which in turn will mean a fierce rent increase.<br><br>
The purpose of our amendment is to sharpen up that transitional arrangement by ensuring that the additional subsidy, equivalent to the highest rate fund contribution made during the past four years—since 1986–87—is the base figure, and that that is made available rather than just the average.<br><br>
The Government seem obsessed with calculations based on averages. Whenever we hear discussions of the benefit system, we are referred to the average wage. When recently, we were talking about child benefit, we were informed that two thirds of the people who received it were on an above average wage, which is palpably not true. All it suggests is that some people are on very high wages. If we always go by the average, people at the bottom end of the figures from which the average is drawn are penalised.<br><br>
Amendment No. 567 proposes a more equitable system on which to base the transitional arrangements, and I hope that the Minister will find it acceptable and say that he will not go down the line suggested by the methodology of the Department of the Environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly to amendment No. 383. The Minister has enormous powers under clause 69 to decide how much housing revenue account subsidy to give a local housing authority. These amendments, which have the support of the Association of District Councils, put parameters around that discretion and try to put into the Bill the sort of criteria which I think the Minister will follow anyway and those that seem sensible to me.<br><br>
Subparagraph (i) of the amendment asks the Secretary of State to take the affordability of rents charged to those in low-paid employment into account when determining subsidy. That is what Ministers said they would do when what became the Housing Act 1988 went through Parliament in respect of housing association tenants. Part of the Government's strategy, of course, is to introduce a level playing field between housing association tenants and local authority tenants. Given that they want housing association rents to be fixed at a level which takes account of the ability of people in low-paid employment to pay them, it seems logical to extend the same criteria to local authority tenants.<br><br>
Subparagraph (ii) of the amendment brings the income level of council tenants into account. In the past, the Department has taken into account average earnings, and the amendment seeks to put that in the Bill, but instead of average earnings it suggests that income levels of council tenants are the ones to go for, as of course it is they who will pay the increased rents, not the community as a whole.<br><br>
Subparagraph (iii), which again should not be controversial, is designed to take account of inflation. The Department also takes that into account at present.<br><br>
Subparagraph (iv) is intended simply to avoid too big a jump in rents due to a change in subsidy. The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said that the Department was aware that, if it moved too fast, there would be a jump in rents, and he made it quite clear that that was not the Government's policy. There should not be too much argument about subsection (iv).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 924</span>
Paragraph (b) of the amendment seeks to ensure a level playing field for housing associations and local authorities. If it is to be secured, the Secretary of State will find it necessary to allow the increase referred to for management and maintenance by housing associations. They spend slightly more than local authorities and there should be parity of treatment.<br><br>
We do not want to restrict the Secretary of State's legitimate discretion but there should be parameters to that otherwise unfettered discretion. My hon. Friend would exercise it sensibly, but others may not. I hope, therefore, that the Government will smile on amendment No. 383.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 543, which has been tabled on behalf of the Institute of Housing, to which I am a consultant.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to give authorities a financial incentive to provide transferable discounts, thus freeing local authority property and reducing the amount and cost of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. That is also the Government's objective.<br><br>
Section 129 of the Housing Act 1988 enables local housing authorities to make schemes under which, if approved by the Secretary of State, they can give grants to qualifying tenants or licensees to enable them to buy or improve property in the private sector for use as alternative accommodation.<br><br>
Grants made under the transferable discount scheme are treated as prescribed capital expenditure, but debited to the housing revenue account as management expenditure. They do not entitle the housing authority to any housing revenue account subsidy. In my opinion, and that of the Institute of Housing, the anomaly of capital expenditure counting as a management cost must be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin my response to an interesting debate by tackling head on the question asked by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle): whether the Government, the Department of the Environment, the Secretary of State or any of his junior Ministers wish to have complete control of the housing revenue account. The answer is no, we do not.<br><br>
At a previous sitting, I gave the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we wanted local authorities to be responsible for bringing the equation into balance. It is the Secretary of State's responsibility to ensure that the HRA is ring-fenced and continues to do so. That is enshrined in the legislation. The hon. Gentleman is trying to evince from me the assertion that local authorities should have responsibility for bringing the equation into balance, and I hope that he will welcome my assurance that that will be so.<br><br>
I shall respond to the amendments in the order in which they appear on the amendment paper. I intervened in the speech made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) and said that the HRA subsidy, like the existing main housing subsidy, will be incremental. The starting point for each year's calculation will be the previous year's subsidy. Therefore, for the first year of the new system, the calculation of HRA subsidy will start from the previous year's main housing subsidy. The hon. Gentleman did not appear to understand what I said in my intervention. He assumed that it would start from exactly the same position on a new basis each year, but it will not.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0929">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 925</span>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West is becoming more familiar with the legislation. That is dreadful. God forbid that the Opposition should understand what they are talking about in relation to housing. We were hoping to get past this clause before the hon. Gentleman latched on to what was in the HRA, but he is gathering the information as he goes along. I must correct him on one or two things, however.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks of people understanding the Bill. This morning, the Minister for Local Government had to tell the Committee that the Government do not understand clause 65 and have had to introduce a new clause. If anyone does not understand the Bill, it is the Government, not the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the Opposition's gift horses. My right hon. Friend did not say that he did not understand the clause. He said that he had met the Opposition's anxieties in as many regards as possible. As a listening and caring Minister who is here to help, he was anxious to pick up the points raised in previous sittings. Of course my right hon. Friend understood the provision. There is a great advantage on the Government side in that we are able to understand such matters. I detect that the hon. Member for Leeds, West is increasing his knowledge daily.<br><br>
I return to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Truro. If subsidy were calculated from scratch, year on year, there might be some point to his amendment, but it does not work like that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West fastened on to what happens if, at the end of a year, the equation does not balance—income from the new housing subsidy to which he correctly referred does not match what is within the ring-fence of the HRA. If there is a deficit, the Department of the Environment will not wipe off that deficit. The hon. Gentleman seems to understand that, the following year, the local authority would start with that deficit. I hope that I can carry the majority of the Committee with me on that point because it opens up an entirely new world. That is one reason why I shall ask the Committee to reject the hon. Gentleman's amendment.<br><br>
With the incremental system, changes in credits and debits to the account that are beyond the authority's control—such as interest rates and the volume of rent rebates—will be reflected in the subsidy entitlement. In that respect, the amendment is counterproductive and could adversely affect local authorities in certain circumstances.<br><br>
The amendment would also have a perverse effect. An authority's subsidy entitlement might fall by more than 10 per cent. of rents because other items of income had increased, or other items of expenditure had decreased, by more than that amount. For instance, the sale of 20 per cent. of the stock would produce a new stream of income from the interest or the capital receipts set aside to reduce debt. It would also reduce the amount of management and maintenance spending. That could be changed within the space of one government year and could mean that the whole housing financing regime within a local authority could change dramatically. In that case, the authority would no longer need the same amount of subsidy as before. The amendment would leave the authority with subsidy that it no longer required and which could have been directed to other authorities with greater needs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 926</span>
In the first year of the new system, we shall need to make an adjustment to replace the rate fund contributions into the HRA, or the transfers out of the HRA, that authorities have been in the practice of making. It will not be easy to make an accurate assessment of the size of the adjustments required, so we shall soon consult local authority representatives about that. That was the precise point raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, West, and I think that he was right. We have to consider that more carefully and I understand what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
What approach is adopted, it could not be less satisfactory than amendment No. 567, which would require the adjustment to be based on the highest rate fund contribution made over the previous four years. Many authorities vary the contribution that they make each year. Some make transfers sporadically—one large transfer, and smaller amounts for the next few years. The amendment would not allow us to look at overall trends or averages. It would tie the adjustment to a single contribution—not surprisingly, the highest—irrespective of whether it was appropriate. We intend to get much closer than that to the real position. None the less, I accept the spirit of what the hon. Member for Leeds, West said.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It is clear that, to avoid distortions, we need to rely upon information which was provided to us before the consultation paper was issued on 27 July last year. Without it, we would be offering an open invitation to local authorities to—dare I say it—doctor their accounts or modify their behaviour between now and 1 April 1990 to maximise their entitlement to subsidy. That would be an unfortunate inducement to manipulation while authorities—the vast majority—which played the game would be penalised. That would be the effect of amendment No. 453. I hope that the Committee will agree that it would be a perverse effect.<br><br>
As a result of that adjustment rate fund contributions that were made in the past would be replaced by rate fund subsidies and, because each year's subsidy is the starting point for the calculation of next year's, the effect of the contributions would persist for as long as needed. The large rate fund contributions that may be required to meet high management and maintenance costs are, as the hon. Member for Leeds, West knows, an important segment of the ring-fence. If they are paid simply to hold down rents at ratepayers' expense, they will be squeezed out progressively. That goes back to the basic principles of stopping the general rate fund making a contribution to the housing revenue account.<br><br>
Amendment 454 provides for a further adjustment to be made in the subsidy determinations for the first year. The effect would be that where authorities have used their capital receipts for non-prescribed expenditure on capitalised repairs, this spending would be reflected in future subsidy settlements. There are many difficulties inherentin this proposition. First, much of the non-prescribed expenditure that has been undertaken is properly regarded as capital spending, the need for which should be reflected in capital allowances, not in subsidy. We do not know how much; we are short of information on non-prescribed capital spending. Spending of this kind is erratic. An authority may do much one year and virtually none the next. Finding an equitable way of reflecting past practices in subsidy would not be easy. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0930">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 927</span>
could be argued that when receipts have been spent, for whatever purpose, authorities which have spent have no right to expect to have their cake and eat it.<br><br>
I recognise that there is a real problem here, particularly for authorities which have relied upon non-prescribed capital expenditure from receipts to provide a legitimate boost to their repairs programme over a number of years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My local authority has a successful direct labour organisation which makes a considerable surplus during the financial year. That is what the Government have recommended for local authorities and my authority has gone along with Government policy in this respect. It has had much success with its DLO for new build and repairs, as has the architect's department.<br><br>
In the past, direct labour organisation profit has sometimes been put into the housing revenue account as a form of subsidy to carry out further repairs or to keep down rents. How will that arrangement be affected by the Bill? I am not sure whether it will be accounted for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is accounted for in so far as it is outside the ring-fence, so it need not concern us on this clause.<br><br>
There is a real problem here, particularly for authorities that have relied on non-prescribed capital expenditure from receipts to provide a legitimate boost to their repairs programme over a number of years. Whether and how to reflect this in subsidy is a matter that I shall want my Department to discuss further with the local authority associations.<br><br>
For now, may I simply state that the effect of the amendment can be achieved under clause 69 (1), (2) and (3), and that I have noted that the point needs further attention.<br><br>
We now come to the heart of the formula—the allowances made for rent increases and for increases in the costs of management and maintenance. These will be the subject of detailed formulae to be devised each year, which will themselves be the subject of prior consultation. The Committee has already discussed the rents formula, which I developed at some length last Thursday morning.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 452 and 383, attempt to state in rather more detail than the Bill gives the factors that the Secretary of State should take into account. Amendment No. 454 is, incidentally, defective. I suspect that the words, "as he thinks fit", or something like that, have been omitted. That apart, however, there are other respects in which the amendment is either unnecessary or undesirable.<br><br>
Movements in prices and earnings—in other words, inflation—will be taken into account under subsection (3)(a) as part of the assumptions that the Secretary of State makes about credits and debits to be made to the account. Movements in the cost of financing capital expenditure, such as changes in interest rates, or in the rules governing the repayment of debt, will certainly be fully reflected in subsidy entitlement. Loan charges on new borrowing will also be fully reflected in subsidy so long as the rules on admissible costs are complied with.<br><br>
Here the arrangements become rather tricky. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) has considerable experience of the work of the Department of the Environment, espcially housing, and he will know that there must be a notional calculation.<br><br>
A notional assessment of management and maintenance costs will be part of each year's subsidy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 928</span>
calculation. If we used the actual figure, as the amendment suggests, we would be offering local authorities carte blache to incur what costs they like, whereas under our notional assessments an authority will have to balance its management and maintenance costs against its rents, and account to its tenants for how efficiently it does so. Amendment No. 383 would tie the management and maintenance determination in some way to the management and maintenance spending of housing associations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was right to say that Professor Maclennan's report suggested that management and maintenance costs were higher for housing associations than for local authorities, and that in the main rents were also higher. I hope that the Committee has followed my argument on the equation. There must be a notional charge for management and maintenance. No one is suggesting that calculating that cost will be easy, but we must arrive at it before the Bill is enacted. That information is important as it will allow a local authority to determine the rent levels it should set to bring the equation into balance.<br><br>
We intend that the new management and maintenance assessments will be better targeted than under the present broad-brush system. To return to a point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, West, there will be a darn sight fairer distribution nationwide, especially in the midlands and the north, than hitherto. We hope to be able to take more account of the circumstances of local authorities and I cannot see how bringing housing associations into the picture would help that assessment.<br><br>
The condition of the stock is not properly a consideration here. Where expenditure is needed on the condition of the stock, it will, by definition, be capital expenditure and should be reflected in capital allocations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I heard the Minister correctly but there seems to be confusion because maintenance is included in the equation. Is he saying that repairs of the kind that he may have had in mind when I referred to painting programmes will not be regarded as maintenance but as capital repairs? If so, quite a lot will be taken out of the equation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, to repeat what I said last week, there are three composite parts of the ring-fence of the HRA. There is management and maintenance of existing stock. Money which can be provided by way of capital receipts is a separate issue. That could mean that, after 75 per cent. of the contributions from the capital receipts drawn down by right-to-buy sales is taken into account, 25 per cent. can be spent in any way, shape or form and that would be outside the ring-fencing of HRA. It is important to remind the Committee that we are talking about revenue and we should not mix it up with capital.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton mentions tenants. It would require the Secretary of State to have regard to tenants' incomes, movement in prices and incomes and the financial impact of determination on tenants. My hon. Friend will understand the extreme difficulty that we face in the Department is whether we should assess how much should be paid in rent in the public sector. We have studiously avoided such a prediction. With his experience, my hon. Friend will know that those in the housing association movement are not so modest. From memory, I believe that they consider that 20 per cent. of average income is a fair
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0931">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 929</span>
contribution to rent. I hope that I have accepted the spirit of my hon. Friend's comments, but relating that view to tenants in the public housing sector means 20 per cent. of average manual workers' income. I represent a northern constituency and each time I see the figures of average income that are published monthly, I am staggered.<br><br>
I accept that all those considerations would need to be taken into the calculation of what we term the new housing subsidy. My hon. Friend's amendment seeks to tie the rent of all council tenants to the levels which could be afforded by those in low-paid employment. If we are not careful, we shall return to the debate of last week about what is affordable and how "affordable" is defined. Such a debate would not be useful.<br><br>
I spoke earlier about the damage that is caused by council rents that are pitched at poorer tenants. It is surely more sensible when setting rents to allow those who can afford to do so to pay a fairer price, reflecting the value of their property, and to target rent rebates at those who need them. That is the purpose of the rent rebate system. Why give windfall gains to all council tenants? I assure my hon. Friend that the financial circumstances of tenants and the impact of the new rent levels would be a consideration.<br><br>
We certainly do not want rent levels to move beyond the reach of council tenants. But any form of artificial cap would be arbitrary and might be extremely damaging. We are not planning to use clause 69 in a way that is insensitive to the consequences for tenants. With that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 543 covers a small anomaly in the existing legislation which I agree needs further thought. Section 129 grants are paid by local authorities to tenants and count as capital expenditure, but are charged directly to the housing revenue account. Under the existing system, that has had little practical effect, but with the advent of the ring-fence, authorities may be discouraged from continuing to pay the grants unless they are compensated for doing so. That is presumably the purpose of the amendment, and I understand what my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton said about it. I am prepared to accept the spirit of what he said, if he will accept the spirit of what I am saying. If he will withdraw his amendment, I shall table on Report an amendment to meet the spirit of his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for what he said. I apologise for not having heard the first part of his reply to my amendment—I was outside the Room discussing another amendment with another Minister. I accept that my hon. Friend cares as much about this area of policy as the Institute of Housing and I do, and I shall not press the amendment at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the way in which the Minister responded to this group of amendments, which goes to the core of this part of the Bill, and the fact that he agreed to consult local authorities on the working of the transitional arrangements. We look forward to successful progress in those negotiations.<br><br>
However, the Minister has made life harder for himself because of what is included in the ring-fence. On one side, rent rebates have been included with the cost of management, maintenance, debt repayment and so on.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 930</span>
Balancing that are the rents. Inclusion of the rent rebate system is the rogue variable in the equation, because the housing benefit element will break that equation apart.<br><br>
I am tempted to ask the Minister to state what he includes as daily, weekly, monthly and yearly maintenance, as opposed to capital works. If there is storm damage to roofs, will the repairs be routine maintenance or a major contract job of re-roofing? The cost may be the same. The division between capital and revenue repairs is crucial. If the Minister is saying that as the housing stock declines, more and more major repairs may be necessary because painting and roof repairs have not been carried out, woodwork has not been maintained, and homes need new bathrooms and lavatories, will those costs be part of the daily maintenance programme? If so, the pressure on rents will be massive. The housing investment programmes will decline, but the burden will fall on rents.<br><br>
Tenants will have to pay for full major repairs. No one else has to do that. A person buying a property needing major repairs may negotiate the price, and may get an extended loan; but he would not be expected to pay for it on a daily basis. If we are not careful, the cost of property improvement will become part of the equation.<br><br>
The rogue factor—the rent rebate factor—includes the whole of the housing benefit sector. The housing benefit system for council and other tenants is administered by local authorities for the Department of Social Security. The authorities get part of the money back from central Government. Housing benefit is now to be included in the ring-fenced housing revenue account rather than being included in the income support system. Yet the purpose of the Fowler review was that family credit, income support and housing benefit were to be levelled out with a common test as part of the income support system.<br><br>
By including rent rebates in the equation, the Bill is using the income support system as a means of improving housing. The housing benefit system should be related to people's income, not to improving housing stock. In practice, if private rents rise, housing benefit will have to be paid. The Minister may say that there will be a level—a notional level, because the Minister will then insist that councils do not pay—at which councils could pay. Councils could evict or suggest that tenants move out but they will have to meet increased rents in the private sector.<br><br>
The Minister accepts that the Housing Act 1988 will force up rents in the private sector. If rebates are paid within the ring-fenced housing revenue account, increases in the private sector will be paid from the new housing revenue account. Tenants in council housing who are marginally above housing benefit level because of their circumstances will pay the price; they will be subsidising the increases in rents in the private sector. If private sector rents rise quickly and local authorities have to pay the housing benefit, the pressure will be on the housing revenue account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. It takes us back to a previous debate, when I tried to explain that the taxpayer would fund the new housing subsidy. The hon. Gentleman has forgotten: of course it will be the taxpayer. We would calculate how much money has to be available for the new housing subsidy, which will bring the equation into balance. That money will not come from the ratepayers or the future community charge payers. It will come from the general taxpayer.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might have made life easier for himself and left the costs with the taxpayer, leaving housing benefit as income support, paid in common tax to the Treasury and back through the Department of Social Security. Some of us argued that housing benefit should not be handed over to local authorities because it could become confused with the housing revenue account. That was the reason for our opposition to the introduction of the new system in 1982 and in 1984, when it was implemented. The Minister could, even at this stage, take out the rogue factor, leaving housing benefit where it belongs.<br><br>
The Bill provides the Minister with the power to manage and balance the equation for every local authority. But his hands will be tied by what happens in the Department of Social Security, depending on the level at which income support is set each year. He will have to watch the social security uprating every year like a hawk, because it will affect the housing revenue account of every local authority.<br><br>
Does the Minister want his budget run by the Department of Social Security? His budget ought to enable him to improve housing and to bring this country's housing stock up to modern standards. That is what his job should be; he should not be operating the cuts in the benefit system through the back door of the housing revenue account, as he will be doing as long as the rent rebate system remains within the equation. I hope that the Minister will agree to reopen this debate on Report, as I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote now. Perhaps by Report and Third Reading the Minister will have seen the light and will agree to take the rent rebate out of the equation; it builds in a variable which would be outside his control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I respond briefly to that point? I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for not putting the amendment to a vote, but there is a misunderstanding that I must clear up for the record. The rent rebate part of the equation is the easiest to tackle because it is a known, fixed amount. We know what it is in any given year. When I replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, I was dealing in the notional figure for management and maintenance which we would have to calculate yearly to arrive at the new housing subsidy. The hon. Gentleman may not accept my argument, but if he thinks about it he will realise that we can predict that figure over a 12-month period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the Minister were right and that we could, but just a few weeks ago we were debating housing benefit, which has changed 14 times in fewer than 14 years. If the housing benefit figure fixed in the October upratings is not adhered to, the whole structure of the budget will be damaged. That has happened in the past few years and I see no sign that it will not happen in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a segment within the ring-fence for rent rebates—a form of housing benefit, and the hon. Gentleman understands the difference between the two—and even if rebates vary during the course of the year, they represent, none the less, an actual amount. The transitional arrangements for management and maintenance to which I referred are more difficult, although the hon. Gentleman and I may not agree about that. However, I accept that we must reconsider our definitions of maintenance and capital repair.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 932</span>
A clear line can be drawn between these two functions. For example, I understand what maintaining my house regularly costs, but if the garage were to be blown down I would consider its repair a capital cost and not a part of maintenance. That is a simple example. But, as so often, there is a grey area, and the only way we can deal with it is to discuss it with the local authority associations and come to an agreement with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister's response to my amendment. I was interested to hear his comments on other amendments also. I shall not press my amendment, although I am still worried that the powers exist, even if the intention to use them does not. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 521, in page 71, line 9, leave out from 'is' to 'a' in line 11.—<i>[Mr. Trippier.]</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In this clause, a local authority would be required to transfer any notional negative subsidy to the general rate fund. That is unfair. A local authority should not have to do so unless a negative subsidy actually existed. It would be unjust to be penalised for something which bore no relation to the actual housing revenue account.<br><br>
A notional negative subsidy of say, £500,000 would have to be credited to the general rate fund. In my local authority area, that would probably cost tenants about £1 a week. But if the true position of the housing revenue account revealed a surplus of £250,000, no increase would be needed. Will the Minister clarify that matter?</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we allowed the surpluses to remain with the housing revenue account, they would be available to finance extra expenditure or cushion inefficiency—I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman expects me to say that, but we have touched on it in past debates—whereas they ought to hold rents down by other means. It would have the effect of undermining the aims which the new system is designed to achieve—namely, to stimulate competition among providers of rented housing, to secure comparability among authorities so that tenants can judge their performance, and to make authorities truly accountable to their tenants. Those aims are important, no less to the authorities which are fortunate enough to manage without subsidies than to others. Having said that, I hope that all hon. Members will now support the clause as amended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a reasonable answer. If a local authority must do that simply because of a notional negative housing subsidy, tenants will be penalised for something which is not the local authority's fault or is outside its control. In my local authority area, that could mean about £1 a week. That is ludicrous if it is just to ensure that the Minister has a local authority which is theoretically efficient. The authority could easily be very efficient without having to put this burden on the backs of its tenants. It is totally unfair, and the Minister's answer will not be much comfort to any tenant who has to pay an additional £1 a week simply because the Minister wants to see the system work as it is written down.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 69, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

CONSEQUENTIAL ADJUSTMENT OF RENT REBATE SUBSIDY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 455, in page 71, line 30, leave out subsection (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 456, in page 71, leave out lines 36 to 39 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) In subsection (5)(a) of that section, in sub-paragraph (i) leave out all words after "by reference to Housing Revenue Account rebates.".'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are considering a ragbag of a Bill, and we now come to clause 70, which I consider to be cruel and dishonest. Our amendments are designed to ensure that a separate rent rebate subsidy may continue and be credited to the housing revenue account of a local authority.<br><br>
At present, local authorities receive rent income from tenants net of housing benefit entitlements. The Government reimburse councils accordingly. That mechanism is operated by local authorities in conjunction with the Department of Social Security. Council tenants are treated in the same way as those in the private sector who receive housing benefit from the local authority and then pay landlords the gross rent. We believe that it would be fair to have a separate rent rebate subsidy.<br><br>
Clause 70 refers to the Social Security Act 1986 and says that the words "total housing benefit" should be substituted by the words "relevant benefit". Subsection (3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Every local housing authority shall for each year carry to the credit of their Housing Revenue Account from some other revenue account of theirs which is not a Housing Repairs Account an amount equal to the aggregate of—(a) the cost of administering the Housing Revenue Account rebates granted by them during the year".</p></blockquote>
The other account that is referred to could be the poll tax fund or an account that is contributed to by ratepayers. The poor tenants in council houses could be paying towards the rents of the very poor.<br><br>
It is not only the Opposition who are worried about that. I have a letter dated 7 April from Age Concern which is worried about clause 70. It suggests that the Minister should consider that clause carefully because of its effect on elderly tenants and those on low incomes. Age Concern states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the provision of benefit to elderly people on low incomes should remain the responsibility of the State.".</p></blockquote>
That is the general feeling of many in the country. Those on low incomes will have to subsidise the rents of those on very low incomes.<br><br>
The letter from Age Concern refers to subsidies from central to local government and suggests that that subsidy should be given to the poorer tenants by the council so that poorer tenants need not subsidise those on very low incomes. Age Concern states that local authorities which have a surplus in their housing revenue account will face a reduction in the amount of housing benefit they receive from the Government to give to their tenants. Therefore, the rents of tenants not receiving benefit will subsidise the rent rebate of those who receive benefit. That is clear in the Bill. It is a factor that Age Concern chose to draw to the attention of members of the Committee, because of the serious and cruel effect that it will have on people on low incomes. Age Concern states:
<br><blockquote><p>"When the task of distributing housing benefit was passed to local authorities in 1982 there was no indication that benefit would ever be considered a subsidy."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 934</span>
I have said that the clause is cruel and dishonest. As Age Concern stated, there was no suggestion that housing benefit would be considered a subsidy to people on low incomes. Yet, under the Bill, we now have this twist, this turn, this cruel approach that housing benefit will be classed as a subsidy to tenants.<br><br>
Age Concern continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are around 3 million elderly council tenants. Many are in the poverty trap: modest occupational pension income or savings will disqualify them from receiving benefit, yet they are left with minimal income once they have paid their rent."</p></blockquote>
The clause will mean that people who are just outside the poverty trap will end up in it. That is a further cruel part of the clause.<br><br>
The last paragraph of Age Concern's briefing states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Neither private nor housing association tenants are to be put in this situation, whilst home owners continue to receive large amounts of state subsidy through mortgage interest tax relief."</p></blockquote>
On various occasions, we have referred to the discrepancy in the Government's attitude towards owner-occupiers and council or housing association tenants. To put the record straight, I emphasise that we are not against mortgage interest tax relief to people on low incomes, but there should be an equal application of subsidies to people who are renting properties. The Government discriminate cruelly against council house tenants. Will Conservative Members, especially the Minister, spare a Christian thought to how the subsidies will apply to people in council houses?<br><br>
Members of the Committee will also have received a letter from the Housing Centre Trust, which advises:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Trust is an independent educational charity which works for the improvement of housing in all sectors through the dissemination of information, the exchange of ideas, and the encouragement of good practice. Members of its Council are drawn from the public, private and voluntary sectors and represent a cross-section of housing interest and activity."</p></blockquote>
That is the background of the Housing Centre Trust. It also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has suggested that eventually exchequer subsidies will be withdrawn."</p></blockquote>
The trust envisages that, under the Bill, especially clause 70, Exchequer subsidies will ultimately be withdrawn and that that, in turn, will force
<br><blockquote><p>"council tenants to pay a full rent to provide the funds for the rebates due to other council tenants."</p></blockquote>
It considers that the position is broader than the one to which we referred earlier, but suggests that poor council tenants will pay the rents for the very poor and those on low incomes.<br><br>
The Housing Centre Trust goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Only then, according to the Government, will council tenants be able to make a rational choice of tenure based on its 'real' costs. But they will not have a fair basis for choice of tenure when other tenures do not bear the same burden. It has not been suggested that private tenants on full rent should bear such a charge, and mortgage tax relief will not be withdrawn to allow residents in the private sector to make rational decisions about their housing. A rational choice would be possible only if public subsidy were distributed evenly between all tenures."</p></blockquote>
That hits the kernel of the problem.<br><br>
The amendment is intended to change the Bill so that the rent rebate subsidy will show as a separate subsidy and will continue to be credited separately to the housing revenue account, so will be identified as a contribution from central Government—from taxpayers—rather than as a tax on council tenants.<br><br>

12.45 pm<br><br>
Councils can budget for a deficit on their housing revenue account and make up the difference with a contribution from the general rate fund. Surpluses on the housing revenue account can be transferred the other way, so there is two-way traffic. Contributions can be made to the housing revenue account from the rate fund, or the poll tax fund as it will be after next April. By the same yardstick, surpluses on the housing revenue account can be transferred into the rate fund. Not many authorities contribute to the housing revenue account—that occurs only where the cost of housing is high—and many authorities receive no contribution fom the rate fund. That is not a major problem, but the Government are creating one.<br><br>
The Bill seeks to abolish rate fund contributions. Transfers out of the housing revenue account, after housing benefit payments have been made, will be enforced under the legislation. The Government will decree that surpluses in the housing revenue account must be transferred to the poll tax fund. When subsidies are no longer made to the authorities, that will become discretionary. Many people will have to contribute to the housing revenue account through rent increases, and in many cases those increases will be large.<br><br>
The clause restricts the discretion of local authorities and gives the Secretary of State greater control over local government housing matters. Central Government again seek to influence heavily the work of local housing authorities. The Government will have greater control over local authority housing revenue accounts.<br><br>
The Bill will also allow local authority housing tenants to subsidise poll tax payers if there is a surplus. The Secretary of State's track record of using regulations shows that there will be an order that all subsidies, increases and surpluses in the housing revenue account must be transferred to subsidise poll tax payers. I am sure that that will be one of his decrees, but the arrangement will not be vice versa. Poll tax payers will be unable to help people with high rents and low incomes. The provision is a further attack by the Government on council house tenants, especially those on low incomes.<br><br>
Contributions from the rate fund form a relatively small proportion of the housing revenue account. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said that it was about 10 per cent. I consider that nationally contributions from the rate fund form 8 to 9 per cent. of the housing revenue account. This is not a major issue, but the Government wish to introduce legislation to prevent local authorities from making contributions to the housing revenue account from the general rate fund or, as it will soon be, the poll tax fund.<br><br>
The authorities that make contributions from the rate fund to the housing revenue account are not all Labour-controlled. They are of all political colours and come from all parts of the political spectrum throughout the country. In 1988–89, about 200 local authorities made contributions from the rate fund, two thirds of which were equivalent to less than 1 per cent. of the housing revenue accounts. The transfer of such funds is not a major problem. Local authorities were trying only to ensure a balance and, as the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 936</span>
Young) said, to level the playing pitch. Contributions from the rate fund amounted to only 1 per cent. of housing revenue income.<br><br>
The largest rate fund contributions are made by the metropolitan councils, predominantly in the capital, but including Manchester, Salford, Oldham, Liverpool and Newcastle. That is because they have specific housing cost problems. In the cities it is not just Labour councils that make rate fund contributions. London authorities making rate fund contributions to the housing revenue account in 1988–89 included the City of London, Tory-controlled Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Harrow, Barnet and democratically-controlled Tower Hamlets.<br><br>
The issue does not refer specifically to Labour-controlled authorities. Ministers cannot point at Labour-controlled authorities. Some Tory authorities make contributions because they realise that their housing costs are such that they need a contribution from their ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that the London borough of Harrow is contributing to rents. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee the basis of that calculation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made that clear. The basis of the calculation is that housing costs in Harrow are so high that it has to make a contribution. It is also because of the cut in subsidy and the cuts in housing investment programmes. Harrow is contributing to help balance the housing revenue account and to ensure that rents are not too high for tenants to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Harrow is a good housing authority, but I asked the hon. Gentleman for the basis of his figures. Where did he get them from?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are on record, and were revealed by research. The figures are available in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give the Committee the figures? Barnet contributed £17,000, just a balancing amount, whereas Camden contributed £44 million. There is a slight difference in those figures. It would be helpful to have the odd figure, rather than general verbiage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a minor issue. I am pleased that the Minister intervened because he revealed that although Barnet made a contribution of only £17,000, it was to balance the housing revenue account. The purpose of payments from the rate fund into the housing revenue account is to make it balance at the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not say that. He said that Harrow contributed because of the high cost of housing in London. He changed the facts because he did not know the figures. Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that Camden is so thoroughly bad and its accounts so out of balance that it has to find £44 million at the end of the year? Is the reason because it got its sums wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is misleading the Committee, which he often does. The record of our proceedings will reveal that the Minister changes his mind. This is a further example.<br><br>
There are many poor people in the borough of Camden who must be assisted out of the rate funds. In Harrow and Camden the housing revenue accounts were allowed to go
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0935">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 937</span>
into deficit and sums were transferred from the rate fund to make up that deficit. The issues may be different because of the type of tenants that local authorities have to cater for. There is nothing wrong with the principle, but the Bill wants to kill that spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why Manchester put £51 million into the housing revenue account but Wakefield—I give a random example—put in nil? Does that mean that there are no poor people in Wakefield, but £51 million-worth in Manchester? It is all a load of rubbish and the hon. Gentleman knows it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister had been listening, he would have heard me say that 200 local authorities put
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 938</span>
money from the rate fund into the housing revenue account. A devil of a lot of authorities do not make such contributions and Wakefield is one of them. I could have told the Minister that before he started. The circumstances in some cases are completely different from what the Minister implies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunket <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that irrespective of the amounts put into the housing revenue account, it does not alter one iota the clause—</span></p>
