DISQUALIFICATION AND POLITICAL RESTRICTION OF CERTAIN OFFICERS AND STAFF</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed [28th February],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Ouestion again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of our previous sitting I was completing my remarks on whether the clause should stand as part of the Bill. I suggested to the Committee that the clause is an essential part of the proposals originating from the Widdicombe report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Will the Minister please speak up? I cannot hear a word of what he says. Perhaps I am becoming a little deaf in my old age.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Alternatively, hon. Members conducting private conversations could do so more quietly, which would also be of assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr Steinberg). It is the first time that a member of a Committee has complained about not being able to hear me. Hon. Members usually make the opposite complaint, and I take the hon. Gentleman's point of order as a complaint.<br><br>
The clause is based on the findings of the Widdicombe Committee which, as an independent committee examining at the conduct of local government, saw considerable danger in allowing the sort of twin-tracking that we have discussed.<br><br>
Apart from the difficulty of giving independent advice as an officer of a local authority while at the same time being involved in the imbroglio of party politics, there are two other relevant considerations.<br><br>
First, we must consider the comfort of those who seek the advice of local authority officers and who expect information to come from the independent staff whom, historically and rightly, they have been able to approach. I place great emphasis on that. Those of us who have access to so many sources of advice must remember that the local authority is the prime and probably only source of advice for many people, especially at the lower end of the scale for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
individual guidance on housing and social services. I take seriously their need to have the utmost confidence in the advice that they receive.<br><br>
Secondly, under the present system, local government officers in heavily politicised councils find it increasingly difficult to maintain their status and their reputation for independence. Evidence from the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, from other organisations and from many individuals shows that many officials feel deeply that when they became local government officers they chose to be non-party political because that was the right role for them. Even if they continue to act in that way, their position becomes extremely difficult if others around, above and below them take an active part in party politics.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee agrees that the clause should be accepted because of the arguments on high political profiles and twin-tracking between different councils and because of the serious effects on the ability of ordinary people to approach officers as they wish. Just as important is the serious effect on morale among local government officers who, like many civil servants, sought their particular jobs because their forte, interest, ability and concern was in giving impartial, independent advice rather than in party-political argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised the issue that he should perhaps clarify of the independence of chief officers and their attitude in giving advice and assistance to the general public and members of their council. If a chief officer's son, daughter or wife is active in a political party, would that have a bearing on the impartiality of the father or spouse? Is the Minister also has to be impartial when he is away from the office? Such questions will be asked, and we need clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon Gentleman raises the matter, obviously it needs to be clarified, although I do not believe that anyone else has raised it. It would be inconceivable and wholly improper to blame one person or to deal with that person on the basis of someone else's political views. May I give the example of my own family? My father is a priest and he always maintained a clear independence of party politics when he was a parish priest. That suited him, because I happen to know that he held two party-political views during that period, but the people for whom he worked did not know that. He put his job above his party-political views because he felt that he could not minister to all the people in his parish if he were seen to take a strong party-political line. He always voted, of course, but he did not think it proper either to belong to a party or to take part in party politics. His son was active in party politics—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which party did his son belong to?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The one thing that I have been is politically monogamous. At the age of 11, I gave up being a member of the Liberal party and put away childish things. We have had sharp party-political arguments in this subject, so I shall put my view in the most moderate and direct way that I can. We shall all recognise that there is considerable concern among career local government officers—I do not say that offensively; they are the people who enter local government with the intention of making it their vocation and career—to maintain their public reputation for impartiality. That is equally true of the Civil Service. But a problem arises in that some people, whose motives I do not impugn, find it possible to be high-profile party-political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
activists at the same time as being independent advisers. The majority of local government officers are put in extremely difficult position because the minority are seen to be doing something that undermines the very position that local government officers chose to take.<br><br>
It is for that reason above all others—those others have considerable strength, and were they the only reasons I would still support the clause—that I hope that the Committee will feel it right to have clause 1 as part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. I had personal problems which caused me to go home last week, so I should like now to continue where I left off.<br><br>
It is fundamentally wrong that all local authority officers should not be able to offer themselves for election to another authority, not merely those who are politically restricted. From what the Minister and his colleagues said, I understand that they wish to bring local government into line with the Civil Service. If that is right, they clearly do not understand what local government is all about. First, it is completely inappropriate to compare civil servants who wish to become Members of the House of Commons, for example, with local government officers. Local government officers cannot become members of the authority for which they work. Secondly, there are not many local authority Members who can be described as being supported by ratepayers while furthering their political careers. We heard about that recently.<br><br>
My experience is the other way round. It is of local government professionals who wish to put something back into local government and the community, and there their political ambition ends. They wish to serve the community that has perhaps employed them for a number of years, or a different community. They have no further political ambitions than putting something back into the community.<br><br>
I apologise to the Committee for the delay while I turn to the next page of my speaking notes. My dog bit one of my fingers right through to the bone and I find it difficult to handle my notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, South-West, the Under-Secretary of State is the Minister who is responsible for dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister responsible for dogs saw the poll that was carried out on the Jameson show. I think that about 25,000 people want a dog registration scheme and about 1,000 do not, so perhaps a clause about that could be added to the Bill later.<br><br>
Even if we accept the need to end twin-tracking—I do not—to ban local authority members from party activity is ludicrous. Take, for example, the junior finance officer of a local authority who goes along to the local Conservative club, throws a few darts at the dart board, agrees to help with the bar accounts in his spare time and is then made assistant treasurer of the club. Why should he be prevented from taking an active part in local politics?<br><br>
I should like another aspect of subsection (5) clarified. Would close involvement by a local authority member with a local government union—a branch officer of the National and Local Government Officers Association for example, who is in a politically restricted post—cost him his job?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
After all, NALGO officers have in the past been known to comment on matters outside their brief, and this could be regarded as being outside their professional responsibilities. We all know that NALGO, although not affiliated to any particular party in party political circumstances. We need to know whether members of NALGO will be debarred from holding specific posts in their union. I hope that it is not the Government's intention to squeeze trade union activities or activists—if it is not, it will be the first time—but it will give Right-wing Conservative authorities such as Westminster and Wandsworth an excuse to do the deed.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many issues which divide the House of Commons and it would be a pity to divide this Committee on matters where there is no distinction between us. There is no question of the Bill applying to membership of a local government union, or to trade union activity, any more than the arrangements for civil servants stop them from belonging to, running, and sometimes being extremely vociferous in Civil Service unions. There is no difference between us on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Minister's answer. I shall mention a particular Civil Service union later.<br><br>
In my local district council, there are two examples of people who will be disqualified under subsection (5). They are both honourable and professional people. The first is Councillor Gary Birch, an administrator in the social services department of Durham City council, who is the leader of Durham district council. The Bill will prevent Councillor Birch from participating in local politics. But Councillor Birch may have ambitions to come to this place. Why, in the name of Heaven, must there be restrictions that will forbid him furthering his ambitions to become a Member of Parliament? I understand the argument for preventing councillor Birch continuing as leader of Durham City council, although I do not accept it, but I cannot see why the Government should wish to prevent him furthering his political ambitions.<br><br>
The second example is that of an officer who works for Chester-le-Street district council as chief personnel officer. He is my election agent. He is an extremely professional officer and there have never been any complaints about the way that he does his job. The Bill will prevent him from being my agent and from handing out leaflets at election time. That is outrageous and I do not know how the Government can justify it. People in the district council go to Mr. Ward for help with their problems. He gives professional advice which has never been questioned, but the Bill will prevent him being my agent. That is ludicrous.<br><br>
Did the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member of Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), when she was a local governemtn officer, give professional advice, or was it not impartial? If she is saying that her advice when she was a social worker in local government was not impartial, she should resign from the House of Commons. How can the hon. Lady push a Bill through the House of Commons that will affect those who are in exactly the same position as she was? That is hypocrisy. The hon. Lady should get out of the House, She has no right to be here. The hon. Lady does not believe that those who are in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
the position that she occupied should have the right to be Members of Parliament. The hon. Lady should get on her bike and get out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am worried about the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) because since he returned to these proceedings he seems to be frothing at the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be worried about me now. The only time he should be worried is when I come over to the Government benches and bite his head off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) resumes his speech, I shall advise him that he is going over matters that have already been raised at length during our debates on the amendments. I made a specific appeal for short speeches in this debate on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. I hope the hon. Gentleman will listen to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be long, Mr. Hunt. I was not here for the Tuesday debate and I was unaware that certain matters were discussed. Perhaps I should have realised that they were.<br><br>
We are worried about the erosion of rights under the Government. Five minutes ago the Minister told us that he had no problems with trade union rights and that civil servants can continue with their union activities. This morning, however, we heard on the news that Mr. Morris from GCHQ has been sacked. He is the last union member to get his cards at GCHQ, which means that 1,700 people have lost their jobs. Therefore, we are still worried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about that worry. I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no job in local government for which the security classification is such that it would be inappropriate for a person to be a member of a trade union. That is a clear statement. There is no difficulty in this Bill, or reason for concern about the proper action that the Government have taken over GCHQ.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said, there are exceptions.<br><br>
I was talking to acquaintances in my constituency—I say "acquaintances" because they are not friends—about the Bill, and they questioned me about it. One man likened the Bill to what went on in Nazi Germany before the war. Frankly, I am beginning to see the Minister with black hair receding over his forehead and with a little black moustache—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I came to the House I was a head teacher, a councillor and a prospective parliamentary candidate. I can honestly say that not once did I make a decision that affected my kids at school or the parents who came to see me which was influenced by my politics. I accept that teachers are to be exempted at this stage.<br><br>
I worked for local government and the Minister worked for local government. I gave impartial advice and I know that the Minister gave impartial advice. I am saying that 99 per cent. of the people who work in local government give impartial advice.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
The Bill will not stop people acting on their opinions, it will merely stop them expressing them. It will not stop people influencing local authority decisions, but it will make it harder for us to know about that. The Bill will drive people underground to participate in politics.<br><br>
The Bill is supposed to pose as an impartialising agent but its motives are deeply political. The Government deplore politicisation of local government but they are responsible because of their hostile attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak about the former employment of Mr. Derek Hatton by the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley. I do so because on Second Reading the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) used this as an example of why the provisions that we are discussing should stand. I do not believe that it is right to let that go without setting the record straight about what took place.<br><br>
I have a note that was given to me by the chief executive of Knowsley borough council. It is a résume of Mr. Hatton's employment with the council and his simultaneous involvement with Liverpool city council, and it will put the record straight.<br><br>
Mr. Hatton was employed on 16th August 1976 as an area community development officer on grade SO1. There were 33 applicants for the post. He continued in the post until 1982 when he was redeployed as a management assistant on grade SO1. On 11th November 1983, he was transferred to a new post of voluntary sector liaison officer on grade SO1/2. Mr. Hatton was ultimately summarily dismissed for gross misconduct on 23rd July 1986.<br><br>
On 8th March 1980, Mr. Hatton's time off for council duties as a member of Liverpool city council—it was Liberal-controlled at the time—and as a NALGO lay official was fixed at no more than six days per month. At the time, there was no formal scheme for time off in existence. Persistent requests by Mr Hatton for more time off were refused by Knowsley council. On 27th November 1981, because of his increasing commitment as a city councillor—he was then shadow deputy leader—Mr. Hatton's time off entitlement for approved council and trade union duties was increased to a maximum of two days per week.<br><br>
A system of monitoring and control, exerciseable by the chief officer, who was answerable to the council, was introduced specifically for Mr. Hatton. Disciplinary action was to result in the event of non-compliance. These controls necessitated the completing of timesheets by Mr. Hatton.<br><br>
On 7th December 1981, the council approved a scheme for time off covering all employees. For a council leader, time off would be by negotiation, for the chairman of a major committee a maximum of two days per week and for a member a maximum of one day per week. Under this scheme, 75 per cent. of any attendance allowance received by employees had to be repaid to Knowsley council and the borough treasurer was to monitor the arrangements personally.<br><br>
On 7th September 1983, Mr. Hatton, now deputy leader of Liverpool city council, was given a maximum entitlement of two and a half days per week. He retained that entitlement until his dismissal.<br><br>
On 20th November 1984, the district auditor expressed general satisfaction with the council's scheme for time off, including the arrangements for Mr. Hatton. However, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
district auditor spoke of the need to secure a regular flow of work return forms from him. The chief executive and chief officer tried to obtain the returns. On 25th September 1985, Mr. Hatton was subjected to further proceedings for non-submission of time sheets. Further promises were made but not kept. On 9th June 1986, a final warning was issued to Mr. Hatton by the chief officer. He still did not comply with instructions. On 21st July 1986, Mr. Hatton was dismissed for gross misconduct. The decision was taken by the chairman and vice-chairman of the personnel committee and a subsequent appeal was dismissed by six other members of the council.<br><br>
I contend that the council took reasonable steps to secure time off for its employees through a formal scheme. It worked well—and still does—for all employees except Mr. Hatton, who abused it and the authority which accorded him the facilities. The abuse constituted grave misconduct, for which he was rightly dismissed.<br><br>
I have mentioned these matters because argument has centred around Mr. Hatton's case being justification for the Bill's provisions when, in fact, the story demonstrates that he was a difficult person for Knowsley to have on its payroll. The council acted reasonably and tried to help him, but, when he failed to comply with reasonable instructions, he was dismissed.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I have grave political differences with Mr. Hatton which are well documented. My personal opposition to his politics is long-standing and well known. But even though I fundamentally disagree with him, I defend his right to stand for a local authority, although he is currently not permitted to do so. Once that ban has been lifted, if he wants to stand under some label for election to a local authority—he could not be a Labour candidate because he was expelled from the Labour party—I shall defend his right to do so. Moreover if he were a competent professional—the facts indicate that in his latter time in Knowsley he was not—I should defend his right to act as a paid employee of a local authority at whatever grade was appropriate. In Mr. Hatton's case that would probably not apply because I doubt whether a local authority would touch him. Equally, knowing Mr. Hatton's current business activities, I doubt whether £13,500 a year would be an attractive enough inducement for him to give up being a male model, for example.<br><br>
If in future however Mr. Hatton secured professional employment in a local authority for which he was competent and if he could carry out those duties properly and remain a member of a local authority, whether it be Liverpool or another, I should defend his right to do so, much as I disagree with many of his views.<br><br>
It is on that important and fundamental consideration that the Opposition disagree with the Government. We believe that it is possible to be a practising politician in local government and to be a professional local government officer, whether that job is technical, involves policy-making and so on. It is possible to perform both roles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was also involved in the Second Reading debate, I wish to tell the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) that I much respect the role that he played when Mr. Hatton was employed by the Knowsley authority.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
I wonder whether the hon. Member for Knowsley, North apply his argument to civil servants, who have not been allowed to perform two roles. In the past, local government officers have generally accepted informally that they should not have two roles. The taking of two roles is a fairly recent practice. Does the hon. Gentleman think that his party would want civil servants at all levels taking an active part in party politics? It is an important issue that may come between us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn too far into that discussion because you would probably rule me out of order, Mr. Hunt, and I do not wish to incur your wrath.<br><br>
Much would depend on the grade of the civil servant. I envisage no real problem in a relatively junior grade civil servant taking an active part in politics, provided that that does not conflict with his or her role as a civil servant. Further up the grades, where there is a clear relationship between a Minister and a civil servant, the issue of political involvement becomes a bit more murky and more difficult.<br><br>
Incidentally, the politicisation of the Civil Service seems to have gone further more quickly under this Government than at any other time in the Civil Service's history. The respect for the Civil Service which was largely held throughout the world has diminished because of the activities of those like Mr. Bernard Ingham, although that is another story. Given that history, the Minister chose a rather poor example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot now have a debate on the Civil Service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the hon. Gentleman's illustration of the Civil Service, does he feel that in some local government jobs, to use his words, the balance is a bit more murky, and that it would be inappropriate for someone in such a job to be a local government officer and also to be elected to another local authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I do not defend every instance, but the case of Mr. Hatton proves that if local authorities are left to their own devices they will, by and large, sort out these matters. Local authority members and chief officers are generally people of good sense and will resolve the problem at that level. We do not need legislation. The Majority of elected members and professional officers in local government are of good faith and take their duties seriously. When there is a murky area they spot it and deal with it. The fact that unfortunate cases arise does not support the need for legislation because they are dealt with at lcoal authority level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At Knowsley there were general rules about time off. Did Knowsley council consider that there was any officer to whom it would not give time off for party-political activities, or was it willing to give time off to all officers, irrespective of their role in Knowsley or in the council on which they served?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The scheme approved was a maximum of one day off a week for a member, a maximum of two days a week for a chairman of a major committee and time off by negotiation for a council leader. The allowances were clear, and I am not sure how to take the answer further.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the chief executive had been elected as a member of a neighbouring authority, would he get one day off a week to serve on that authority, or two days if he was a chairman of a major committee? In other words, did Knowsley council mind whether any of its officers twin-tracked, or were there some murky areas where it would not allow an officer to be a party-political candidate elsewhere? It sounds from the scheme as though Knowsley council would allow any of its officers, irrespective of their jobs, to be party-political figures elsewhere and to have time off for the purpose? My question is whether the council would have allowed its chief executive to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that such a case has arisen. My guess is that if a chief executive wished to fight a local election and was selected as a candidate, he would have to discuss his intentions with the leader of the council. I cannot speak for the leader of the Knowsley council, but I believe that he would strongly discourage his chief executive from becoming a candidate.<br><br>
It would be unusual for a local authority chief executive to decide to become involved as a councillor elsewhere. He might be tempted, but such a course would be exceptional. If he did, good sense would prevail. The leader of the local authority would exercise common sense and caution and would discourage such involvement by its chief executive or by its chief officers. I do not believe that such circumstances are likely to arise in Knowsley or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What advice would the hon. Gentleman give to the chief executive of Clydebank who was a member of Glasgow city council, or to the chief executive of Lliw valley who was chairman of the local Labour party? These are not fictional cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are also Conservative authorities where people are politically active. I believe that officials should voluntarily refrain from seeking such a profile while they are chief officers.<br><br>
We are in danger of legislating to deal with a few alleged abuses. There may be one or two cases. I am glad that no one has asked my advice in these circumstances, but I would discourage anyone from seeking a high political profile as well as having a high professional profile in local government. We do not need legislation. These matters can be left to the good sense of local government and, by and large, local authorities exercise extreme good sense on behalf of their communities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) referred to my comments on Mr. Hatton during our first sitting, perhaps I ought to respond.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North seems to have missed the point. In my intervention, which is recorded in column 17 of <i>Hansard.</i> I asked how long Mr. Hatton had been employed by Knowsley borough council before it took action. It was clear from the hon. Gentleman's report that Mr. Hatton was employed there for a considerable time, and that, for at least four or five years, he was hardly ever in place to do his job before Knowsley council took action. That highlights the difficulty that senior council officers have in taking action against a colleague who is twin-tracking in another authority and abusing his position. Clearly it was difficult for Knowsley to do what it did.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North said—this was recorded in columm 22 of <i>Hansard</i>—that it was difficult for councillors to sack Mr. Hatton. It raises the question of how much time councillors should have available to them for other duties. The hon. Member for Knowsley, North has exposed an issue that perhaps we should consider under another clause—namely, whether we should allow councillors to have off two and a half days a week at ratepayers' expense. It is scandalous that authorities give their employees so much free time that they cannot do the job for which ratepayers employ them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has conceded that this is a matter for debate later in the Bill, not on clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is depressing for someone who represents a Scottish constituency to listen to the debate. It seems that the genesis of the bill is Derek Hatton. Conservative Members seem to be obsessed with him. They drafted this outrageous Bill, which will affect the whole United Kingdom because of a single example of several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I return to my example of the chief executive of Clydebank, who was a party political member of Glasgow city council. May I make it clear yet again that I should find that entirely unacceptable, whatever party a person belonged to—Labour, Conservative or Liberal, or any of its varieties. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is reasonable for the chief executive of Clydebank to be a party political member of Glasgow city council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept it. It is a question of what the Clydebank and Glasgow voters think reasonable that matters not what I think. There is no suggestion anywhere in Scotland that any officer who holds an elected post in another authority is guilty of abuse of any sort. If the Minister has evidence of abuse in local government in Scotland perhaps he will let us have it. I will not accept as evidence the fact that a local government officer holds an elected postion. The Minister will have to prove that an officer abused his position for the advantage of his own political party to the disadvantage of electors and ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case will the hon. Gentleman explain why the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives has made it clear that it considers it impossible for someone to undertake the job of chief executive and be involved in party politics. That is the view of one independent body which changed its rules to make it impossible for such a person to become one of its members. I accept its independent view.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only important viewpoint is that of the electors. Clydebank and Glasgow electors are quite content to have elected administrations—one of which includes a local government officer as an elected councillor; the other employs an elected councillor as a local government officer. They see no cause for concern. There is no mandate in Scotland for the Bill. The Minister is imposing his obsessions on the Scottish people, who are not interested in them.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend should ask the Minister whether the message has got through to his own party, because the right hon. Gentleman does not seem to have the total support of his own party either. After all, it is well known that the chief executive of St. Albans is standing as a Conservative candidate in local elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a poor point. I have said already that if such a thing happens it is completely unacceptable and entirely wrong. I have said so from the beginning and have even named the individuals who I thought behaved improperly.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) raised this issue, will he tell the Committee on which occasion the people of Clydebank have an opportunity to vote for their chief executive? A chief executive is not available for public vote, he is appointed. That is the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not listen. I said that the people of Clydebank voted for an administration which appointed as its chief executive an elected councillor from another authority. The right hon. Gentleman knew that that appointment has been made. If he had been unhappy about it, he would have replaced that administration with another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are told that 70,000 to 90,000 people will be affected by the Bill. How many are chief executives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a tremendously valid point. I suspect that the Minister does not have an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing chief executives only because the hon. Member for Knowsley, North raised the issue. I was seriously trying to tease out of the Minister whether he thought that there were limits. We began at the top. The hon. Member for Dundee, East may have noticed that each time his hon. Friends speak they produce a new example of twin-tracking and offer reasons why it should not be allowed under the Bill. The fascinating thing about the Bill is that since it has been in the public domain we know that more and more people are involved in twin-tracking than we imagined. The hon. Member for Leeds, West gave us two examples, which we have noted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has yet to point to one example of abuse anywhere in Scotland that would justify these legislative proposals. Being an elected member of another council is not in itself an abuse. The Minister has yet to make a case for his assertions. He would have to explain how the chief executive of Clydebank district council has abused his position. He has no evidence that he does. You, Mr. Hunt, reprimanded my hon. Friends for attacking individuals who had no right of reply, but that is what the Minister is doing.<br><br>
The Minister said that the Committee was not divided about the part that was played by local government officers in local government unions such as NALGOA. May I refer him to the case of the chairman of NALGOA in Dundee, who, because of his position in the union, also holds the post of chairman of Dundee trades council. He chairs meetings such as the anti-poll tax meeting in City square in Dundee. He also leads the May Day rally. That is a very party political event during which speakers generally make party political speeches, usually against the Conservative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
Government. Is the Minister saying that that man will be barred from playing his full roles in NALGOA and on Dundee trades council because he will be regarded as holding a politically restricted post? Will he be unable to continue his trade union duties? If so, then we are divided on the issue. The Opposition feel that local government officers shoud be able to enjoy the full range of trade union rights like any other union member. Tory Members obviously do not.<br><br>
The gist of the Minister's remarks related to twin-tracking, on which the Government apply amazing double standards. He spoke about the type of abuse that councillors practised in offering well-paid jobs to their political friends. He described the practice as despicable, but the Secretary of State for Scotland has done precisely the same. Mr. Michael Ancram, a former Member of Parliament, was defeated at the last general election. Everyone would accept that Mr. Ancram is a political friend of the Secretary of State. After the election, the Secretary of State for Scotland appointed him to the well-paid post of director of the new housing agency, Scottish Homes. The Minister says that he is upset about councils appointing their political friends to well-paid posts. Is he upset about Mr. Michael Ancram's appointment to Scottish Homes by his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was the hon. Gentleman upset when the previous Labour Prime Minister appointed his son-in-law to be the British ambassador in Washington?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that he was the previous Labour Prime Minister, I am sure that his son-in-law was himself upset about it.<br><br>
There are many examples other than Michael Ancram. Alex Fletcher lost his seat—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed a passing reference to other appointments, but they do not relate to the clause. The hon. Gentleman cannot pursue that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is silent, although he usually intervenes to defend his position. The point that I am trying to make is that the Government are appointing their political friends to well paid posts while introducing legislation to prevent councils from doing exactly that. It is hypocrisy; it is a case of double standards. The Minister is silent and does not respond. Stopping jobs for the boys should apply to Tories as well as to Labour.<br><br>
Subsection (5) is another reason why clause 1 should not stand part of the Bill. Under it, the terms and conditions of employment of local government officers will be radically altered not by negotiation between officers and their employers, but by diktat of the Secretary of State for England and Wales or the Secretary of State for Scotland, who will simply make regulations that radically alter the conditions of employment of local government officers.<br><br>
It is an outrage that, this morning, at GCHQ at Cheltenham, the last trade unionist is being sacked simply for being a member of a trade union. Local government officers are similary to be denied their right to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment with their employer. Another case of double standards is when the Prime Minister and other Tories wander across to Poland and embrace Solidarity and trade union rights in that

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
country, while they continually undermine trade union rights in their own country through legislation of this kind and impose their diktat on trade union members.<br><br>
My last point concerns the very wide powers that are given to the Secretary of State for Scotland under the clause. He will be free to bring in regulations that will restrict the political freedom and activities of thousands of local government workers in Scotland. What worries me is that the Secretary of State for Scotland will have a licence to use his powers partially. Over the past few years the present Secretary of State for Scotland has gone through health boards removing every STUC nominee that he can. Some 15 STUC nominees have been removed, simply because they speak up against the Government. The same is true of college councils. When making appointments in all spheres, the Secretary of State for Scotland shows that he is politically partial and tries to eliminate anyone who speaks up against him. Giving such a person the wide powers in clause 1 must be a matter of concern to anyone who takes a genuine interest in civil liberties and democracy.<br><br>
The Minister pretends that he is a defender of civil liberties and that he believes in individual rights, but this clause proposes to take away the individual rights of thousands of people, not because they voted for it or agree with it, but because an elected minority that represents a minority of the country is imposing its will on everyone else. That may be many things, but it is not democracy, and the Minister should recognise it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is the kernel of the Bill. It is clear from what Conservative Members have said that a considerable amount of malice is directed against local authorities, in particular against Labour-controlled local authorities.<br><br>
The Minister talks about twin-tracking as though it has only just been invented. Twin-tracking is not an expression that I like, but it is one that we all now seem to understand. It has been going on for years in local government, and no Government, either Conservative or Labour, have seen fit to introduce legislation to deal with it.<br><br>
In an intervention, I told the Minister about a clear case of twin-tracking in the London borough of Newham. It had been going on for many years. It involved council members and employees being exchanged between the London boroughs of Hackney and Newham, both of which are Labour controlled. Labour Members are open and honest, and we want to address these problems without any hint of hypocrisy. The Labour parties in the east end were very worried about what was going on. The common ground between the officers and members of Hackney and Newham was that they all shared membership of the same masonic lodge. That does not seem to worry the Government. It is perfectly acceptable to be a member of a masonic lodge and a police officer, despite the fact that the previous commissioner of police of the Metropolis—and, indeed, the present commissioner—said that that he did not believe that being a member of a masonic lodge was compatible with the independence—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is nothing about masonic lodges in the clause, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not expand on the point.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is not, Mr. Hunt. I almost wish there were. I merely present a further example of what we see as the Government's hypocrisy. I shall not pursue the point. It was a case of twin-tracking that the Labour parties in Hackney and Newham dealt with effectively, without much publicity and without legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause will not kill off politics among local government officers, it will merely drive politics underground? There are already enough underground politics with masonry in local government, and it may be more honest to tackle that, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should be tackled—perhaps a register would do. A man is entitled to be a member of a masonic lodge. We live in a free society—well, almost; what little is left of it after the actions of the Prime Minister. People are free enough to be masons, if they want; all we ask is that they declare it, so that when magistrates or police officers investigate people, everyone will know who has other loyalties and affiliations. It is a matter of being honest and straightforward. But can we get a voluntary code out of the Government? No, we cannot. That is why we bridle at the Bill and at clause 1, in particular.<br><br>
Twin-tracking came to the Government's attention because of a few fairly well publicised examples. I agree that there has been an increase in the number of Left-wing Labour councillors who have been twin-tracking. It has been going on for years, as I said, but the Government chose not to notice, and certainly not to interfere, because the people who were twin-tracking did not politically disturb Mama Doc in 10 Downing Street. When the Government see a political enemy, they move quickly to remove that enemy, whether within the ranks of the Conservative party, within the Opposition or in town halls.<br><br>
The clause, like the Bill, is based on prejudice and on the fact that the Minister now believes the propaganda that has been fed into the newspapers. But that propaganda has now come back full circle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel that the Widdicombe Committee was entirely wrong in proposing that all local authority workers above principal officer level should be absolutely barred from political activities? That was not what the Prime Minister proposed; it was what the Widdicombe Committee proposed. Was the Widdicombe Committee wrong in making that assessment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We are talking about £13,500, not principal officer level. I said to the Minister, and I am honest and open enough to say it again, that I am somewhat uneasy about twin-tracking. I have always been uneasy about it. I was uneasy when it involved Right-wing Labour councillors, and I am equally uneasy when it involves Left-wing Labour councillors, because I am uneasy about the principle. I was an elected member of a local authority for many years until the Government viciously abolished the council to which I had given many years of distinguished service.<br><br>
11.30 pm<br><br>
I was anxious that my senior officers should be able to devote sufficient time to the affairs of the council of which I was an elected member. I was not concerned about the partiality of their views because it is for elected members to cope with political matters—they should not shelter behind the decisions of their officers or the information that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0486">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
receive from them. I wanted to make sure that time was available and, given the work load of the Greater London council, I did not consider that there was sufficient time to allow a large number of its officers to be elected councillors elsewhere.<br><br>
I share the Minister's unease, but my approach to the problem would be completely different. The Minister said that people should have outside jobs because that means that they bring to bear greater experience than they could have gained in local government. I sympathise with his point of view, but his approach is wrong. If the Minister genuinely believes that twin-tracking is undesirable, he should have produced proposals for the proper payment of councillors so that they do not have to seek employment elsewhere. His proposals should have included allowances for carers and single-parent families and legislation making it compulsory for all employers to give elected councillors sufficient time off. If the Minister had come up with such proposals, I could have shared his anxiety about the way in which twin-tracking might affect the work of authorities and councils, although I am not, of course, saying that officers give biased information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, when the Gentleman was with the Greater London council, he was concerned lest his officers spent too much time on other councils, why does he suggest that I introduce legislation to force employers to allow time off to people who serve on councils? Is that not a double standard?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. If it is done generally, the burden is shared and it is less invidious. A flourishing participatory, accountable local democracy requires employers to give time off. The largest and most progressive employers do that now, but many refuse.<br><br>
It is a laudable ambition to want to serve one's local community through a local authority, but the Government have gone out of their way to make such an ambition more and more difficult. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) said that he cannot understand why anyone would now want to become an elected councillor, and I know what he means. The Government have restricted the independence of local authorities and constrained the actions of elected local councillors. If we want a proper, flourishing local democracy we must acknowledge that people want careers, proper remuneration and time off to attend their local authority business. If the Government had produced such proposals in the wake of an inquiry, I would have said that we had the basis of a deal. Given that they have moved in malice to make life even more difficult for local authorities and local councillors, I shall vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to draw the attention of Labour Members to some interesting parliamentary answers that have been given to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). They concern time off in the Civil Service, in the Scottish Office, 12·5 per cent. of civil servants are in the politically-restricted category and are unable to take part in politics. I calculate that of the 3,000,000 local government staff in the United Kingdom, 2·3 per cent.—70,000 according to Opposition Members—will be in the same position as the 12·5 per cent. of civil servants. That does not seem fair to me.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm that even in the politically-restricted category, civil servants are permitted to appeal. Although every appeal has been turned down, the right exists, even though it has not been tested by a confirmation that the Government may, occasionally, be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is similar provision in the Bill for local government officers. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman is going on about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There cannot be an intervention in an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my right hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has a point. Those in the category of chief officer do not have the right of appeal, neither do those whom a local authority decides are in such a category. However, in relation to the second group, there is no change in the present position. Any local authority employer has the right to say to any employee, "You may not take part in party politics if you take this job." there is no appeal against that; the position does not change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I understood the position to be. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] If the Opposition are so concerned, they should, when they were in power, have allowed their top civil servants to take part in political activities at a local level. They did not do so because they recognised that there was a conflict of interests and they wished to restrict the right of civil servants. The Government are right to demand the same high standards of local government officers as they demand of top civil servants.</span></p>

I find it hard to understand why the Minister has included this provision, bearing in mind the arguments he has used in Committee. It is common sense to remove political advisers to local authority groups from the list of politically restricted groups. The suggestion that political appointees to council groups are not allowed, in their spare time, to pursue their political beliefs is absurd. Presumably, it is because of their actions and beliefs that they are employed.<br><br>
In view of the comments in the White Paper, I welcome Ministers' acceptance that, in some cases, there should be political advisers in local authorities. I hasten to add that I have no local vested interest, because none exists in my part of the world. Nevertheless, it is necessary, particularly for larger local authorities where the roles taken on by individuals are considerable, to say that the Government's attitude has been difficult to fathom, not only on this restriction but throughout their approach to political advisers. Widdicombe supported the role of political advisers, and the Government's response made it clear that they wanted to ban such appointments. The Government have accepted that that should not happen, however, and I welcome it.<br><br>
Suggesting that local authority employees should be restricted in a way Members' researchers are not, is completely wrong. The Bill allows for such individuals to be given an exemption, but the strict reasons outlined by the Minister for other people being banned simply do not apply in this case. It is hard to imagine that someone from one political party would go to another for impartial advice. He reports to the party that appointed him. I suppose the Minister is thinking in terms of their abusing their payment by spending their time politically campaigning, but that will be dealt with elsewhere in the Bill, in the way Widdicombe recommended, by the rules on taking time out from work.<br><br>
When defining political advisers, Widdicombe also said why we should not accept the lines that the amendment seeks to delete. It was made abundantly clear that there was an advantage in having political advisers who serve a group, as opposed to local authority officers. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do believe that they provide a useful means of broadening the basis for advice to councillors in a way which should positively promote rather than damage the role of the main officer hierarchy of serving the whole council."</p></blockquote>
In other words, they are employed for their political beliefs and, in most cases, their political track records. It is hard to see why that track record should be drawn to a halt when they are working for their political party. I cannot understand why such people should not be allowed to take on other roles, outside the time when they are working for an authority. Will the Minister explain that, I would prefer him to say why he does not accept that that is consistent.<br><br>
Advisers have political convictions—they would not be employed otherwise. To say that they are not allowed to canvas or represent their parties in their own time and speak to others could conflict with some of the things a group may legitimately ask them to do.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I get the impression that the Minister's gut view is that he prefers the White Paper response, but that his arm has been severely twisted to allow political advisers to be included. In some way, lines, 22 and 23 are a last fling, or possibly an act of revenge for not having got the White Paper response through.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
I believe that the result will be that local authority groups will not get the high quality, high flyers they hope for because most of those high flyers are likely to put political involvement and standing for election first. They may well have to give up things that they have spent a life-time being involved with in local politics to take on this role.<br><br>
The Secretary of State clearly has doubts because the Bill appears to recognise that some concessions may be needed. Provision has been made to exempt advisers from at least some of the political restrictions. The Minister is aware that there are difficulties in the Bill because clause 1(6) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to section 140(1) below, may contain such exceptions for persons appointed in pursuance of section 9 below as he thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
If that is the case, and the Secretary of State accepts that there is a certain illogicality about this inclusion which may require special provision, I would rather see those exceptions written on the face of the Bill.<br><br>
A question also arises as to why there is no appeal procedure for these people. It is hard to see if the treasurer of a local party is also employed by a local authority as a political adviser, why and how the two roles could conflict. There is, however, no appeal procedure, and no provision to allow a local authority to take a different view. The Minister will accept that it is open to local authorities, to make these rules themselves, but the Minister believes that that should happen on all occasions and in all circumstances by law.<br><br>
I do not want to speak at length because the case is clear to me and, I hope, to the Minister. I shall be interested to hear his comments and that he accepts that this argument stands apart from all others that have been made on behalf of others whose responsibility is not to a political party but to a local authority and the people in its area and to be impartial, whereas the job of these people is to be partial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) put his case, and I hope that he will accept the spirit in which I shall try to answer it.<br><br>
I gave this matter a great deal of thought. When I was appointed to this job, I listened carefully to representations about the White Paper, which had been prepared earlier, and I took a different view on this part. One of the difficulties in our systems is that, if we say that we are convinced by the arguments and will change the legislation, we are accused of vacillating, and if we say that we will not change our minds, we are accused of not listening. I hope that the hon. Member for Truro will at least acquit me of vacillation.<br><br>
The Widdicombe Committee made a proposal, the Government's reaction was to propose something else and, on reflection, the many requests we received from all political parties led me to believe that there was a case for the equivalent, in local government, of the special adviser in national government. It was difficult to defend the argument that there should be such advisers in national government but not, for example, in Leeds city council. We carefully read the material. Our colleges took the same view. That is the reason for the change.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Truro used the words, "political adviser". I do not want to legislate for "political advisers" but for "special advisers" whose job would be exactly analogous to the special advisers in both Labour and Conservative Governments. Specific restrictions, which both sides considered right, are placed on those advisers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
Perhaps I may illustrate what could happen without such restrictions. The advisers operate in that difficult marginal area between party politics and local council activities or party politics and national government. It is proper for such a person in a local authority to chase up agendas for the interest of a particular party, and to prepare advice on such agendas recognising the specific interests of that party. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that role involves different priorities from when advice is to be given to the whole council. I am anxious that all officers, apart from those special ones, should be available to advise the whole council. No doubt the hon. Gentleman agrees with that. It is an important distinction.<br><br>
Special advisers are important. In some big councils, certain jobs have to be done for individual party groups. If they are not carried out by a special adviser, they will be done by someone who is technically, and who ought to be, an adviser to the whole council. That puts him in an invidious position.<br><br>
Many of the restrictions on the role of the special adviser in government and, if the clause is passed, in local government, are fairly obvious. The hon. Member for Truro raised the question of a person who is not standing for office while he or she has that job. Let me explain what led the Labour Government and the subsequent Conservative Government to lay down the restrictions. It was considered that there would be a legitimate ground for complaint if it seemed that the public taxpayer was paying someone to fight a party political seat. In a general election, for example, the taxpayer might pay someone to be the political adviser to a Conservative or Labour Minister while he or she was campaigning against an hon. Member.<br><br>
Let us suppose that Carrick had special advisers and that the Conservative party there, was in opposition. It would have a special adviser because the party in power—say the independents—had one. Suppose that that special adviser became the prospective parliamentary candidate for Truro. He might spend all his spare time and, perhaps, other time campaigning in Truro at the expense of the Truro electorate, while the hon. Member for Truro was doing his proper job at Westminster.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman might be worried about that. He might be extremely open minded and think that it was OK, but I suspect that many of his constituents—even those who did not support him—would wonder whether they should be paying for the Conservative candidate to spend his time in that way. Even if he scrupulously kept to the rules, they would see him as spending his time campaigning for the Conservative party to beat "Mr. Taylor, who is such a nice man".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Careful!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My anxiety is, I admit, not entirely for the hon. Member for Truro! The provision was not written specifically for him. Opposition Members are wont to suggest that we are not worried about the matter and that any such claim is merely hypocrisy, but I care greatly about the reputation of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been quite revealing. He has given the examples he had in mind. I understand the arguments, but with different examples they could be turned round and made equally valid. Again the Minister uses the grey cases. I cited the example of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
treasurer of a local association. Presumably the Minister would not apply the same argument there. Perhaps this is where he thinks that the Bill will allow him to make changes. I should prefer the Bill to be more precise. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may take the greyest case of all. Just as I used the example of a direct case, the hon. Gentleman rightly expressed his strongest argument.<br><br>
There is a difficulty. A treasurer of a local Liberal, Conservative or Labour party could probably carry out that work in his spare time and behave in a reasonable way. If it were simply a question of those kind of circumstances, I might not feel so desperately strongly about the issue. Suppose, however, that the person was a high profile treasurer, running a major campaign to raise money for the Liberal, Labour or Conservative cause in the south-west. In those circumstances, it would be reasonable for many local residents to wonder they should be spending money to give a job—that is how it would seem—to someone who carries out that party-political job outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all accept that a treasurer's job is to raise funds. In my constituency, for example, a treasurer would spend much time raising money from individuals and businesses to maintain the party organisation. Even if he did not have a high profile in the local press, the public would see such a person as a paid fund raiser for the Conservative party, salaried out of ratepayers' money. In that respect, the role of the treasurer is just as bad as any other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What nonsense. That is outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members say that is outrageous. Perhaps they will recognise that the hon. Member for Truro and I are having a serious discussion about a difficult matter. He would probably admit that my extreme example raises some problems. Incidentally, the Opposition introduced the very rules which stop special advisers to Ministers behaving in any of those ways. If the Opposition think that outrageous, they should refer to their right hon. and hon. Friends who made the rules in the first place. I am merely carrying into this legislation almost precisely what applies to the special advisers.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members were probably inspired to say, "outrageous" because the Minister's remarks could be applied to anyone working in a local authority. His was an argument for saying that anyone who is paid out of public funds should not be allowed to take part in politics.<br><br>
The best example is of the person who is upfront—the political appointee who is employed to advise a political group. Surely the general public will not think badly of him because he is a treasurer in his spare time. According to the Minister, they will say that, in any case, he is paid to do party-political work for his local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, the hon. Gentleman is not right. A special adviser is in effect appointed by the party group involved because an adviser whom it did not want could not be foisted on it. Other people working for local government are appointed impartially, and later clauses will ensure that that is so. In normal circumstances, people are appointed impartially.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
If an officer, who is appointed impartially by a properly constituted panel, with no question of political bias, does not have a politically sensitive job and takes part in party politics, it cannot be argued that he has been appointed and paid to do a job outside. That is clear. If he is appointed by a party that will benefit from his outside activities, the public have more reason for concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to ask a question because he is now straying into the dangerous issue of the individual's position in terms of the European.<br><br>
The Minister referred to a person who was employed as a political adviser. We heard a description of that person's duties—advising on agendas and collecting reports for members of the group. The individual has a job to do at all times. Surely outside his job he should have freedom of expression in his community and the right to hold opinions and to receive and impart information. If the Minister is suggesting that someone who works in local government as a special adviser and who earns less than £13,500 a year will be restricted in holding opinions and in offering information, the Minister is going beyond the notes on clauses. He is changing the concept of the freedom of the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be difficult to support that argument. The Bill contains precisely the conditions that the Labour party laid on its special advisers to hon. Gentlemen. I have not changed those terms, the hon. Gentleman rightly said that I proposed to ameliorate the conditions in some circumstances. For example, we must be careful that we do not stop people giving information locally, although the clause appears to prevent special advisers from doing so centrally. In a meeting in a locality, which contained people other than officers, it would be perfectly proper for the individual to put forward his views. I have tried to cover that aspect even though the previous Labour Government did not do so in terms of special advisers.<br><br>
I plead with Opposition Members. I recognise that we differ on fundamental issues, but we are at one that there should be special advisers in local government, although we could argue about how many there should be and how much they should be paid.<br><br>
The real analogy is with special advisers to Ministers. Indeed, it is one reason why I took this view. It is not unreasonable to import the analogy into the legislation and to lay on local authority employers precisely the same restrictions—with the specific ameliorations that I mentioned—that are at present laid on special advisers.<br><br>
I think that I am right in saying that the restrictions were drawn up by the Labour party. Certainly they were supported by it because it introduced the concept of special adviser in the first place. I do not blame the Opposition—we have carried that idea on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain why he feels that the link with the Civil Service political adviser is closest—rather than the link with the researcher for the Opposition parties, where none of those restrictions apply?<br><br>
Would the restriction embrace people who put themselves forward for selection by a local party as a prospective candidate?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly prepared to consider peripheral areas where it might be possible not to make it more difficult than it need be, and perhaps that is one of them. I think that there is a line to be drawn, and I drew it where I thought it was right. I thought that the analogous position was the best, but I am perfectly prepared to consider the matter and come back to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The reason for the discussion is exactly the same reason which, I think, led the Labour Government to make their decisions about special advisers. The situation of a Member of Parliament is different in the sense that he or she is given a specific sum of money out of public funds and decides how he or she will use it. We, the taxpayers, have decided that the system should operate in that manner.<br><br>
Like the special adviser in government, who is exactly parallel, that person is paid directly. He becomes an employee not of the party group, or the Minister but of the Government or the local authority. That is why the comparison was made, and it was seen to be different when the previous Government drew up their rules for special advisers. It is the natural comparison.<br><br>
In many of the submissions which I received, the parallel between the two was drawn. People said that if they are in central government on those terms, would it not be reasonable to have them in local government. That argument swayed me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot compare local government with the Civil Service. He must accept that a person who applies for certain types of job will be politically active—he has to be, or he would not apply for the job—and if he is politically active, he will obviously be active for the party which appoints him. There is no point in appointing someone who is not on the same side. That would be crazy.<br><br>
The Minister is encouraging political activitists to come forward to be political advisers, but discouraging them by saying that they can be appointed as political advisers but can no longer participate politically. That seems absolutely crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it seems as crazy as that, it is odd that the Labour Government made precisely that decision about special advisers who are politically active and chosen because they advise Ministers. These regulations are like those which were endorsed by the Labour Government. We have not invented them. The hon. Gentleman must accept that, in this, if in nothing else, the two are precisely parallel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not like that, but the submissions which I received from his party suggested that they were precisely parallel. The hon. Gentleman must accept that many people in the Labour party submitted to the Government that, if Ministers have special advisers, so should local authorities. The analogy was drawn by Labour Members. The rules that I suggest were, I believe, written by the previous Labour Government. They certainly endorsed them when they started to have special advisers.<br><br>
Now that I have been converted to the argument, it is hard to be told that I am being outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is misleading the Committee.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not say that. I may be saying something with which the hon. Gentleman disagrees, but that is not necessarily misleading the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we have it clearly on the record that the submissions made by my hon. Friends and I on behalf of the main opposition party said, that, as there were political advisers in central government, it would be unthinkable to exclude them from local government? The Minister accepted our argument.<br><br>
We never suggested that regulations should exclude political advisers from taking part in political activity outside their jobs. I do not want to labour the point because there are many other important issues to be discussed.<br><br>
Incidentally, I also want to put on record the fact that the Heath Government drew up the regulations. If carrying them through is endorsing them, the Minister has a point in terms of the previous Labour Government. However, I remember that the adviser of the now deputy leader of the Labour party became chair of a local Labour party organisation, so I shall investigate the Minister's remarks in greater depth.<br><br>
We are worried that the Minister is suggesting that someone in this position, and by analogy in other positions, would undertake his political activity in his work time rather than in his spare time. There is a crucial difference there on which we need the Minister to comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that he made submissions. I was referring to all the submissions that we received. I hope that I have made it clear that I accept the parallel between special advisers in local government and special advisers to Ministers.<br><br>
Now that Opposition Members have won their case, it is hard that they say, "Ah, we meant the parallel to go only as far as this. We did not expect anyone to impose on special advisers to local government the conditions that we thought were reasonable for special advisers to Ministers when we were in power. We don't think those terms are reasonable for local government."<br><br>
I do not remember reading a submission that said, "There is a parallel but, if we have special advisers in local government, they should not be subject to the restrictions upon which we insisted for special advisers to central government", but I will check with my officials. If people win their case, it is churlish for them to say, "But we did not mean it to operate like that. We meant something different." The submissions did not make that suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the way in which the Minister in pursuing the issue. He said that there must be a division between people who the public approach for impartial advice and advisers who are politically motivated. If a person is appointed as a political adviser, the public know before they go to him or her that that person is not impartial. The Minister is twisting what happens.<br><br>
A special adviser to a Minister is completely different from a political adviser in local government. The salaries are different and the patronage that follows is different. We must get the record straight. Special advisers in central government and local advisers in local government are totally different. By trying to compare the two, the Minister is misleading the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I cannot compare the two, I had better withdraw the suggestion that there should be special advisers in local government. The proposal was made precisely because the two can be compared. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) says what he does because he realises, I think, that his argument does not stand up. He may wish to go on to something else, but he raised the matter and I think that I ought to give an explanation.<br><br>
The connection was almost universally made in the submissions put to me, and I have admitted that I was swayed by them. It is true that one reason why I feel that twin-tracking should be abolished is that people do not believe that they are receiving impartial advice from an officer who claims to be independent when he is a party political figure elsewhere. I do not apply that argument here, though, and I think that the hon. Member for Normanton would agree that I have not adduced it in support of what I am saying now.<br><br>
I am suggesting that a different matter is at issue here. The issue is whether local people would be happy about paying a person appointed by a political group but acting outside the local authority—as for example, a prospective parliamentary or local government candidate or the chairman of a major fund-raising committee—for doing that other job. I also said that, even if that did not happen, we thought, as I am sure did those who drew up the rules for special advisers to Ministers that it would be better if there were no such clash.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton said that the local authority might lay down its own regulations, but it is often most difficult to deal with local rules when there are local examples which are party political. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that it would be easy for Carrick district council to make a decision in the case of somebody whom it employed? I think that it is much harder to make a decision in those circumstances, and to do so entirely impartially. Making, and being seen to make, an entirely impartial decision is very difficult.<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Normanton knows that Ministers are provided with notes as to how they should conduct themselves. A key sentence which civil servants put says that Ministers should not conduct themselves in a way which might be thought to be unacceptable. In other words, it is not a case of whether it is unacceptable but whether it is thought to be unacceptable. No doubt Labour and Conservative Ministers have done things which we find unacceptable. We can argue about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will tell me whether he thinks that holding a post paid by the Government and being chairman of the Conservative party falls into that category?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can no doubt carry on discussions about that, but if he had waited for a moment, he would have heard me say that I have no doubt that people have thought many times that Labour and Conservative Ministers have not kept to that guidance. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman's example falls into that category, but that is only my opinion. I am merely saying that there is a long-standing view in Government which might be called the Caesar's wife's view, if that is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0491">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
a sexist phrase—perhaps we should say Caesar's partner's view. The concept is that those involved in government must not put themselves, or others, into an embarrassing position—their position should be clear from the outset.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about a matter that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) raised—what a special adviser does in his or her time off. The Minister appears to be implying that if special advisers do party-political work in their time off, ratepayers will feel that they are paying for people to participate in party politics. Is that what the Minister is suggesting? I cannot understand how people could believe that they are paying for party-political activity undertaken in a person's spare time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parallel is exact. The Labour Government decided that the people of Tottenham would have thought it odd if the Conservative candidate was at the same time special adviser to a Minister. It was thought that the ratepayers would not consider it appropriate for him to be paid for a political job—that is the function of a special adviser—and to be a prospective parliamentary candidate.<br><br>
I am surprised that this argument has been advanced, because both sides of the House hold similar views about special advisers to Government. Similarly, in a local authority, a ratepayer might ask, "Why has this person been chosen to be the special adviser to the local Conservative authority? Could it be that he wants to live and work in the area to be the prospective Conservative Parliamentary candidate? Has he been appointed for that reason or for the job that the council pay him to do?" The proposal was introduced to avoid such conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be weird and wonderful people who believe that someone is paid to do political work. The remedy in the case that the Minister cited, would be for local councillors to raise the matter in a political forum and ask the chief executive precisely what were his activities and whether at the time in question he was being paid by the local authority. It is not an issue to be dealt with by the law because it can be resolved easily by asking straightforward questions, which is what people are entitled to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that were the case, I am surprised that it was not thought to be so by the Labour Government. Many local authorities have huge budgets—some are larger than those of Ministries—and there is no reason why a comparison should not be drawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister repeatedly refers to special advisers to Ministers. Will he say more precisely why he believes that it is not correct for Opposition members of the Committee to draw a parallel with researchers who work for hon. Members? Some are paid out of a Member's personal allowance and others, such as those who work for Opposition Front Bench spokesmen, are paid out of Short money. There is no suggestion that those researchers should be restricted in this way.<br><br>
Our staff are employed through parliamentary offices and their salaries are paid by the Fees Office. We have powers to hire and fire them and to direct their actions, but that is equally true of special advisers.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The parallel with the special adviser is closer than that with staff of Members of Parliament. The parallel was impressed upon me by impartial submissions. I was assured that that was the best ground on which to change the government's mind.<br><br>
Special advisers to Ministers are employed by the Government as civil servants, and local government officers are employed by the local authority. A research asssistant to a Member of Parliament is not employed as a civil servant. His contract of employment is with that Member, not with the House of Commons or with the Government. He may be paid by the Fees Office, but that is for the Member's convenience. A Member of Parliament may employ him personally and directly if he can show the Fees Office that the money claimed for that employee is used for that purpose. Many hon. Members make their own arrangements because they find it more convenient, especially if the researcher is employed for only a short time.<br><br>
The special adviser has a clear role in national or local government whereas the role of a Member of Parliament's researcher is to assist that Member of Parliament and his constituents. A special adviser in the local authority works as a local government officer with other local government officers. The local residents know that he is a local government employee. When the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) was research assistant to his predecessor, local people knew that he was not a civil servant or paid by the Government. He was the very respected Member's personal assistant. That role is different from that of a special adviser to a Minister or to a local government committee. My parallel is closer than the hon. Gentleman's and the Committee should reject the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I return to the matter of special advisers. As leader of Haringey council, I appointed special advisers on party political grounds. They were then responsible to the chief executive, or another local government officer who was responsible for their hours of work and holidays, for example, because they could not report on a daily basis to the leader of the council. Therefore, there is a clear differentiation between giving political advice to the majority party and reporting to the chief executive for hours of work, flexitime, time off and so on.<br><br>
Given that position, I do not understand how the Minister can say that a member of the public will believe that that adviser, in his or her spare time, is being paid by the local authority. There is a clear distinction between the political role and the hours of work for that individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two reasons why the public can make that mistake. First, if that person worked for the Knowsley borough council, we gather that he may well be allowed two and half days paid leave a week to take part in party-political acitvities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was arguing that a person responsible to the chief executive was a local government officer and came under the same regulations as a local government officer, and that must be so. If he were allowed two and a half days paid leave—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the leader of the council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right, as the leader of the council. The ratepayers in Knowsley would ask, "Why was the leader of the council appointed as the political adviser to the Labour group on Knowsley council? Was it to give advice to the Labour group or to ensure that the electors of Knowsley paid for his living expenses while he spent two and half days a week working for the local authority?"<br><br>
Secondly, if he had no time off and carried on his other activities in his own time, the question still remains, "Was he chosen by the London borough of Hackney—Labour or Conservative group—as an adviser because he was the right person to advise, or was the opportunity taken to give him a reason to move into the area to play a part in party politics?" Although the appointment may be above board, it is better for that question not to be asked in the second instance and, in the first instance, it is justifiable to suggest that in those circumstances the individual was a half-time political adviser and a half-time political activist with his whole time being paid for by the ratepayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister accepts that if someone is using time for which he is paid by the council to campaign politically in any sense for the party rather than following the direction of his group, that would be gross misconduct and no Committee Member would support that because it would be misuse of ratepayers' money.<br><br>
Other rules cover that issue, however. The Widdicombe Committee report stated that the wrong use of time by councillors who are also local authority employees should be covered elsewhere, as it is in the Bill. Surely the real question arises from use of time outside that which is paid? The Minister believes that a small number of people may regard that as improper but surely the Minister's role, and that of hon. Members, is to defend individuals and say that it is legitimate freedom in a democracy to campaign and do what a person believes is worth doing rather than to enshrine in law the prejudice of some individuals who clearly cannot distinguish between what somebody is paid to do, quite rightly, the proper conduct of that paid time and what they do in their own free time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not right in the first instance. I was not suggesting that someone did other work in his employer's time without his permission. I hope the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) will not feel that I was taking that line. He gave an example—I realised that it was restricted to leaders of neighbouring authorities, but other periods, such as one day a week for members, were mentioned. I was saying that as those involved are local government employees, they would come under the same arrangements that obtain for other local government employees. Special advisers to Ministers would, if there were not special arrangements for them, come under the same regulations that obtain for civil servants because they are civil servants.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Truro is pressing the exactitude of the comparison. If we did not do this, a Conservative local authority, for example, which allowed its local government officers time off to be members of another council would give that time off in the same way as they would to any other local government officer.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
Although the Bill restricts the time off to a reasonable amount, there is no doubt that we are still allowing individuals to have time off. I do not think that the hon. Member for Truro would be very happy if instead of being the hon. Member for Truro he was the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, and he discovered that the Southwark Labour party had taken on a political adviser, who was a local government officer, and that that officer was given a day a week off to be a local councillor over the border in Lambeth, and was also campaigning through the local newspaper, which covered both areas, on party political activities. If the hon. Gentleman discovered that while he was locked up in committees on local government and housing the political adviser was attacking him as the sitting Member in his capacity as a local government councillor and not as a political adviser, he, the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey, would feel miffed that part of the cost of the campaign was borne by the ratepayers who, in another capacity, he represented.<br><br>
I would wish to protect the hon. Gentleman from an embarrassing position in which neither he nor his opponent should be. It is better for his opponent to do another job and fight him hard in Bermondsey and, perhaps, win.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has built his argument with the emphasis on the impartiality of the advice. Special advisers are different because we do not expect them to give impartial advice. If the Minister is pressing the analogy with the Civil Service, is he prepared to press it even further? For example, does the Minister not find it objectionable that the person appointed to chair the Leeds western health authority has sought nomination as a Conservative candidate? He is a well-known press and radio personality in the city. Do the Leeds ratepayers and taxpayers not justifiably feel that they are funding someone's election campaign? Would the Minister not also apply the same rules to the appointees of the urban development corporation, some of whom are in the same position and funded by Government money for their spare time activities, who seek and court press and public information? What is the Minister's response? The Minister would get a different response from us if he were to say that he would also outlaw those examples. If not, there seems to be some selectivity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must answer this question carefully. I would take the same view about the chairman of the health authority—[Hon. Members: "Ah!"] If hon. Members will take the time to listen, they will find that I take the view that I took when the previous chairman of the East Anglian regional health authority, who was the nominee of the previous Labour Government, was retained by this Government. I thought the way in which he conducted himself was perfectly proper and no questions were raised. But we are not talking about chairmen of health authorities—[Hon. Members: "Why not?"] There is no amendment about chairmen of health authorities, but there is an amendment about special advisers in local authorities. I have been accused of drawing too close a parallel between special advisers to Ministers and special advisers to party-political groups. Surely the parallel between special advisers in local government and chairmen of health authorities is much wider; they are wholly different.<br><br>
I shall finish my reply to the hon. Member for Truro. This is not the most crucial part of the Bill, but it is better to err on the side of clarity and have it clearly understood
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0493">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
that someone chosen as a special adviser to the local authority party group should be seen as being chosen for that job. It makes the person's job easier; it makes the officials' job easier; it stops unfounded and unacceptable attacks from people outside; and it raises the good name of local government. That is why, on balance, I prefer to keep it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why is there no appeal here? Can the Minister be more precise about the range of activities of this political adviser? The impartiality of an officer who is not appointed politically is one thing; when he is working in a way that is clearly political, there appears to be a difficulty of interpretation. Let me give two examples. The first one involves the political adviser to the Foreign Secretary, Robin Harris, who put himself forward as prospective parliamentary candidate for Tooting. He engaged in the process of being selected as a candidate while still a political adviser. That appears to conflict with what the Minister said.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the case of Mr. Kerpel, the adviser to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who wrote to argue, in connection with the investigation into Camden council, in favour of surcharging Labour councillors. He wrote that on the Secretary of State's headed paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting into a bad habit of making speeches in the form of interventions. I must be firmer with the Committee and insist that interventions must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his first example, as the hon. Gentleman knows, regulations lay down that if someone is selected as a prospective parliamentary candidate, he must resign as a special adviser. That is what happened, and that is what I have in mind here.<br><br>
I do not know the full details of the second example that the hon. Gentleman gave, but if I remember rightly, the action was taken in connection with circumstances that had arisen before he was a political adviser, but he was at that stage a councillor on the council about which the matter arose. The matter involved people's good name, in that there was a question of being surcharged. That has no bearing on the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Prior to his appointment, Mr. Kerpel was leader of the Conservative group on the council.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On both counts, one has to make sure that the burdens are not too onerous, and that is what I hope to do. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Tottenham may laugh, but regulations have been laid down by his party as well as by my party, and both parties have sought to ensure that the burdens are not onerous. I shall be happy to look into any aspects of local government where individual special advisers find the arrangements too onerous. If the hon. Member for Truro wishes to make changes later, for instance, about hours off, I am open to his proposals. I have no intention of being extreme, and if he can produce an alternative I shall be perfectly happy to consider it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, leave out lines 24 to 29.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it may be convenient to take the following amendments: </span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 27, in line 24, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 29.</p>
<p>No. 32, in line 40, leave out subsection (2).</p>
<p>No. 34, in line 47, leave out from "1973" to end of line 49.</p>
<p>No. 12, in page 4, line 1, leave out subsection (3).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment flows from the concern that I have already expressed about the restrictions, and the breadth of the definition of them, in clause 2(3). The definition will include anyone who comes into contact with the press and the public or who gives advice to members of the authority.<br><br>
The definitions in clause 2(3) are open to massive interpretation difficulties by the local authority and could result in a serious abuse of the right of individuals to express their views. It is extraordinarily difficult to know who will be affected. The Minister may respond, as he tended to respond in our earlier debates, by arguing that it is a matter for the local authority, but as he has said, it is a power that the local authority already has. The Bill attempts to legislate quite specifically for that, saying that there should be a list, and that the list should be drawn up on the basis of the Minister's list of categories in the Bill. He said earlier that he did not wish to add to that list, so we are left with an enormously wide definition.<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) was right to say previously that although it might be assumed that individuals affected could go for judicial review, the definitions in the Bill are so broad that it would be difficult for anyone to win such a case. The likelihood is that it will affect junior staff who are unable to appeal because they earn less than £13,500 but who, for many other reasons, come into the category. I could give many examples, but let us consider the case of a junior member of the press department. He is probably responsible for taking press cuttings, faxing out material that others have prepared, and dealing with routine inquiries. Is he acting on behalf of the authority on a regular basis? Does the Minister believe that this rather vague definition should apply, for example, to everyone in the press department of a local authority?<br><br>
Most local authority groups called for clearer definitions, and while that is catered for in a Civil Service code of conduct, which contains much more specific definitions and also, of course, the right of appeal, the Government appear to be unable to propose something similar for local authorities. There is a parallel with cases in the intermediate category in a Civil Service case. Clearly, it will not apply to chiefs and deputies, because they are catered for elsewhere in the Bill. Neither will it apply to those covered by the Widdicombe proposals, which are based not on principal officers but on salary, and will cover 70,000 or 90,000 employees. In fact, the Widdicombe report specifically sought to restrict the activities of what it called senior officers, who are defined as those at the rank of principal officer and above who
<br><blockquote><p>"advise councillors … and … adjudicate on matters of propriety"</p></blockquote>
and who were
<br><blockquote><p>"routinely involved in advice to elected members."</p></blockquote>
The Widdicombe report sought to narrow restrictions as far as possible and the clause seeks to broaden them. In effect, it covers anyone that a local authority wishes to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
cover without the individual having a right of appeal. If that is comparable to anything in the Civil Service code, it is comparable only to those in the intermediate category who have well-defined rights of appeal and have used them effectively.<br><br>
A recent editorial in <i>The Independent</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Political activity can vary from discreetly stuffing envelopes to flamboyantly standing for public office, and the vast majority of the 70,000 affected by the Bill are people performing uncontentious tasks who should not have their civil liberties eroded."</p></blockquote>
That applies even more to those who are covered by the clause, which was not a recommendation of the Widdicombe report. It comes from the White Paper's recommendations which were to replace what the Widdicombe report, proposed for principal officers. Now we seem to have the worst of both worlds—the £13,500 restriction and the proposals in the White Paper.<br><br>
The provision is unnecessary. It is far too wide and, in terms of the Widdicombe report and most people's views, it should not be in the Bill. If the Minister feels that a few people are not covered by the £13,500 rule, he must define them infinitely more precisely. That is the general view of those whose responses I have received.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept that this is not an attempt to destroy the purpose of the clause or the Minister's objectives. It is merely a correct and reasonable response to what was, after all, the view of the Widdicombe Committee which considered these issues in great depth initially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall go through the various categories and explain why I am unhappy about the amendment.<br><br>
There is a series of jobs about which, by common consent—even among members of the Committee—people have doubt. It is a close-run question whether their holders should be allowed to twin-track. We are talking of principal officers, as the hon. Member for Truro knows. Perhaps he does not think that it is a good thing for a principal officers to be chief executive. Perhaps we are at one there.<br><br>
It has been suggested that a local authority would make a list of those whom it felt were in the category described in the Bill. We felt that this was right, and, because we wanted to give clear and careful opportunities for appeal to people who were barred by what, inevitably, is the arbitrary line that is drawn either by the term "principal officer" or the nearest we could get to it—the salary—we thought it sensible for the local authority, in the first instance, to define what jobs that it thought would be incompatible. Our guidelines have some flexibility. The local authority would be able to make its list of employees whom it thought fitted.<br><br>
A few of those people might hold humbler positions that principal officers or those with a salary of £13,500. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that part of the reason is that some—especially in small district councils, for example—will have close associations with local people. I must tread carefully here. I was thinking of people involved in the allocation of council houses, for example, who might not be highly paid, but who might be extremely sensitive in a way the hon. Gentleman understands. His constituency is not unlike mine in that it has small villages, and arguments about allocations are politically very sharp, and amount to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
sharp village politics in the real sense. It is possible that a local authority would think that certain individuals came into that category.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene so early. I accept that certain people can be immensely more powerful than the chief executive in local people's eyes. I mean people who allocate houses and those who decide whether repairs will be carried out. Holders of both positions can be regarded as immensely influential in individuals' lives.<br><br>
Does the Minister accept that it will be difficult for the local authority—which will know the person in question—to draw up rules? In doing so it would be difficult for an authority not to bear in mind persons whose political role was well known. For example, it would be difficult for a Liberal-run local authority to think hard about the vociferous activities of the Conservative local authority's employee, who might also be a chairman of the branch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. It is therefore a matter of balancing two difficulties. If that is not done, the decision has to be put the other way round—in the hands of an adjudicator—for employees who are above a certain grade. I am not sure what could satisfactorily be done about those below it, who in some areas and circumstances might be keen to be considered. I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I felt that on balance the best way was to tell a local authority that it must make up its own mind and to give it guidelines.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Truro is right to say that the guidelines will be considered differently in each area. That will be reasonable because authorities differ, as do circumstances, places and people's sensitivities. It is better to let local authorities decide.<br><br>
As to other categories—I apoligise for the vulgar way of saying it: the £13,500 barrier—we cannot specify "principal officer" because local authorities use the term in different ways. Ours is the nearest interpretation that we know of what the Widdicombe Committee meant by "principal officer".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no use in the hon. Gentleman saying no from a sedentary position. When I talked to members of the Widdicombe Committee, I asked whether there was a better way of meeting the point. If the hon. Gentleman has found a better way of defining that group of employees, I shall be happy to consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to grasp something that the Minister said, which may be important. He spoke of the adjudicator possibly having a role, and said that it would be difficult to cover so many cases. The Minister then suggested that only a small number of people would come below the £13,500 category. I am not clear about why such people need a right of appeal, given that they can be well known to a small local authority, and can be politically active and well known for it, or politically influential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although there are very few, they are very few among many, so they have to be identified. It is not always right to concentrate on those who currently are involved in political activity. We are talking not of individuals, but of a local authority drawing up a list of jobs that it would regard as falling within categories. To take my earlier example of someone in a lowly-paid job and tenants in council houses wondering how they might get repairs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
done, or get a house, a local authority might consider that that should be covered, and wish to include it. But would it not be odd? It would mean that if an authority wrote such a requirement into a person's conditions of service, there would be no appeal because it could do that anyway under ordinary common arrangements. If it were done as the Bill proposes, there would be an appeal. However, as we are merely including provision in law for what can be done by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
local authorities of their own volition anyway, the idea of an appeal in one case but not in the other, when there is in both instances an appeal to judicial review—which is to say that such an appeal would be improper—is, I think—</span></p>
