<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government and Housing Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. A problem has arisen—we are puzzled by some of the groupings of amendments. I wanted to ask for two of them to be changed, but I understand that that might cause difficulty.<br><br>
Amendment No. 455 appears under schedule 4 but, as it deals with rent rebates which are dealt with by clause 70, it should appear under that clause and stand on its own. The amendment, which appears on page 351 of the Amendment Paper, proposes that subsection (1) of clause 70 be omitted. It is not an amendment to the schedule, so I am puzzled why it appears under the schedule.<br><br>
Secondly, amendment No. 437 appears under clause 64. I believe that it should be considered under clause 65, separately or with the other amendments selected for debate under that clause. Amendment No. 437, which appears on page 346 of the amendment paper, refers to clause 65, page 69, line 17. It proposes to insert a new subsection into clause 65, so it belongs with the group of amendments under that clause.<br><br>
After a hasty conversation before the start of today's proceedings, it seems that both changes should be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to help if I can. Provided that it is procedurally possible, I shall accommodate the request of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). We can have further discussions during the proceedings today and, if it is necessary to amend my selection, I shall ensure that that is done to try to meet the hon. Gentleman's representations.</span></p>

DUTY TO KEEP HOUSING REVENUE ACCOUNT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 425, in page 67, line 34, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() This section shall have effect for the purpose of the regulation of the housing finances of a local housing authority.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 426, in page 67, line 34, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() This section shall have effect for the purpose of securing that rent payable by the tenants of a local housing authority is no more than is reasonably necessary to meet the costs arising in the housing revenue account of the authority.'.</p></blockquote>
No. 428, in page 67, line 34, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() This section shall have effect for the purpose of regulating the keeping of the housing finances of a local housing authority.'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>() Notwithstanding the provisions of this Part, nothing in this Part shall be taken to empower the Secretary of State to take account of:
<ol>
<li>the rent payable by tenants of a local housing authority before the commencement of this Part; or</li>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 826</span>
<li>the difference between the rent payable by the tenants of a local housing authority and the rent payable by the tenants of another local housing authority;</li></ol>
in exercising his powers and duties under this Part.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 430, in page 68, line 43, leave out from 'Account' to end of line 45.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of the Bill. The amendments deal with affordable rents, historic costs, comparison of local authority rent levels and the housing revenue account. I make no bones about the fact that we attach great importance to these matters, which involve the Government's philosophy on rents, what the Government believe those rents are, what they are in reality, and their impact on the people who are paying them.<br><br>
The central failure of the Government's policy on housing is not simply the lack of good housing provision in the public sector, but their failure to revive the private rented sector, as they promised to do many years ago. They have failed to do that and there is no evidence that it is reviving, despite the changes that they have made since 1980. All the evidence suggests that it is still declining.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see how the hon. Gentleman can expect such a dramatic change in direction, given that the 1988 Act came into force only last December. The Government accept that there were certain constraints on the private sector's resuscitation, and I should have thought that the Act's specific proposals created the means whereby the private rented sector could be revived. Given that it is now April, only four months after that Bill became law, I cannot see how the hon. Gentleman can expect such a dramatic change in policy to have taken effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister was not responsible for the 1980 Act, or some of those that followed. But you may recall, Mr. Hunt, that Ministers have argued since then that the 1980 Act would help to revive the private rented sector. The Minister will I think agree that, whatever else is true, that has not happened. The private rented sector has continued to decline.<br><br>
The central argument for these amendments is that if the Minister believes that the 1988 Act will work, it can only do so if rents rise to market levels and eviction is made easier, so that landlords can re-let or sell properties. That is what is behind the 1988 Act. It makes eviction easier and allows for market rents. But the Government's confusion has become apparent since the Act was passed. They are no longer sure, as they were beforehand, whether they actually want market rents.<br><br>
Three phrases have been used by the Government from time to time—market rents, affordable rents, and, occasionally, fair rents—none of which has ever been defined. They have actually refused to define a market rent, although that is the easiest to define. It is simply what the market will bear. Nobody should dispute that—least of all a Government who claim to live and die by the market, and may die soon. The argument is clear. We are moving towards market rents, and people are suffering because of that.<br><br>
Homeless households have increased from 53,110 in 1975 to 118,710 in 1987. If my memory serves me right, the figure for 1188 is about 199,000. There has been a continuing increase in homeless families. But perhaps the most awful aspect of homelessness, apart from the horror
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0876">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 827</span>
of bed and breakfast for so many families, is what we see on our streets—not just in London and elsewhere in Britain, but in our rural areas and small country towns. We see young, middle-aged and even older people sitting or standing on the corner of a street and holding up a notice saying "Homeless and hungry."<br><br>
The day before yesterday, I was on the south bank of the river, then on the north side, near Charing Cross, and in my constituency, Hammersmith. In only two or three hours I saw two youngsters and one middle-aged man all holding a cardboard sign of that type and begging, with their hats or some other container on the ground. I never thought that I would live to see the day when I would see people begging in the street like that.<br><br>
That is what makes me so angry with this Government. It has never happened before, under Labour or Tory Governments, except by alcoholics, some of the recovering mentally ill or drug addicts. If the hon. Gentleman does not believe that I do not know what land he has been living in but never in my lifetime have I seen ordinary men, women and children begging in the streets of this country as they do now. They are not recovering mentally ill people, alcoholics or drug addicts but people with a straightforward problem called homelessness. That is the most damning indictment of the failure of the Government's housing policy and the moral flaw that lies at the heart of Conservative philosophy.<br><br>
It is sometimes said that a problem for Socialists is how to ensure a more equal distribution of power and wealth without having a fairly paternalistic society, but that pales into insignificance when compared with the Conservative philosophy which says that it is all right for a flat in the Strand to be offered on the market at a rent of £1 million a year while homeless children are on the streets. That marks the central failure of Conservative philosophy, the Bill, the Housing Act 1988 and the Government's housing policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with amazement to the hon. Gentleman, who has claimed that there were no problems of homelessness under the previous Labour Government. When I was leader of the Conservative opposition on the London borough of Lewisham there were 2,000 empty council properties but people were being put into bed-and-breakfast accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that we have never had begging in the streets by ordinary people as a result of homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes we have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not true. It is no use the hon. Gentleman talking about empty council houses and bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Yes, there has been a problem with bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but ever since the introduction of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 the problem of homelessness was tackled by the Labour Government and in most areas of the country the rate was going down. The unique aspect of the Government's policy is that it has been going up consistently.<br><br>
When I was a probation officer before I came to the House in 1979, I could find any homeless person who came to me a place to stay for the night, and I did so frequently. Furthermore, the police in the House of Commons still ask me on occasions to find accommodation for homeless
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 828</span>
people who turn up here, but I can no longer find them anywhere to stay. When I telephone Centrepoint and various other organisations, no beds are available. If the hon. Gentleman does not believe me, he can check on what I say. That is the cruel truth and he and the philosophy of his party are responsible for it. He cannot duck that responsibility because that is the reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has conveniently ignored, not only in this debate but on past occasions when we have discussed housing, the report that has been made available to the Department of the Environment and I assume has been read by all members of the Committee and others. It was produced by Professor Maclennan. Admittedly, it contained a number of references to the fact that there was no crisis in housing at that time, but it made the point, which was subsequently endorsed by the Audit Commission, that there was unmistakably a direct correlation between the number of empties, their slow turn-round time and the number of homeless people.<br><br>
Furthermore, the hon. Gentleman seemed to link the figure compiled by local authorities of registered homeless people, which was 118,000 at the last count, to the people on the streets who he has described. He is giving the impression that those 118,000 registered homeless people are without roofs over their heads, and that is manifestly untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I clearly pointed out the difference between the problem of homeless families, which was my first point, and what is marked in my notes as "point B" which is about homeless people on the streets. I am utterly amazed that the Minister had the audacity to quote the Glasgow report because it said that local authorities were good managers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes it did. The overall judgment of the report was that local authorities were good managers, on a par with housing associations. In some areas they were better and in one or two worse. Did that report not confirm that housing associations and local authorities both come out as basically good managers, with some failures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that Professor Maclennan said that, in certain instances, local authorities are very good at housing management; he also referred to good management in housing associations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot get away with the wide generalisation that Professor Maclennan's report was not an indictment of the inadequate housing management of a number of local authorities. As I develop my argument, the hon. Gentleman will hear me say that criticism of the housing management of local authorities is not widespread, but that a considerable number of authorities are not up to scratch.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is grudging with his compliments to local authorities. Any fair-minded person who read Professor Maclennan's report would know that local authorities come out of it well. Bearing in mind the fact that the Government have been undermining and demoralising local authorities for 10 years, one could say that they come out brilliantly.<br><br>
Compared with housing associations, local authorities come out very well, yet the Minister intends to impose on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0877">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 829</span>
housing associations not only the burden of building and supplying more houses—which we all want—but also the burden of taking over local authority housing. He is doing that when his Department's report shows that housing associations' management of stock is neither better nor worse than that of local authorities.<br><br>
What the Minister should ask himself is why the Government are such appalling managers of their housing. Why have the Government more empty properties than any other owner—even the private sector? The private sector has more empty properties than housing associations or councils, but the Government have even more. Why?<br><br>
If the Minister can spare the time during our lunch break, I can take him five or six miles from the House to see houses and flats in good condition—with four or five bedrooms, and gardens—which have been empty for up to nine years. They are owned by the Home Office. They are about to be demolished. They were about to be demolished five years ago. We are now told that it will be done in a couple of years. What are those houses to make way for? Car parking and landscaping—when those homeless people are on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, rather like the second-hand car salesman, is changing subjects. He was finding it a bit difficult when we were talking about homelessness. He is concentrating on the problem in London. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that Professor Maclennan and his team from Glasgow university got no co-operation whatever from the London boroughs. They could not therefore be the subject of that review. The hon. Gentleman chooses to ignore that fact, yet the greatest concentration of homelessness is in London. What does the hon. Gentleman say about the London boroughs' refusal to co-operate with Professor Maclennan?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The London boroughs have been happy to co-operate in any number of studies on the homeless. The Minister knows that. What is unacceptable about the Minister's approach is that he is constantly on the defensive. He is trying to defend a Government with an indefensible record. This is not just a problem for London. As I said, it is found all over the country; in rural as well as urban areas. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson), who is not present this morning—no doubt with good reason—has been complaining about homelessness also. It is no good the Minister being constantly on the defensive unless he can demonstrate that the Goverment are turning the problem round and taking some emergency action to deal with the real crisis in the streets. I repeat that the unique difference between this Government and every preceding Government since the end of the second world-war—Labour and Tory—is that they dealt with the problem of homelessness and slowly made improvements. This Goverment, uniquely, are making the problem worse. No one can deny that the number has been increasing dramatically, whereas under previous Governments it was diminishing. The Government cannot wriggle out of that.<br><br>
Homelessness is the sharp end of the problem, which includes arrears on home loans. Arrears of between six and 12 months have risen from approximately 14,500 to approximately 47,000 during the past 10 to 12 years. During the same period, local authority rent arrears have increased. At one time, the Government were jumping up and down and saying, "Look at all the local authority rent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 830</span>
arrears." What happened then? The primary reason for that was the housing benefit cuts, although management was part of the reason. The Government do not believe us, but housing association rent arrears have also risen. Have the housing associations suddenly become inefficient also? Is it again someone else's fault and not that of the Government? The fault is obvious. It is the cut in housing benefit—not the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or even the seventh cut, but the eighth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the unkindest cut of all that housing arrears in Barking and Dagenham, where there are many council houses, account for 8 per cent. of council house rents, whereas rent arrears in Brent account for 100 per cent. and in Southwark costs now stand at £53 million? The hon. Gentleman must accept that many boroughs do not collect their council house rents and rates properly. The same benefit arrangements operate in those boroughs as in neighbouring boroughs that collect rents and rates. Many badly run Labour councils do not collect rents and they penalise those who pay. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is doing the Committee and the nation a disservice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The unkindest cut of all affects old-age pensioners. I shall give an example. Some, who used to be in GLC seaside homes, now pay 40 per cent. of their net weekly income in rent as a result of Government policy. The unkindest cut of all came from the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment and Lord Caithness when they said that the taxpayer should not subsidise a spare room. They are prepared to subsidise their own spare rooms. Everyone who owns his home receives a subsidy on spare rooms. Why is the Minister for Local Government, whose head is now buried in a book, prepared to accept that owner-occupiers may have a subsidy and get into arrears—it is acceptable if those arrears rise—but it is not acceptable for the arrears of those who pay rent to rise. The Government's only answer, as they say in the 1988 Act, is that if people have arrears of rent for three months, they are moved out automatically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman now answer the question? Why do many Labour boroughs in London fail to collect rents, when other Labour boroughs collect them and the same benefit arrangements apply? The fact is that, sometimes, they do not even want to collect rents, and that damages their decent tenants. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why that happens in Brent and Southwark?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is doing the same as his hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. The Minister is trying to avoid the central failure of the Government's policy. It cannot be explained by the activities of one, two, three, four or five councils. Homelessness and rent arrears are increasing throughout the country under this Government. It did not happen under the previous Conservative Government. What is the difference?<br><br>
Some local authorities, including Tory authorities, are less effective managers than others. I suspect that most of the inefficient authorities are Tory, but that is not important to the debate. The Government are ducking the fact that arrears have been increasing across the board for housing association tenants, private tenants, public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0878">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 831</span>
tenants and even for people paying mortgages because subsidies have been directed towards the better off and away from tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If anyone is dodging the issue it is the hon. Member for Hammersmith. He has got himself into considerable difficulty although we have been debating the issue for only 20 minutes.<br><br>
Can I extract from him some acceptance that a number of Labour-controlled authorities are grossly inefficient at collecting rents, and that they are not confined to London? During a debate on the Floor of the House, I told the hon. Gentleman about my exchange with councillor Keva Coombes, the leader of Liverpool, after we had announced the worst offenders. He pleasantly surprised me by saying that the authority had been grossly inefficient. I will send the hon. Gentleman a transcript of that radio exchange if he so wishes. Councillor Coombes accepted that the authority had been inefficient at rent collection and said that he was prepared to threaten eviction unless the record was improved. He accepted the Government's proposals. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that inefficiency exists?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can wriggle and twist as much as he likes, but the central question is one for him to answer. Why is it that, under this Government—not even under previous Tory Governments and certainly not under previous Labour Governments—the problem has got worse? Will the Minister follow the suggestion of the Southwark district auditor and enable Southwark to write off rent arrears? The Minister complains about London boroughs. Will he support the district auditor?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to hear what the Audit Commission has to say before I reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commission has already reported. I ask the Minister again whether he is prepared to support the recommendations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No responsible Government would write off arrears at the stroke of a pen. That would be irresponsible and would adversely affect people in the area who have kept their rent payments up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now we have the Minister caught. He admits that the Government are irresponsible. Before the Government sold industries to the private sector they wrote off debts worth hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, but they cannot do the same for tenants. Oh no, under this Government tenants are second-class citizens, irrespective of whether they are public tenants, private tenants or housing association tenants. People can have their private rooms subsidised if they own their houses, as the Minister does, but not if they are tenants.<br><br>
During a previous sitting, I asked the Minister at about one o'clock in the morning how many spare rooms he had in his house, how many people occupied it and how much subsidy he had received from the taxpayer. He refused to answer. He said, "The question is not relevant to me because I don't get housing benefit." He would if he were a tenant, except that as soon as it became known that he had a spare room, his housing benefit would be cut. That is what the question has to do with him; that is what it has to do with morality.<br><br>
If it is fair for someone who owns his house to receive a subsidy on a spare room—I accept that it is fair—it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 832</span>
also fair for someone who rents his house to receive a subsidy for a spare room, whether that person is a private or public sector tenant. That is what the Government cannot accept. They cannot accept that tenants are anything other than second-class citizens.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith seems to be suggesting—I find the suggestion quite scurrilous—that the Government should write off the debts that have arisen as a result of rent arrears. What kind of signal would that send to council tenants in all boroughs—not just in London—in connection with the prompt payment of their rents? Surely the implication is that it does not really matter whether they pay their rents on time because the rents will be written off by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is the answer that the Government themselves have given on many occasions in the case of nationalised industries. What signal went out when the Government wrote off the debts of the industries that they were selling to the private sector?<br><br>
Local authorities cannot necessarily be expected to cope with problems that have been created largely as a result of the Government's policies not just on housing and rents but towards local authorities in general. The Government know that, just as the district auditor and the Audit Commission know it. The answer can be found in successive reports that have landed on the Minister's desk during the past few days. Everyone knows it. The Government have made a catastrophic mess. The Minister knows that, in many cases, rent arrears have arisen not as a result of people refusing to pay their rents but because of the way in which the Government introduced housing benefit some years ago, thereby causing mayhem in the administration of the system. No one wants to encourage mortgage payers—whose debts have also increased—or rent payers, not to pay their debts.<br><br>
I warn the Government again that, unless they reform housing finance to make it fairer to people on lower incomes and first-time buyers, they will prolong the crisis for people who are renting and people on lower incomes who are buying. That is what the Government have been doing for years, and no doubt they will continue to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In an attempt to lower the temperature of the debate, may I put the problem to the hon. Member for Hammersmith as directly as I can? What signal would go out to tenants in Barking and Dagenham about the nature of their council, which has insisted that they pay their rents, if the unpaid rents in the London boroughs of Brent and Southwark were written off? What would it say about those councils that had failed to do their job properly? If we did what the hon. Gentleman wanted us to do, would we not be slapping in the face those efficient and compassionate Labour councils that have made sure that rents were paid so as not to penalise decent tenants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The kindest thing that I can say about the Minister for Local Government is that he does not understand the problem. If he does understand it, I can only say that he is adopting a cruel attitude towards tenants. The problem is not just to do with bad management and it is not just to do with Labour local authorities. Conservative authorities too have been told by the district auditor to write off arrears.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will put his brain into gear for a short time and ask himself why that happened. It is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0879">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 833</span>
because the district auditor thinks that we should encourage people not to pay their rents. The district auditor does not think like that; nor do Labour or, indeed, most Conservative councillors. They all recognise that what has happened during the past few years in terms of rents, the organisation of housing benefit and its imposition by the Government has been catastrophic. Because of that, the district auditor and Conservative and Labour councils have been placed in the trap out of responsibility for which the Minister is now trying to wriggle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very obvious to Conservative Members that, when the hon. Member for Hammersmith is on weak ground, he resorts to being personal about individuals instead of trying to win the argument. I shall make a similar point to that made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government a moment ago.<br><br>
We acknowlege that the vast majority of Opposition Members in Committee represent areas in which the local authorities are fairly efficient about collecting rent. The hon. Gentleman still does not seem to understand that the worst offenders as regards efficiency in rent collection are in London, and all we are expecting and asking him to say is that there is a correlation between the efficiency of a local authority that has a massive housing stock to manage and the fact that that authority is a poor collector. If he will not listen to me on that, perhaps he will listen to Councillor Coombes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will read what I said in <i>Hansard.</i> I said that the housing benefit cuts were the main reason for the increase in arrears. I also said—he can read <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow if he doubts me—that in some cases bad management was involved. In any case, arrears cannot be written off if the authority is rate capped.<br><br>
I am occasionally personal about this matter—I make no bones about it—because whenever I see someone with a cardboard sign saying, "Homeless and hungry.", I know that the Government have become personal about it. They did it, and they did it with a vengeance. It did not happen under the Government formed by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath). It did not happen under Harold Macmillan or even under Winston Churchill. It certainly did not happen under a Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true. It is no good the hon. Gentleman saying "Nonsense". When I was a probation officer, I could always get someone somewhere to live, even in London, but I cannot do so now, and nor can the hon. Member for Taunton, in an area that has never before had a housing problem. Why is it that in Peterborough, Crawley and places where there has never been a housing problem before and where Labour local authorities have sold council houses and enabled people to move into housing quickly, hostels have had to be opened in the past few years? It did not happen under other Tory Governments, did it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) will tell us why it did not happen under the Government led by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 834</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman sees people with cardboard placards saying, "Homeless and hungry.", does he go up to them, ask for their name and address—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not have an address, do they?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, presumably they are able to vote. Does he ask for their details, their name and some evidence of the claim that they make and then forward those details to the local social security office? Perhaps when he sees someone with a placard round his neck trying to get money from the public the hon. Gentleman just accepts his story without further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make the hon. Gentleman an offer. On many occasions I stop and ask, because as an ex-probation officer I know what questions to ask. I also used to know which hostels to send them to but that was when hostels existed and when one could get people into them.<br><br>
The number of times I stop and talk to those people is constrained by the amount of time I have and—I make no bones about it—I do not always give money. When I am at King's Cross or Euston station, I am reluctant to give money because I am never quite sure on initial contact whether the person has a drug or alcohol problem. I often buy people food. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Pembroke does that.<br><br>
I want to make the hon. Gentleman this offer: I want him to come with me one evening. Then he will hear the questions that I ask people and the way in which I talk to them. He will learn how impossible it is to get money under the present housing benefit and social security regulations and of the lack of hostels and homes. Will he come with me? Yes or no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I shall come with the hon. Gentleman and ask them questions as well. I shall ask about the circumstances that brought them here, where they have come from and what home they have left to come to London. We will find out the details and refer them to the social security system. Constituents come to my surgery almost every week with such stories and, often, when I write to the Department of Social Security, I discover that what they have told me about their incomes is untrue. Hon. Members should investigate the facts before coming to the Committee with unsubstantiated stories and making sanctimonious speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not unsubstantiated stories. If the hon. Gentleman comes with me, he will not be able to give people lectures. He will have to treat them with respect, which he will find difficult. He may say that people who go to his surgery have problems too. I am talking about people who do not go to surgeries except to stop over after another homeless night.<br><br>
Home Office research shows the link between homelessness, alcohol and drug abuse and street crime. Homelessness is one of the reasons why street crime has risen under this Government, as I predicted it would two or three years ago. The number of juveniles is falling, so as expected, there is a decline in property crime, but violent crime of the type associated with drug and alcohol abuse and, of course, homelessness continues to increase.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pembroke talked about cause and effect. He must understand that the Government are responsible for breaking up more families than we can count. Young people come to London because they have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0880">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 835</span>
been asked to get some money. They have left home to look for work or have felt the guilt and pressure of their families' stresses and strains. They feel that their contribution is best made by going to get work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members may think that we do not ask questions. When going home late this week I met someone with a similar accent to mine. We had a cup of tea in a cafe and I asked him why he was out so late. He said that he had come down to London, had got a job, but needed to work for four weeks before he could raise the money for the deposit on a rented place to live. Until then, he had to sleep out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Conservative Members do not understand that people are sometimes asked to pay several hundreds of pounds as a deposit. Hon. Gentlemen should try to imagine what it is like for someone who has to tell his local social security office that a landlord has said that he can have a room for £40, £50 or £60 a week if he can find £200, £300 or £400 as a deposit. When the hon. Member for Pembroke comes with me he will be able to say to people like that "Don't worry son" or "Don't worry young lady. I will get it for you," because according to him, there is no problem. Those people have suddenly turned up on the streets. They were not there under previous Tory or Labour Governments. Conservative Members' attitude to homelessness is rather like their attitude to unemployment. There is no such thing as unemployment, we are told—it is just a wicked rumour put around by 2·5 million people with nothing better to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No individual or political party has a monopoly of compassion for the homeless. If the hon. Gentleman really talks to the homeless he should ask them what they think about the 23,000 empty council properties in London alone. What does the hon. Gentleman think about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have told the Minister many times that housing management in local authorities is basically good. In some areas, however, it is bad, under Labour and Tory—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah. Now we are getting an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been saying that for a long time, but the Minister has not heard me. Local authorities' housing management is not as bad as the Government's. Dozens of families could be accommodated in those flats and houses that are to be turned into car parks and landscaped areas around Wormwood Scrubs. There are dozens—[HON. MEMBERS: "The Minister was talking about thousands".] Does not the Minister understand? There are thousands of them in the public sector but in the private sector there are hundreds of thousands. The percentage of empty housing stock is far greater than in the local authority sector, which has the lowest percentage of empty housing stock of any of the other rented sectors—that is, housing associations, the private sector and the Government. Local authorities have 2·5 per cent. empty; the figure for housing associations is also pretty good, at about 3·1 per cent. That for the private sector is between 4 per cent. and 4இ5 per cent. The figure for the Government is the worst of all, at nearly 6 per cent.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago we were discussing local authorities' responsibility for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 836</span>
pursuing, in a civilised way, cases of arrears. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) brought my local authority into the discussion before he extended the argument.<br><br>
A few weeks ago I noticed that arrears in Taunton Deane were increasing and I asked for a report on the matter. I do not want to judge how far that is related to last year's housing benefit changes. I am not the greatest fan in the House of some of those changes. I received a report analysing 48 cases which, on 4 April, the council was seeking authority to take forward to court. That is what local authorities should do about arrears cases; I hope that most Conservative authorities are doing that and that more Labour local authorities in London will do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to Taunton in the context of homelessness. I know nothing about its rent arrears levels. I do not say and have never said that action should not be taken on rent arrears.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Member for Taunton has criticised housing benefit and its operation but he should understand that many people who are in arrears are not bad people; they want to pay their debts. If someone is asked to pay up to 40 per cent. of his net income in rent—that is becoming commonplace—he will get into trouble. Suppose that the hon. Gentleman buys a house and is asked to pay 40 per cent. of his net income in mortgage payments. I suggest that he would be unable to do so for more than a relatively short time without getting into acute difficulties. But that is what is happening to tenants in the public and private sectors.<br><br>
However, the Government are on the defensive—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall give them no leeway on the issue of compassion because that is what they lack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been doing some quick calculations. When I first came to London, I paid about £25 a month in rent out of an after tax salary of £68 a month. That is pretty close to 40 per cent. I do not say that my pay was below average, but that is the rent that I paid. I am speaking of 20 years ago. No doubt many people who come to London have to pay a similar proportion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman missed the point that, for a time, most of us who buy houses start off by paying close to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This was rent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I know. For a time someone can spend much of his net income on housing costs—let us call it housing costs—but he cannot do so for long without getting into acute trouble, unless he is at the higher income level. Someone who earns less than £15,000 a year and consistently spends more than 40 per cent. of his net income on housing costs will almost inevitably get into serious trouble. That is a fact.<br><br>
Having dealt with rent arrears, I wish to point out that the number of council houses built fell from 103,000 in 1975 to 15,000 in 1987. Under a previous housing Minister, the Government suddenly discovered that there would be a crisis unless they did something about public housing. They say that housing associations must be the answer. In 1975, housing associations provided 14,000 new units, but the figure in 1987 was 9,000.<br><br>
The local authority subsidy from Government has decreased from £1,258 million in 1978–79 to £496 million in 1986–87. The Housing Investment Programme allocations to English authorities was £5,266 million in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0881">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 837</span>
1978–79 and has decreased to £1,127 million in 1988–89. Therefore, we are spending far less on our gross national product on housing than any other western European country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to give the impression that the trend of cuts in council house building started in 1979 when the Government came to power. In fact, that trend started three years before the Government came to power. It is a matter of record and fact that the last Labour Government in each of the three years before they lost power in 1979 cut public housing expenditure by a significant amount. What has the hon. Gentleman to say about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the worst year the unit figure was 70,000 and was too low. It was right for the money that we spent then to be directed more towards repair and renovation so long as we did not go much below the 90,000 units per annum figure. The Government have not cut the figure to 70,000—the Labour Government's worst year—but to 15,000. In a couple of years time, such building expenditure will be non-existent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about housing associations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asks about housing associations. They are continuing to be cut because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures that the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) gives for HIPs during the last Labour Government largely reflect the great municipalisation programmes which took place in 1975–76. Authorities, such as Lewisham, on which I served, bought in one year just under 2,000 properties. That did not create more properties for the market; it simply took properties from one part of the housing sector to another. Further, the council had ready money to purchase and that pushed up the prices of properties available for owner-occupation in the borough. The actual new building in the borough was low.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem—<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is not true because the country must be taken as a whole. For example, it is not possible to build much more in areas, such as mine, therefore the number of new builds is limited. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is talking about the London area. In those years the difference was that the Greater London council provided properties elsewhere in London to take the strain of boroughs which were constrained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) mentioned the Government's well known support for housing associations. My hon. Friend is aware that I tabled a question for reply on 11 April, in the not too distant past, which has been answered by the Minister, and will appear in <i>Hansard</i> in due course. I asked
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State for the Environment, what his estimate was of the number of housing association units of accommodation which will be financed by mixed housing association grant and private finance for the 12 months period commencing 1st April; and if he would break down his estimates by Housing Corporation regions."</p></blockquote>
I received an interesting answer, given that the Government have boasted consistently that this would increase the number of units of accommodation. The reply was that the information was not available but the Minister would pass it on to me when he received the regional allocation process from associations through the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 838</span>
Housing Corporation. If the Government's boast is likely to be fulfilled in that year, does my hon. Friend think that they would have given me that reply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) is right. It is no wonder that the Minister is too embarrassed to listen. However, there are also other figures that reveal the whole ball game. The Housing Corporation approved development programme in 1978–79 was £686 million, but this year it is £655 million. That means it is less for the gross total ignoring investment. That is how pathetic the Government's record is on housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the Government are pathetic. I have not yet got to the kernel of the problem that faced the last Labour Government who did not exercise the right to buy, except in rare cases. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends choose not to take into account the vast amount of money that has been drawn down in the form of capital receipts from the right to buy. They always leave out those figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They cannot be used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh! They cannot be used. I thought that we debated in some detail a few weeks ago how they could be used.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have pointed out in debate on the Floor of the House and elsewhere that the previous Labour Government changed direction because of the International Monetary Fund. But it was not. I have no doubt that that made it more difficult for them. That is a statement of fact, not conjecture. The hon. Gentleman's noble Friend Lord Barnett explained in his book "Inside the Treasury" why he cut housing expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is he now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the hon. Gentleman's terms, he was a superb Treasury Minister. I suppose we could say that he was for us but he was on the wrong side of the House of Commons. In his book he writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"I felt some of them were eminently 'cuttable', especially in expenditure on roads and housing."</p></blockquote>
He took that decision prior to 1978 which my recollection tells me was when the IMF became involved. The Labour Government's policy of cutting housing expenditure had already begun.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will not accept the reasons why the policy had to be changed, but even the Labour Government thought that there was an alternative to public housing. Will the hon. Member for Hammersmith explain how we have ended up with the highest percentage of public housing stock in the Western world? Is he proud of that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is quite long enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make progress, Mr. Hunt. I am conscious that I have been speaking for a long time. I tried to allow the Minister to make the Government's case. I will not respond to the irrelevant comments. As regards the large public sector stock, the way local authorities in other countries do things may be slightly different, but the impact is the same, which is good.<br><br>
The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) that his ideas about council house sales were wrong. How does he feel about the following quotation of Lord Caithness as recently as this month?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0882">Image</span>

<br><blockquote><p>"Council housing is currently restraining rather than increasing public expenditure because capital receipts from sales bring in more than councils are allowed to spend."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the capital receipts which—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I thought that the hon. Gentleman referred to the capital receipts which are going in abundance to local authorities in the south and unfairly disadvantaging those in the midlands and the north. That is why we are changing policy in the Bill.<br><br>
It is well known that capital receipts can at present be spent to the extent of 100 per cent. on repairs and 20 per cent. on new build.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not on new build.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Not on new build."—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is becoming like housing questions. We must get on with discussing the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to.<br><br>
The key problem has been a dramatic collapse in the supply of affordable housing. The Government are trying to bully tenants out of local authority housing by forcing up rents. Housing association and private rents are to increase. Perhaps the Minister will now tell us what the Government's policy is. Is it market rents? Is it affordable rents? Is it fair rents? Or reasonable rents? Will the Minister answer? If it is affordable or fair, what are the criteria? Is it half net income, or one twentieth? How do the Government define "affordable" or "fair"? What is their moral justification for combining income support with housing subsidy and making the poor subsidise the poor?<br><br>
The average rent in local authorities in England and Wales in April 1988 was £18·74 per week. It was £23·51 in London. Abandoning historic cost systems, as the Government propose, will drive up rents. What higher figure do the Government have in mind? I presume that the Minister will reply that they are being kept artificially low for political reasons in some areas, in which case I should tell him that only two councils' rents were above £30 per week, nine were between £25 and £30, 77 were between £20 and £25 and 221 between £15 and £20. Only 13 were below £15 per week. Those 13 "political" authorities included Exeter, Bridgnorth, Hereford, Bromsgrove, Stevenage, Glanford, St. Edmundsbury, Oadby and Wigston and York. How many of those are "irresponsible Left-wing" boroughs? Not very many—if any exist.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Historic cost is used to calculate the owner-occupier subsidy. Mortgage is related to the price paid. Is the Minister against that? It is a similar situation. Should mortgage payers pay what their property is worth now, rather than what it was worth when they bought it? That is the equivalent, in the owner-occupier sector, of imposing the rules about historic cost that the Government have in mind. As in the case of the subsidy on spare rooms, the Government do not seem to believe that the taxpayer should pay for the subsidy unless it is for an owner-occupier, or perhaps they intend to take that away from people who get tax relief on their mortgages.<br><br>
Sixty per cent. of council tenants and many housing association tenants are on rent rebates. How much more does the Minister think they can bear? The Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 840</span>
are getting rid of the housing revenue account, to which amendment No. 420 refers. Do they intend to get rid of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977? I fear that they will. In the case of local authorities that have got rid of all their housing or are planning to do so, the Government will have to decide sooner or later how to apply the 1977 Act.<br><br>
Many people believe that the Government will soon change the definition of homelessness. Local authorities that have no housing will face the problem of finding housing for the homeless. The Minister's office issued a directive to local authorities that had no housing and suggested that they may wish to enter contracts with private landlords, but private landlords may not wish to enter such contracts or may limit them to 12 months. As it would be a different form of tenancy, landlords would have to get rid of the tenants.<br><br>
Perhaps the Government are simply embarrassed by the figures and want to change the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 because, as in the case of unemployment, that is the best way of bringing the figures down. In what circumstances will the Secretary of State grant consent to abolish the housing revenue account?<br><br>
I have spoken for longer than I intended, largely because I had to give way to Ministers. I want to know the Government's definition of affordable or fair rents. Are they after affordable or fair rents, or market rents? If rents are to be affordable, what are the criteria, what is the level, and what can people in the private and public sectors expect? That is what the amendments are about and that is why they are important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the questions asked by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) about the definitions of affordable and market rents. He made it clear that his definition of a market rent is a rent that the market will bear. He may be surprised to hear that I agree. I cannot think of any other possible definition.<br><br>
Affordable rents are those that are affordable by the people expected to pay them. The fair rent to which the hon. Gentleman referred is clearly defined in former legislation. The situation changed as a result of the new housing regime, as encapsulated in the 1988 Act. I found those questions easy to answer—I see no difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the debate on the Housing Act 1988, another term has emerged in the Government's advertisement to recommend to council tenants the new scheme for housing action trusts. The advertisement contained the phrase, "a reasonable rent". Will the Minister tell us what that means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is probably the easiest question of all. If, in terms of tenants' choices under part IV of the 1988 Act, a housing association tried to persuade local authority tenants to consider it as an alternative landlord, it would have to propose a rent regime which those tenants believed was reasonable. If such a regime was not interpreted as reasonable by those tenants they would not leave the local authority. That is fairly obvious, and common sense would drive one to that conclusion.<br><br>
This part of the Bill is crucially important and is not, as the Opposition would have us believe, an attack on local authorities or on their overall housing management reponsibility. I have already said that it would be complete nonsense for either the hon. Member for Hammersmith or me to suggest that all local authorities should be tarred with the same brush. My right hon. Friend the Minister for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 841</span>
Local Government, has said that he will be just as critical of Conservative-controlled authorities which are inefficient in management terms. I echo his words and say that we would be consistent. It would be nonsense for me to suggest that every Conservative-controlled authority is superbly efficient in housing management terms. But I should try to convince the Committee that the vast majority are far more efficient than Labour-controlled authorities.<br><br>
There is a massive difference of opinion between the Opposition and the Government as to how we should redress the housing problems that we face—not just homelessness, although we consider that to be a real problem which we are addressing through our review, but how to stimulate the private sector to become more involved in housing for rent and how to encourage local authorities to become more efficient.<br><br>
We get the impression from the Opposition, and it is consistent with their views expressed on the Floor of the House, that an increase in efficiency means a much harsher regime being brought to bear. That is not true. Efficiency is the ally, not the enemy, of compassion and that is certainly so in housing. If the efficiency of local authority management of its housing stock is increased—I have seen good examples of that in many boroughs especially in Knowsley—the tenants are the first to appreciate it. If they complain that their repairs are not being dealt with speedily—many of us have to take up problems of that kind—an overall improvement in efficiency is in their interests. This part of the Bill will bring about that increased efficiency.<br><br>
This Government have done more than any other—including previous Conservative Governments—to widen the housing choice and opportunity available to ordinary people. We have made possible the highest-ever level of owner-occupation. Almost two-thirds of householders now own their own homes, and we have taken steps to encourage wider choice for those in the rented sector by encouraging potential private landlords back into the market and by supporting the growth of housing associations. We shall continue to do that. In particular, we have given council tenants the chance to buy their own homes and the opportunity to choose a different landlord.<br><br>
However, despite these greater opportunities, we recognise that council housing will be a significant part of the total housing stock for the foreseeable future. That is why it is essential that those tenants who stay with the councils can rely on a financial structure that encourages responsibility, accountability and efficiency from their landlords and which reflects the changing situation of council housing and of the housing market generally.<br><br>
I acknowledge the completely laudable performance of many housing authorities throughout the country that provide a speedy, responsive and accountable service and make a fair and proper charge for that service. There is nothing in the Bill that will undermine the position of those authorities but it must be said that the present system is weak on incentives to efficiency, accountability and fairness. That is partly the fault of the legislative provisions under which councils have run housing services. Existing rules have made it all too easy for those that wished to do so to disguise inefficiency, distort accountability and completely disregard the concept of fairness. The new provisions are necessary to ensure that proper incentives and disciplines are built into the system.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 842</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the rules under which councils operate. One of them relates to their statutory duty to house the homeless. Some councils, such as Chiltern district council have got rid of all their council houses, so they encounter difficulty when trying to house the homeless people who come to them. I know that the Government are reviewing the problem of homelessness, so I ask the Minister to tell us how far they have got with it as many councils have been waiting for the result for a long time. When will it be published and what will it say?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked two questions. The first relates to local authorities which have taken advantage of large-scale voluntary transfers of housing to the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. As a former member of Chiltern district council who has kept in touch with what is happening in that area, I can advise him that the council has kept ownership of its hostel for homeless families and that it has been enlarged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention. I had intended to continue by saying that even if all of a local authority's public housing stock were to be transferred to a housing association, private landlord or some other part of the private sector, under the Act, as correctly described by the hon. Member for Hammersmith, responsibility for homeless people would remain with that local authority.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) asked about our current review. We have only recently received the report of the Audit Commission and had not expected that Professor Maclennan's report, which made a comparison between managements in housing associations and local authorities, would necessarily contribute to that study, but we believe that it has done so in a helpful way, despite what was said by the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Therefore, we hope very soon to be able to announce the future policy of the Government and the Department.<br><br>
Clause 63 sets the scene. It largely replicates the existing duty on local housing authorities to keep a housing revenue account. I do not say that the hon. Member for Hammersmith got himself into something of a tizz on the matter, but we are keeping housing revenue account as a keystone of this part of the Bill. It sets out in some detail the classes of houses and other property which are to be held within the HRA. It also enables the Secretary of State, where necessary, to clarify that definition. Councils own a large amount of property and perform a wide range of functions, so it is important, if they are to be truly accountable to those who enjoy the benefits and those who pick up the cost, that the HRA is clearly and appropriately defined.<br><br>
What the clause is meant to do is quite clear, so I cannot see the necessity for amendment No. 425. The hon. Member for Hammersmith did not dwell on the various amendments that we are debating, but I do not have a clue why amendment No. 425 should have been tabled. It would add a few words but no meaning to the clause. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can elucidate further on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the worry is about the housing revenue account.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0884">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 843</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is not but, I am sure that there will be no argument about the matter. I am merely saying that amendment No. 425 is totally unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Minister to learn that I wanted to open up a debate on the affordability of rents. That was the purpose of amendment No. 425.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that a number of other clauses would have allowed the hon. Gentleman to introduce that debate, but no matter.<br><br>
Subsection (6) provides that should an authority dispose of all its housing stock it may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, close the housing revenue account. That is a somewhat different question from that asked by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Hammersmith understands what I am saying about closing the HRA if, for example, there were a wholesale transfer. Wholesale disposals of stock are becoming more than a theoretical possibility. The hon. Gentleman has referred to one example, and I think that there will be others, although that may be conjecture.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Clause 128, which we will discuss with part IX, recognises the fact that a growing number of authorities believe that the needs of the public can be better served by transferring council housing to another landlord. Subsection (6) merely reflects the situation as it is. Once an authority has disposed of its houses there would in most cases be no point in keeping a housing revenue account. Amendment No. 430 however, would require the council, come what may, to keep the account for evermore. Why is that? Perhaps a future Labour Government—unlikely though that may be—could reverse this legislation, and there, ready and waiting for the new regime to take over, would be the housing revenue account. I doubt if that is the purpose of the amendment. It seems nonsensical. If the Government were to accept the amendment, hon. Gentlemen would be quick to accuse us of placing unnecessary and onerous duties on councils. Opposition Members spend a disproportionate amount of time accusing the Government of making local authorities comply with over-onerous duties.<br><br>
The clause and those that follow will place local housing on a firm financial footing. They will ensure consistency and equity, encourage the spread of good practices and improve local accountability. The end result will be a better, more responsive and more flexible service to tenants. Neither of these amendments would help to reach that goal, so I ask the Committee to reject them.<br><br>
I am gald that we have had an early opportunity to discuss council rents. Understandably, the subject is of more interest to tenants, and possibly to councils, than any other aspect of the new regime. It is unfortunte that most of the public airing of this issue, so far, has been based on an exaggeration and distortion of our proposals. I do not expect the hon. Member for Hammersmith to stop exaggerating. I expect him to continue to do so, no matter what I say, but I hope that he will try to get the facts straight before he chooses to distort them as he usually does.<br><br>
The exaggeration and distortion has meant that tenants have been needlessly alarmed for cheap political gain. I make no apology for that comment. I hope that what I am setting out today will dampen the sensationalism which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 844</span>
hon. Member for Leeds, West, in particular, enjoys, and with which the Opposition have approached this important subject.<br><br>
We have a number of interrelated aims behind our policy for council rents. First, we want to make sure that councils have the necessary resources adequately to maintain their housing stock and to provide a good standard of service to council tenants. Those who have chosen to stay with the council have a right to expect houses that are fit to live in and repairs to be carried out quickly and effectively. The reverse of that is that tenants should also expect to have to pay a fair price for the service that they receive. We are also anxious that councils should play their role in the wider housing market. One important consideration is that a council's rent policies should not cause distortions in the market that affect people's freedom and choice.<br><br>
The problem is that councils are in a privileged position in the housing market. I have spent some time this morning outlining the massive size of the council sector. I accept that the size of the council housing sector makes it a dominant force. Councils have become price fixers in the market. If other landlords cannot provide housing at a comparable price, they have little chance of competing—that point was omitted by the hon. Member for Hammersmith—which is why the proportion of private renting has declined from 50 per cent. in 1946 to the present paltry level of 8 per cent. Not only is the percentage of public housing stock in the United Kingdom the highest in the Western world—unlike, the hon. Gentleman, I am ashamed of that, but the 8 per cent. private rented sector is the lowest. That is wrong. The provisions in the Bill and other Bills that have recently been introduced will correct that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that I recently tabled a question to ask the Government whether they expect the proportion of private rented accommodation to increase as a result of the Housing Act 1988. The Minister said that he would write to me with the answer. He has made a great play of the decline in that stock, so can he now tell me what expansion he expects during the next two or three years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman expects me to give a definitive figure—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Quite. I am responsible for many matters, but not for crystal ball gazing. I do not flatter myself that I can predict precisely how far the private rented housing market will increase, but I can safely say that as a result of the measures introduced in the 1988 Act, it will increase dramatically in contrast to what has happened under Labour Governments and previous Conservative Governments. I passionately believe that former Conservative Governments did nothing to arrest that dramatic increase in the public housing sector and provide a fairer balance between public and private housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that I strongly support the measures to revive the private rented sector. I hope that they will extend to all parts of the country, including those parts to which I referred in recent debates. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would assure those who are anxious—I do not believe that they were misled by Opposition progaganda—that if council rents rise beyond a specific level, however justifiable in other respects, the pressures and incentives for more

tenants to exercise the right to buy, which we applaud, will further diminish the amount of council stock available to meet housing authorities' stautory duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's contribution on Second Reading was along similar lines and we shall return to the matter when we consider later clauses. I must convince my hon. Friend that the provision of public housing stock is not the only way of dealing with homelessness. The Housing Corporation has a responsibility to provide homes for the homeless. Local authorities, especially in rural areas, are often prepared to make deals with housing associations that specialise in housing development in rural areas and often agree to nomination rights—sometimes 100 per cent., although the average is 50 per cent. I visited such a development last week. It is possible to relieve homelessness in rural areas in such ways.<br><br>
I do not wish to be distracted by that matter now because it is more appropriate to a later clause, but as a result of my rural visits last week, I am at least up to date with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend returns to his original argument on the private rented sector, will he consider that in most other European countries the advantage of a large private rented sector is that it provides much greater choice for people of modest means?<br><br>
In many types of non-essential provision, such as television, the concept of renting makes items of no great importance available to large numbers of people who otherwise could not have them. Historically the private rented sector has helped to do so for items of great importance such as housing. Is it not sad that many years of municipalisation, aided and abetted by, I fear, Governments of both parties, have driven out a proper provider of decent accommodation for large numbers of people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend puts the issue extremely well. The dependency culture is extended and people are denied choice. There is little opportunity for choice between the private and rented sectors because there is not much private rented housing available. We are seeking to put that right. The extension of municipalisation leads to greater dependency. Some families have for generations believed that there is no alternative. We have given them the opportunity to exercise their right to buy and, recently, to choose alternative landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised to hear the Minister passionately denouncing monopoly as a distortion and arguing for intervention to set the housing market right. Will he take his argument further and say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was wrong to use public money through the business expansion scheme to subsidise people setting themselves up as private-sector landlords? Was it not a wrong use of public money to subsidise the private sector in that way? Surely that was intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly was not. In the 1988 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer sought to stimulate the development of low-cost housing at affordable rents within the means of people on low salaries. The Labour party considers this issue to be the most important aspect of its party-policy machinery. I am staggered that, with the exception of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), who is not a Socialist, only four Opposition Members are participating in this important debate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 846</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Three.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are three most of the time. I had to put that on the record.<br><br>
The council monopoly is reinforced. Choice and mobility are restricted. If councils competed on equal conditions with other sectors, it would be difficult to find fault with the operation of the market. In reality, the odds are stacked heavily in favour of local authorities and against the private sector, partly as a result of historical accident.<br><br>
Much local authority stock is comparatively old. Councils have relatively low outstanding costs on the original capital employed. They have traditionally used part of the accounting surplus that they can make on their older stock to subsidise the rents of tenants in the new stock. A private landlord trying to enter the market could not possibly have that advantage. His capital costs would be much higher. It would not be in his interests to invest in housing unless he was receiving a favourable return on the current value of his property.<br><br>
To elaborate, in a recent debate on our housing policy on the Floor of the House I said that I believed that the unfair comparison plus the adverse effect of the Rent Acts had led to the considerable decline in the private rented sector market.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister reconcile his argument that a private investor in property has to increase rents to realise a return on capital, with the fact that in my constituency British Coal sold an estate of more than 200 houses at about £2,000 to £2,500 each, and then trebled the rents?<br><br>
With an investment of £2,000 to £2,500 in a house, is it necessary dramatically to increase the rent to get a return on that capital? Surely that is exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exploitation by whom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By the new landlord—the faceless people whom we never see.<br><br>
The Minister said that councils were at a disadvantage. Is he saying that council tenants are at a disadvantage? Why is it that the people living in those National Coal Board houses do not have a choice of landlord? The landlord was imposed on them. There is no advantage to council house tenants; they are at a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what I said about local authorities. I said that local authorities were in an advantageous position compared with the private sector. The freedom of choice to which the hon. Gentleman refers was introduced only in the 1988 legislation. He talks about British Coal selling properties. I assume that that happened some time ago, because I recall going round his constituency with him.<br><br>
Comparatively few people in the private sector—either developers or investors—considered it worthwhile investing money in the private rented sector. I do not know where they have been in the past few years—unless they were deterred by the Rent Acts or were more attracted by other forms of investment, where they could obtain a higher return and have considerably less difficulty, bearing in mind the necessity for constant management of the stock. We had to attract developers and investors back into the market. In my reply to the hon. Member for

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 847</span>
Leeds, West I said that we had to stimulate the private rented sector. I do not believe that the Labour party opposes that policy; it merely favours the extension of public housing or the extenstion of municipality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not believe that that will work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but I do not believe that the Labour party is against the extension of the private rented sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speak for yourself. Do not tell us what we do or do not believe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to pick off Labour Members one by one. Now we have found a Labour Member who is against the extension. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) had better understand that both major parties accept that housing associations are the private rented sector. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The hon. Member for Tottenham had better make his view clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The Minister should make his view clear. He should not tell us what ours is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only would I never dare, but I would be so ashamed that I would never get a word out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not speaking for the Labour party, but I suspect that my hon. Friends will agree with what I am about to say. As we made clear repeatedly during the Committee stage of the 1988 legislation, the Labour party is not against any form of reasonable rented property—whether in the hands of responsible private landlords, housing associations or local authorities. Where the Minister misunderstands us is that we are in favour of people who rent property, for whatever reason, having choice between and within tenures. We believe that the terms on which they enter and leave tenureship should be more equal than they are at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely helpful intervention, and I expect the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) to take a more balanced view than his hon. Friends. Obviously, I was not a member of that Committee—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Let us analyse what the hon. Gentleman has just said and, for a bit of interest, try to understand what the Labour party action policy is on housing, because I confess that I am not clear about it. It think that we have come closer to it with the help of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North than we have for some time. To do a Brian Walden, if I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he has just said that the Labour party is not against the housing association movement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We never said we were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that the hon. Member for Leeds, West was party to this. I am just trying to clear up the matter on a bilateral basis with the hon. Member for Knowsley, North who I think knows a little more about it than the hon. Member for Leeds, West.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Knowsley also said that the Labour party was not against the private rented sector. I assume that he would endorse what his hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith has said on the Floor of the House, namely, that the vast majority of landlords are decent and good landlords.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in favour of responsible landlords.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 848</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. He then said that the Labour party was in favour of wider choice for those people who have the choices to make, in other words the tenants. I find it difficult to see the difference between that policy and ours. <i>[Laughter.]</i> I must warn my hon. Friends that we are in danger of having our clothes stolen on this issue. The Housing Act 1988, particular part IV, gave a clear undertaking that tenants could choose to stay with the local authority or move to an alternative landlord. What is wrong with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has correctly repeated two thirds of what I said. I also said that we wanted the terms on which people enter into any form of tenureship to be fairer than they are now. At present—the Government have done nothing about this—more subsidy goes into owner-occupation through the mortgage income tax relief system, than goes into any form of rented accommodation. We are anxious that the terms should be fairer than they are now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I could have a long debate on the question of tenure. He is now talking about secure and assured tenancies. If that is his main point, of course there is a difference of opinion between us, but for tenants who choose to stay with the local authority, the tenure and tenancy arrangements will not change. We shall doubtless return to the subject, and I should be delighted to explore still further Labour party housing policy.<br><br>
I have made it clear that councils carry all their property in their books at historic value. The hon. Member for Hammersmith, through amendment No. 426, is seeking to perpetuate that, but the amendment would allow authorities to continue charging the same rents based on historic cost without regard to the real world. Historic cost rents do not reflect what the property and services provided are worth to the tenant. They give councils an unfair advantage in the rented market, and no incentive to improve services and perform efficiently.<br><br>
The second advantage enjoyed by councils was given by this Government, and many of them have fought against it. The success of the right-to-buy policy has given many councils large surplus capital receipts. They have been able to use those receipts based on current values to pay off old debt, reducing historic debt costs even further, or they have invested the capital and gained a revenue benefit from the interest.<br><br>
The third advantage is tackled head-on in this part of the Bill. At present, authorities are completely free to use ratepayers' money to hold down rents. We shall discuss the proposed ringfence in more detail later, but I should make the obvious point now that neither private landlords nor housing associations have the same access to subsidy from the public purse when they want it. They have it in certain instances, as the hon. Member for Knowsley, North would accept. But it is not ready or immediate access, whereas in the public housing sector it is on tap.<br><br>
Some councils claim that they have a right to exploit those advantages because of their special role in providing housing for the under-privileged, but that is a distortion of the real picture. Local authority and housing association tenants are, by and large, the same sort of people in the same sort of financial circumstances. Tenants who have difficulty in meeting their housing costs receive specific, targeted help through housing benefit. The effort of effectively holding down rents across the board means that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0887">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 849</span>
subsidies are given indiscriminately, whether they are needed or not, to anyone lucky enough to rent from the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that not the same as mortgage interest tax relief, which is not targeted either?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to extract from the hon. Gentleman precisely what the Labour—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it or is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mortgage interest tax relief is of considerable benefit to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it targeted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not targeted in that it is available to those who would in any case qualify. However, in terms of efficiency—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall go away and think about it, but I do not believe that mortgage interest tax relief could be targeted more specifically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be easy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that it would be easy—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about housing provided specifically by the community for those who could not otherwise afford proper accommodation. Therefore, it is, of its nature, targeted housing. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If it were possible to provide housing without any help from the state, the state would not have to do it. With mortgage interest tax relief, we kindly allow people to keep more of their money to spend on their accommodation. <i>[Laughter.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and after that to spend as they choose. I do not know why there is such hilarity about what my right hon. Friend said. He is absolutely right. Housing is specifically targeted and subsidised whether in the public rented sector or, in the vast majority of cases, the private rented sector through housing association grants. If that is not a form of subsidy, I do not know what is. It is nonsense for hon. Gentlemen, who clearly do not understand housing policy if they do not understand the difference, to laugh. Obviously, housing is specifically targeted and we admit that we shall have to continue it. That might be news to the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I recall that he asked me whether I accepted that the public housing rented sector would be needed in future. We accept that such a provision is needed for the foreseeable future. That is as far as any Minister would be prepared to go.<br><br>
It has been recognised for some time that the circumstances that I outlined earlier to the Committee are nonsensical. The point is made succinctly in a circular from my Department which urged councils,
<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure that Exchequer and rate subsidies are not distributed indiscriminately to tenants who do not need them."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"subsidies should not be used wholly or even mainly to keep general rent levels low. Help for those who most need it can be given only if the subsidies are in large part used to provide rebates for tenants whose means are small."</p></blockquote>
I shall read that again, slowly, because the hon. Member for Hammersmith may find something that he can quarrel with. The quote starts:
<br><blockquote><p>"subsidies should not be used wholly or even mainly to keep general rent levels low."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 850</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Member for Tottenham will disagree with the quote. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Help for those who most need it can be given only if the subsidies are in large part used to provide rebates for tenants whose means are small."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hammersmith agrees with that.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It is not sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is not sensible. That quote is not from our White Paper; it is from the White Paper produced by Richard Crossman who, as the hon. Gentleman might just about recall, at one time was the Minister of Housing and Local Government. I suppose that the hon. Gentleman will now disagree with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. It is simple. I said that that was not sensible because we were talking about the present. At that time, there were controlled rents. The Minister does not understand the argument. If rents are set independently of a landlord, a different subsidy system is needed from that for market rents. The Government are introducing market rents, so that statement is irrelevant to the present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The complete converse of that is to make all those benefits available indiscriminately—whether the people can afford to pay the rents and whether builders can afford to develop houses without tax incentives or subsidy. It is nonsense. It may seem ridiculous, but I agree with Richard Crossman and what the Labour Government said at that time. The tragedy is that it has taken us two decades to implement what Richard Crossman advised the country to do. Circumstances have not changed as dramatically as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me help the Minister again. Circumstances have changed; there were controlled rents at that time. There is no difficulty in dealing with Richard Crossman in the context of his time. The Minister's problem is how to provide subsidy with market rents. He knows that if he subsidises market rents, the cost goes through the roof. He is prepared to allow indiscriminate, untargeted subsidy to owner-occupiers, but not to those in the rented sector, whether public or private. That is the trap into which the Minister has fallen—a trap into which previous Governments, Labour and Tory, did not fall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with a word of that. The hon. Gentleman has made a silly mistake, if I dare say so. He said that if we subsidised rents that were at market level, they would go through the roof. That is nonsense. Only this morning, the hon. Gentleman gave an accurate definition of a market rent—the rent which the market can bear.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot quarrel with our policy of making housing benefit available from whatever the current rent level up to—I choose my words carefully—the market rent level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Up to market rent level. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not understand that a limit is set in the areas. For example, in certain areas in and around London, a person loses all housing benefit over £80
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0888">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 851</span>
per week. The Minister does not understand the housing benefit rules; they are not his rules, but housing benefit and social security rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I challenge that. Clearly the hon. Gentleman and I will have to return to the matter. He and I had an exchange on the Floor of the House only two weeks ago about benefit changes. From my briefing session with the Department of Social Security before that debate, it became clear to me—I have said this several times—that housing benefit will be available up to market rent levels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is my position and I shall not move one jot from it unless I discover that the hon. Gentleman is right. He is so wrong on other matters that I do not want him to get away with deluding the Committee. I shall certainly raise the matter again, perhaps this afternoon.<br><br>
There is no excuse for authorities keeping their rents artificially low. The hon. Member for Hammersmith was wrong again when today he suggested that some Conservative-controlled authorities kept their rents low for purely political reasons and were perhaps getting things wrong. If efficiency in housing management is increased, it is possible to keeep rents low. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has fallen into the trap, into which he has fallen so many times this morning, of suggesting that we are attacking all local government and local authorities, when we are not—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the people we are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are talking about the people, I believe that the individuals who will gain by these provisions are the tenants of local authority housing. They will see a dramatic increase in the efficiency of the housing stock. Our broad aims were set out in our consultation paper. In particular, we emphasised that we were not looking for sudden, huge increases.<br><br>
I shall now answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Hammersmith. The hon. Gentleman was given an assurance by me, and by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on Second Reading, but he does not want to hear it. He wants to distort the truth and give the wrong impression that rents will go through the roof. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br>
We said clearly that the authorities most affected by the end of rate fund contributions to the housing revenue account would receive extra subsidy at the outset to prevent significant movements in rents. We said that the pressures for increases in rents would be gradual, although with relatively more pressure on councils which have deliberately held rents down. We are not seeking to control rents, but we will not provide subsidy to enable authorities to keep rents at unrealistically low levels.<br><br>
Clause 69 is concerned with the new HRA subsidy which we will pay to local authorities. The purpose of that subsidy will be to enable efficient authorities to provide a good standard of service at a reasonable and realistic rent. We will therefore need to take a view each year on appropriate rent levels in each authority. That is no different from the principle of the existing housing subsidy system which has operated for almost a decade.<br><br>
Under the new system, as under the old, we will decide every year what rate of increase in council rents generally will be acceptable. It is important to stress that the decision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 852</span>
would be taken annually on the general circumstances prevailing at that time. We have no preconception about the level to which rents should eventually rise. In deciding what the average annual change might be, we would certainly look at existing rent levels, the extent to which authorities were able to fund day-to-day repairs of their property and, of course, general movements in prices and earnings. We shall then consult with the local associations on the changes we propose each year. I am convinced that that will be welcomed by Opposition Members.<br><br>
This is manifestly not a hidden plot to move to market rents. I want to scotch that rumour right now. We have no target for council rents and I want to emphasise our commitment to a gradual, and only a gradual, movement in rents.<br><br>
Amendment No. 428 does not fit well with the system of objectives that I have outlined. It would prevent us from looking at an authority's rents before the introduction of the system in making our subsidy determination. That would not allow us to meet our objective of avoiding sudden movements in rent bills in individual authorities. Further, the amendment would not allow comparisons between authorities.<br><br>
Our policy is to encourage sensible, realistic rents. We want to avoid sudden shifts in individual rent bills and to protect the tenants of councils which have already pursued sensible policies. The aim must be increased fairness and better standards of service for those council tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. This has been a long and important debate. I simply want to say that we are now clear—this is the most important part of what the Minister said—that the Government will accept responsibility for council sector rent increases in future years. I am glad to know that. At least tenants will know who to blame for what is happening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said absolutely no such thing. The hon. Gentleman may care to reflect that under the Bill's provisions, as will become clear to him as we debate further clauses, local authorities will be placed more firmly and clearly on the spot as regards housing revenue account and how they administer housing stock, so the decisions will be theirs alone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the Minister will take a view on rents each year, but will not do anything about them. He will not take any action. We know that what he said first is what matters. He will take a view, and local authorities will be forced to respond to it, at least in part, because the only movement that he has allowed himself is consultation with local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. But we know that the Government will say to local authorities, "Your rent levels should be X. We want to know why you will not have them."<br><br>
The Minister also told us that he does not necessarily believe in market rents for councils, although he wants market rents generally. He said that market rents are supposed to apply in the public sector. The original consultation document stated that council rents would be below the market level. As I have often said, they will be at, or above, market levels.<br><br>
I will give an example of what is happening. Staffordshire Housing Association sought an increase in its rents from £91 to £99·5 per month in line with inflation. The rent officer, under the Government's policy for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0889">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 853</span>
housing associations, increased the rent to £130 per month although the association does not want it. That is the sort of policy we have. That is why we will press the amendments to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must return to the debate because it is clear that the hon. Member for Hammersmith has not understood it. He made a mistake which I believe could have been deliberate, in saying that I think that there should be market rents generally. I said no such thing. I have made it clear to the Committee this morning that we are not moving to market rents for public housing. I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that. More specifically, we are talking about the private rented sector and an allowance whereby higher rents can be charged than in the public sector, especially by housing associations, but more particularly by private landlords who have been sadly absent from the scene for the best part of 45 years.<br><br>
The reassurance that I am giving the Committee—I cannot claim to be the first to have said it because my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear on Second Reading—is that we are not moving towards market rents. We have always said that we are anxious to move, however gradually, to a position where the rents paid reflect more accurately the stock and current circumstances. That assurance, and the further assurance that we are anxious to continue the present discussions with local authority associations, should give the hon. Member for Hammersmith the comfort that he seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By that, the Minister again tells us only that the Government are still in a mess about whether they want affordable rents, market rents, fair rents or any other. It seems that under the new system the Minister will take a view on public rents, which may differ significantly between authorities, and, having had discussions with local authorities, will allow the private rented sector to do more or less as it wishes—which basically means market rents. Housing association rents will also be forced up, as he said. All that is bad news for the rented sector, public or private.<br><br>
The Government are prepared to give untargeted, unspecified relief to people who are buying—I do not object to a subsidy for buyers—but they are not prepared to give subsidy to those who rent. That is why the Government insist on keeping tenants of any type in the role of second-class citizens. Tenants are not second-class citizens—they are first-class citizens.<br><br>
In Switzerland, for example, where more than 40 per cent. of property is rented and a much smaller percentage is owned, there is a fairer distinction between the rental and purchase systems. That is the case in many other countries also. We should follow their example. We can do so and eventually we shall have to do so, because our treatment of tenants—public and private—is unfair.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like particularly to draw attention to amendment No. 538, which encapsulates our position on this and subsequent clauses relating to ring-fencing of housing revenue accounts.<br><br>
Ministers could not have thought up anything more vindictive and—I shall use the word that the Minister was fond of using earlier in the Committee's proceedings—despicable than the proposals contained in these clauses. People who are just above benefit levels, who are struggling to make ends meet, who are earning their living and doing their best to take responsibilty for themselves, their families and the community, are to be made responsible for the well-being of those who are less well off. There is nothing more venomous and vindictive than that.<br><br>
One cannot imagine a group of people who would sit down with their neighbours or other members of their community and tell them that they—and not the wider community—should be responsible for the provision of sheltered housing for elderly people, debt charges, management and warden schemes. Those are the responsibility of the whole community and, as we believe, of society. One cannot believe that the more expensive accommodation, with considerable aids and adaptations, that is necessary for people with disabilities is not the responsibility of the whole community, and that the costs that fall on the housing revenue account are not the responsibility of us all through national and local contributions.<br><br>
As with clause 70, it is difficult to imagine anything more disgraceful than the suggestion that one set of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0890">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 855</span>
tenants should be responsible for the benefit payments of other tenants. For years, the Government have lectured local authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. Member. I am listening carefully to him. He may be speaking to the wrong group of amendments. We are now dealing with amendment No. 429 which proposes to leave out the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with proper practices".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You said that other amendments were grouped with it, Mr. Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Member to refer specifically to the amendments to which he is speaking. In passing, I believe that he referred to amendment No. 538 which appears later on the amendment paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Hunt. You are right to correct me. When I entered the Room this morning, this was the version that I had and things have been changed round. This is the first time on which I have had to admit to it, and I hope that it will be the last, but I was not aware that the order had been changed. I apologise to you, Mr. Hunt, and to the Committee for that. We are now debating amendment No. 429 and the amendments grouped with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It so happens that I have an interest in this group of amendments and would be happy to speak briefly to amendment No. 387 if that would give the hon. Gentleman time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That suggestion makes sense and it would help me, so I would be happy if the hon. Gentleman were allowed to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that I call Sir George Young.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly to amendment No. 387 which has been put forward by the Association of District Councils. That body is worried because there may be a difference in the way in which housing revenue accounts are dealt with at present and it wants to ensure that existing practices adopted by local authorities can continue for the time being.<br><br>
When I was talking to members of the association last week, I was struck by the different way in which various items are treated in the accounts of local authorities. One could make a good argument for those differences of approach. The inclusion or exclusion in the housing revenue account of such items as provision for homelessness and wardens varies considerably between housing authorities. The purpose of the amendment is to allow authorities to continue that varied treatment in the first year of the system, despite the Secretary of State's wide powers to specify the coverage of the account.<br><br>
Listening to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's reply to an earlier debate, I understood that he wants parity of treatment between the local authority sector and the private sector. I entirely support that approach. On Second Reading he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Broadly speaking, only landlord expenditure will be charged to the housing revenue account. Expenditure on facilities shared with the wider community, or on such social services as wardens for sheltered housing, will either be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 856</span>
outside the ring fence or receive a contribution across it. As a result, both tenants and charge payers will get a clear picture of the services they receive and the charges they pay for them."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 February 1989; Vol. 147, c. 172.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with that. We need level playing fields and, in some cases, that is what the matter is all about as there is considerable variation in how grass cutting services are managed in different local authorities. There are disputes as to whether the communal space around tower blocks which are used by the wider community should be charged to the housing revenue account or community charge payers. The issue is not clear cut and time is needed to work out a fair and reasonable method and to determine to what extent standardisation of treatment is possible.<br><br>
The treatment of the cost of wardens is equally complex. Different local authorities have different job specifications and some wardens will often have to perform tasks that are not the responsibility of wardens in other local authorities. They may include tasks that come under a landlord's obligations such as rent collection. On what side of the ring fence should the role of a warden as handyman or good neighbour fall? Should local authorities be treated differently from housing associations?<br><br>
The Association of District Councils has some interest in how this matter is approached, and in the timescales involved. The simplistic treatment of open spaces on estates could lead to local inequities. For example, many people who bought their flats on council estates have, under their leases from local authorities, to continue to pay for the upkeep of the greens. The Secretary of State might well direct that the tenants—those who had not bought—should not be required to do so, and that the cost should fall on charge payers. Equally, he could, come to the opposite view and create an inequity between community charge payers and tenants.<br><br>
The Government are, I believe, committed to a gentle introduction of the new system in April 1990 which will coincide with the introduction of the community charge.<br><br>
The consultation paper of July 1988 stated in paragraph 16:
<br><blockquote><p>"the effect of these proposals will be to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. For the tenant the immediate effect should be indistinguishable with what would have happened if the current system had remained in force."</p></blockquote>
The amendment goes with the grain of that policy statement.<br><br>
When I spoke with the Association of District Councils last week, it was made quite plain that the gearing impact on the community charge could be high if various items that had always come under the housing revenue account had to come across to the other side of the ring fence. That could effect the local community charge dramatically.<br><br>
I have spoken for rather longer than I planned, but have perhaps given Opposition Members time to assemble their thoughts and their amendments. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will understand the ADC's worries and will go some way towards meeting them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise to the Committee, and in particular to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). As I hastened out of the room to sort out the amendment that I raised on a point of order, I assured him that he was on next. I am afraid that I was too quick off the mark, as I forgot this group. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) for stepping in and helping my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside who was, I gather, beginning to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0891">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 857</span>
grasp that a different group was under discussion. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend's contribution on the next group, which he is moving, will be excellent. I have a short engagment with the Home Secretary this afternoon, but shall do my best to be back to hear my hon. Friend.<br><br>
I can be quick with this group of amendments. To some extent, they are probing amendments, aimed at clarifying the Government's intentions and limiting the Secretary of State's powers. Amendment No. 429 seeks to find out what is meant by "a proper practice" in clause 63(1). What is it that local authorities are supposed to be doing that will be prevented by the new power of the Secretary of State?<br><br>
Amendment No. 443 denies the Secretary of State power to set out determinations and directions on the housing revenue account. What is the timetable? Will we know the timetable before the year 1990–91 or are the determinations and directions to come out at relatively short notice? If they do, any changes in those determinations and directions will make a great deal of difference as to how local authorities function.<br><br>
Amendment No. 444 would ensure that determinations are public documents. We think that, rather than being kept within the Department, they should be made available for wide discussion. The equivalent section of the Housing Act 1985 deals with the subsidies manual, which is an important document that sets out detailed rules on the housing revenue account. Are we to get a similar document under this legislation?<br><br>
Amendment No. 445 would limit the Secretary of State's wide powers to regulate individual local authority practices. What is the problem? Do the Government think that local authorities are mismanaging their housing revenue accounts? If they do, we should like to know how, who and why.<br><br>
The question about the circumstances in which the powers would be used follows on from my previous questions. The question about the amount of notice that a local authority will receive of the Secretary of State's intention concerns the problem of local authorities being able to plan in advance what they will do when the Secretary of State is taking increasing powers.<br><br>

Unless amendment No. 446 is accepted, the Secretary of State will be able to make directions in the middle of a financial year. I am not sure whether that is the Government's intention; I suspect that it is not, in which case, perhaps they will accept this amendment requiring any directions to be made during the year preceding the one in which they are applicable. If the amendment is not accepted, we want to know in what circumstances the Secretary of State may use the power to make a change in the middle of a financial year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 531 and 532 would have the effect of substituting "Audit Commission" for "Secretary of State". Will the Minister tell the Committee why it is better to give the Secretary of State wider power instead of giving the power to the body that is directly responsible for the matter?<br><br>
On amendment No. 539, the Minister was anxious previously to include relevant professional bodies and to omit local authorities, but in clause 63 he has included local authorities and omitted relevant professional bodies. That may be welcome, but I wonder why he chose to do that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On amendment No. 387, I agree with almost everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) said. However, I cannot accept it because only when the full information is received can we be absolutely sure that there is no remarkable distortion requiring a change in the first year. I should not want to be tied so much that I could not do so. Our general intention is to leave things very much the same because we are discussing with local authorities all the issues raised. Some of the issues do not sound important but are vital for proper arrangements locally—for example, footpaths, roads, lighting, play areas, gardens, open spaces, grounds, district heating systems, community alarms and so on. We must decide where they fit into the arrangements. I assure my hon. Friend that we intend to do what he wishes us to do. Only in cases in which we would all agree that conformity is necessary would we do otherwise, so I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
In that spirit of concession, I am happy to accept amendment No. 539, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). I cannot accept his other amendments, and Parliament would find it difficult to accept the concept of someone who is not accountable in the same direct way as the Secretary of State having powers that he has in large measure under the present system. The system will change, rather than the powers, which are modelled on those that the Secretary of State has had in the past.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) raised other issues. I shall resist the temptation to point out that since that excellent period of history, the Victorian age, the legislative practice has been that local authorities should operate according to what are usually referred to as proper practices.<br><br>
There are several difficulties with the hon. Gentleman's approach, although I am sure that he did not intend them. Proper practice changes according to current circumstances. It has always been accepted that it is reasonable to make clear what we mean by proper practice. From time to time it changes because accountancy is an ever-growing profession. I do not refer to its size, although I have some sympathy with the Monty Python concept of "help stamp out chartered accountancy". There is an evolving body of practice and knowledge, so it would be wrong to say that accountancy is a science that has reached its limits.<br><br>
There is no change from the previous approach. I have tried to follow the circumstances reflected by current statutes as closely as I can. There is nothing hidden behind our proposals.<br><br>
In reply to the specific questions of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, we intend to produce details in the summer so that there is no worry about last minute events. We shall not make arrangements to regulate in the middle of the year, but we need the power to do so. We have it under other legislation. We have used it rarely, only when an authority has asked us to do so to sort out a problem that was not apparent at the beginning of the year. Without the power there is a difficulty, although it is merely a practical one.<br><br>
It would be nonsense to use the power to distort or upset councils' annual arrangements, and I have no intention of doing so. The power has caused no problem in the past and it is necessary. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, the council has been most concerned about housing, irrespective of the party in power. Without the power, if something unforeseen

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 859</span>
happened, people would be disadvantaged for a whole year because we could do nothing about it. It is important that we keep the power.<br><br>
Apart from the arrangements here, many of the issues about which the hon. Member for Hammersmith is anxious are at present being discussed with local authorities. There is no intention of extending the Secretary of State's powers. We have tried to put into the legislation much of what exists now.<br><br>
I do not wish to hide from the hon. Member for Hammersmith the fact that we are making a new structure. In our previous discussions, we saw how my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is taking into account, for example, what are reasonable rent increases. The hon. Member for Hammersmith is right to say that, in a sense, the Department is looking into various practices that it has not covered before.<br><br>
We are not in general saying that there are malpractices in local government. The Bill will bring to an end some practices about which different parts of the House hold different opinions. Many of us are not happy about the practice of indiscriminately transferring support from the general rate fund to ratepayers who do not receive housing benefit. Equally, I believe that some Members on both sides of the House are not altogether happy about the practice operating the other way round.<br><br>
We must accept that there are disagreements about what certain councils do, but there is no need to read them into this part of the Bill. Our intention is to carry into the new system much the same powers as operated under the previous system. We intend to use them as we and previous Governments have always done to provide the maximum notice of any change and not to encourage mid-term changes. Our use of the power will depend on considerable consultations with local authorities to which we are committed, which we have started and which we shall continue. We shall heed what local authorities say and attach great importance to their opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's comments on amendment No. 539. It gives the Government an avenue to pursue in the future when amendments are tabled asking for consultation for local authorities. The Minister has tended to resist such proposals in the past, and it is interesting that he accepts the idea for professional bodies. Nevertheless, I welcome his reply, and I am pleased that he is prepared to accept the principle.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 520, in page 68, line 16, at beginning insert 'Paragraphs (a) to (d) of'.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 860</span>
The amendment is necessary to remove a potential conflict between subsections (1) and (3). Paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1) list houses and other property that are to be included in the housing revenue account. Paragraph (e) allows the Secretary of State to add by direction further categories of property to the list. Subsection (3) specifies those categories of property to which subsection (1) shall not, in general, apply—which would be excluded from the HRA. The amendment ensures that the Secretary of State may, under subsection (1)(e), specify for inclusion a property which generally will be excluded by subsection (3), and will ensure that the provisions of the clause are flexible enough to allow for changes in circumstances as they arise.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The very full debate that we had earlier almost constituted a clause stand part debate, and although the issues were aired at that time, there are some matters to which we must return. When local authorities lose their housing stock, the Minister suggested that the statutory right to house the homeless would still reside with the local authority, but he did not tell us how it could do that. He suggested that the responsibility would then pass to housing associations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that the power to deal with the homeless remains with the local authority, although it is possible for housing associations to have nomination rights. They have a responsibility, but not under law. That was my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. We agree on that. As he will recall, I pressed him on the report on homelessness that is still with his Department—I do not know whether it has gone further—but he gave us no publication date. There has been a series of reports on homelessness, as well as the Maclennan report. Birmingham university also produced a report, as did the Audit Commission. I hope that the Minister will press for that report to be brought before Parliament as soon as possible so that action can be taken to tackle the problem. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us a date on Third Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we shall be able to provide that information relatively soon.</span></p>
