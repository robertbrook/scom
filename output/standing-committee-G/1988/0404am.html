APPLICATION OF PART IV.</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 37, line 29, leave out '1990' and insert '1991'.<br><br>
We come back to what is perhaps the most exciting part of the Bill. It is an extremely important part, although it may be difficult for people outside the House and, indeed, in it to appreciate its significance. In a sense, it shows clearly what has gone wrong with the Government's previous legislation.<br><br>
The Government passed the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, through which they thought they would solve some problems, but they did not, and they have made a series of changes since then which have made it extremely difficult for local authorities to cope.<br><br>
In the autumn of 1984, the Government initiated a review of the local authority capital control system that was introduced in 1981–82. It showed the extent of the failure of the 1980 Act. Like so much recent legislation, that Act was produced hastily and drafted poorly. The Government have not learnt much. We are still getting such legislation, such as the Housing Act 1988 and, to some extent, this Bill. Such legislation seems massively to rely on the Secretary of State's discretion, a matter to which we shall return later this morning.<br><br>
It is absurd, and bad business management, to try to control capital expenditure annually and, equally, to attempt to control gross expenditure, net expenditure and borrowing without emphasis on any particular aggregate. The Minister must know a little about how private business works. Surely he knows that a business which tried to plan its annual expenditure year by year—knowing that the Government frequently move the goal posts—would automatically get into difficulties. A business cannot plan ahead in that way. That is the major problem for local authorities, Labour, Tory, Liberal or anything else—it is difficult for them to plan effectively. I sometimes think that making it as difficult as possible for them to plan is a deliberate part of the Government's policy to make local authorities seem inefficient and ineffective.<br><br>
The consultation paper, "The Review of Capital Expenditure Control System in England and Wales" was brought out in early 1986. Those proposals were withdrawn, following opposition from local government of all parties. In July 1988, another consultation paper, on capital expenditure and finance was produced. Its proposals form the basis of part IV of the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment would delay the introduction of this part of the Bill. The Government have waffled around for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 572</span>
years, producing consultation papers which have proved to be wrong and Acts of Parliament which have proved to be inadequate and unhelpful to local authorities. It is unacceptable for them suddenly to bring out a consultation paper in the middle of 1988, put the proposals into the Bill early in 1989—which could pass into law by the end of the year—and expect local authorities to adjust to them painlessly and without acute managerial difficulties. That asks far too much of local authorities and it is a totally unreasonable expectation. By giving local authorities at least an extra year, the amendment would enable them to work out some of the problems to which we shall refer in the debate on later clauses.<br><br>
Another thing which troubles me and local authorities of all parties is the extent of regulation powers that are left to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has powers to make regulations under clauses 30(1)<i>(k),</i> 30(3), 31(5), 34(5), 35(2), 39(1)<i>(c),</i> 39(5), 40(2), 40(3), 44(4), 48(6) and 49(3). I wonder why the Government bothered to put those clauses in the Bill—one simple clause which read, "Under this part of the Bill, the Secretary of State will decide whatever he wants to decide and tell the local authorities to do it," would have covered everything. The Bill has nothing to do with local government—it is about central control at the whim of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
If we look through that group of clauses—perhaps this is more clearly set out in clause 30—we will see that the powers given to the Secretary of State are wide ranging and given in such a way that they will make the job of local authorities budgeting, extremely difficult.<br><br>
If I were managing director of a company and trying to work out my financial policy for 1990–91 and the shareholders, or another group in a position of influence and control, said, "We are going to change things this year and will tell you how a few months before the change" The company would be in trouble. We all know that, and that the Government are creating problems for local authorities, including those controlled by their party.<br><br>
Local authorities have no idea of their likely level of resources in terms of basic credit approvals or annual capital guidelines for 1991. They will have great problems with planning. The analogy with the private sector is clear. The Government would not impose such restrictions on the private sector, so why are they imposing them on the public sector?<br><br>
If the argument is that restrictions will make authorities more efficient and businesslike, why are the Government not giving local authorities the same structure that the private sector needs? If, as I suspect, the Government's real aim is to make it more difficult to plan and to spend in the interests of local electors, we begin to see what the Bill is all about. The Government want more centralised control because they have an intense dislike of local democracy, regardless of whether it is controlled by the Tories, the Labour party or anyone else. Incidentally, that is why the London Boroughs Association and the Association of District Councils are worried about the indiscriminate nature of the Secretary of State's powers.<br><br>
Many bodies have called for an increase in local authority capital expenditure, not least because they know that the infrastructure of the British economy is being eroded and that that infrastructure is largely provided by local authorities. It is the classic picture of Conservative rule—private affluence matched by public squalor. That is the image of Conservatism throughout this century and previously.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 573</span>
In 1985, the Audit Commission said that there was a backlog of £15 billion worth of work to be done. The Government's stock condition inquiry said that the figure was £18·8 billion. How are the Government hoping to deal with that? If they want local authorities to do that work, and they are to introduce these regulations later this year, how on earth will a local authority plan to deal with that work in the timescale necessary? The money they need has been cut or denied them and they are also told that they will not know what the regulations are, or what the law will be, in six months' time? That is the time we are talking about. The Bill could be enacted in six months' time, which is why the amendment must be accepted.<br><br>
If the Government admit that £18·8 billion worth of work needs to be done, what will they do about it? Are they hoping that, somehow or other, the housing aspect will be lost because houses will be passed over to housing associations? What nonsense. We all know that housing associations are increasingly worried about taking on that burden. Even if they did take it on, they would not have the resources to deal with it. The problem will not go away simply because the Government duck their responsibility and try to pass it on to someone else.<br><br>
The Government could free the accumulated capital receipts, which in March 1988 amounted to about £6 billion and by next year are estimated to be about £8 billion. If the Minister said today that the Government will release some of that money to local authorities, at least they could begin to do some of the work which they cannot plan for on the basis of the Bill.<br><br>
The Government are reneging on a commitment given by Lord Jenkin on 19 December 1984, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The receipts are and will remain the property of local authorities. They can spend them in future years".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 December 1984; Vol. 70, c. 308.]</p></blockquote>
That pledge is being abandoned. Members on all sides of the House have often said that assurances given by the Government are not to be trusted. The reason is obvious—an assurance given by one Minister is rapidly ditched by his successor, sometimes only months later.<br><br>
As recently as January 1986, the Green Paper, "Paying for Local Government" stated
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities have been given the assurance that this amount"—</p></blockquote>
accumulated receipts—
<br><blockquote><p>"will be available in full over time to justify additional capital expenditure."</p></blockquote>
That assurance is also meaningless. If the Minister agrees to release the funds—although I should prefer him to accept our amendment No. 245—local authorities could begin some of the work that the Government's inquiries show needs to be done. Their assurances so far have meant nothing.<br><br>
The amendment would provide for implementation in 1991, not 1990. For the reasons that I gave, its acceptance would make the task of local authorities of all political complexions much easier. Without it, their task will be much more difficult. There is a strong suspicion inside and outside the House—across the party divide at times—that the Government are not interested in efficient administration of local government. They want only to prevent local authorities from doing what their electors elected them to do. We also strongly suspect that the Government are dangerously unaware of the serious run-down of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 574</span>
infrastructure of the economy and of the lack of preparation at local and regional level for 1992 and the integrated European market.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 245. If he does, even Conservative authorities will agree that they are being given an opportunity to respond to this difficult, complex and open-ended legislative proposal which allows the Secretary of State absolute discretion to decide how local authorities run their affairs. The power is being given to someone who is not a member of those bodies—something that the Government would be appalled at if it were done to the private sector. They are quite prepared to allow it to happen to local government, though. They should at least recognise that they no longer expect efficiency in local government. They are saying to authorities, "We shall put obstacles to efficiency in your path. If you cannot deliver, that is tough. We are passing the buck to you." I urge the Committee to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 245, and should like to underline a couple of points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley).<br><br>
When the Government insisted that local authorities sell council properties, they assured them that capital receipts would trickle through over a period, so that 100 per cent. would be spent even though there was a limit on the percentage that could be spent in the first year. There was at least a long-term prospect of being able to use capital receipts.<br><br>
Because of the enormous pressure that the Government have put on local authorities and because of the willingness with which some Labour and Conservative authorities have sold their properties, they have been far more successful than the Government anticipated. The Government now realise that the amount of capital receipts is such that they affect what the Government calculate to be the public sector borrowing requirement, which we are told no longer exists.<br><br>
I have never understood how money that comes directly from the sale of assets becomes involved in a calculation of the public sector borrowing requirement. Perhaps the Minister should seek technical advice because I doubt whether he understands either. I have detected confusion on both sides of the House. If one sells something, one receives money for it. Surely, to spend that money on something else does not increase net indebtedness.<br><br>
In my borough, we are in a terrible state. We are trying to spend our capital receipts before the deadline. We have a great deal to spend them on. I am delighted to hear that the Minister is coming to the London borough of Newham soon. In fact, I understand that both Ministers might venture there. We shall welcome them. It can only be in the interests of our council and of the people who live in the area for us to explain to Ministers the reality of life in a deprived borough such as Newham.<br><br>
We want to spend our capital receipts on improving some of our derelict properties. I do not understand why we should be prevented from spending the money that we get for land and property which we are selling at the behest of the Government, on the grounds that we are so successful that we are affecting the public sector borrowing requirement.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 575</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the unfairness of his authority not being allowed to spend all its capital receipts. He must remember that the money to build the properties was originally raised in large part from central Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. The local authority borrowed the money and has been paying it back with interest out of the rates. It could be argued that the local authority borrowed at a preferential rate, but that is another matter.<br><br>
The remark of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is nonsense. He always rushes in to defend the indefensible on behalf of the Government. I hope that at some stage his obsequiousness and sycophancy are rewarded by a humble job in the Whips' Office. If my colleague, the Conservative Whip, wants a true groveller, he should take the hon. Member for Pembroke. No one excels more in the art of grovelling. He has turned it into an art form. He should get a grant from the Arts Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what grovelling he did to become a Labour Whip?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be diverted. I am the only privatised Whip in the House of Commons. I am brought in for the difficult bits and I am referred to by my colleagues as "instant whip".<br><br>
In our borough, we have a great need to spend our money. Under the existing system, we at least know that all the money can be used over a period of time. Under the new system, we shall have to use it for debt reduction. Ministers should sit in my advice surgery and listen to me telling people, which I try to do objectively, "I'm very sorry that we can't make improvements to your house, and that we can't fit security doors or smoke alarms. We won't be able to fit them under the new system because I'm afraid that we shall be required by the Government to apply our receipts to debt reduction." That argument does not go down too well with the punters or with hon. Members on both sides of the House.<br><br>
The proposal is iniquitous. The amendment seeks only a further year's grace to use our receipts on good works. Perhaps the Minister will tell us that he will allow that, provided that the scheme is submitted to the Department for his approval. After all, the Department already controls so much of what happens in local government that a bit more is unlikely to add to the burden.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what happens in Newham, but most local authorities use their capital receipts for internal lending to avoid borrowing from the market, or they put them on deposit in the money market. If local authorities spend more than the due percentage each year, there is clearly an increase in public borrowing, with a consequent adverse effect on interest rates. That is why it is quite reasonable for central government to require a due percentage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the rules are being changed. Under the existing system, a local authority can use all its receipts over a period, even if it is permitted to spend only a certain percentage of its total annual receipts. Now, if my understanding is correct, it will spend 25 per cent. and 75 per cent. will go automatically towards debt reduction. In other words, out of every £100, it will be possible to spend only £25. If my understanding is wrong, no doubt the Minister will tell me, but my point is that a one-year additional delay would at least bring back some equity.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 576</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that he was uncertain about public expenditure, but then he said that he thought it reasonable for a local authority to sell off assets and use the money for some other purpose and not redeem the debt. Somehow the redemption of the debt is not acceptable to him, but that would mean a 100 per cent. increase in public expenditure, because it would involve keeping the old debt on the asset that was sold and spending the money on something else. It is like someone borrowing £10,000 to buy a car, selling the car for £9,000, spending that £9,000 on something else, and saying that there is no increase in his indebtedness or expenditure. It does not work that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain what happens with some people. When their mortgage level drops appreciably below the capital asset against which the mortgage was originally taken out, they often borrow additional money to finance further expenditure. It depends, of course where that expenditure goes. If it is spent on consumer goods, particularly if the goods are imported, there is no overall economic benefit of the economy. If it is invested in assets that appreciate, the overall economic position will improve.<br><br>
It is ludicrous to apply so much of the capital receipts to debt reduction and nor does it seem sensible. For example, it would be absurd for a property owner who receives a certain amount of money back on it to spend all the money on reducing or eliminating the mortgage instead of improving the property when wallpaper was peeling off the wall. I do not understand the economics of doing that. I can see the textbook approach that the Minister has adopted, but I cannot see that it is good economics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, as a matter of principle and policy the Government should be able to determine the level of local government debate? If central government deem that local government expenditure has run totally out of control, they must construct the machinery to control local government expenditure, and, in assessing the total savings that could be made, individual cases may warrant individual attention. The borough of Newham may be one; I do not know. Does the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) accept, that, as a matter of principle, central government have a duty, if they consider it necessary, to control local government expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, to use the words of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks), local authority expenditure were running totally out of control, I might be partially persuaded by his argument but the percentage deviation of overall local authority expenditure is minuscule in comparison with the enormous deviation of national Government expenditure. To suggest that local authority expenditure is out of control is to believe the Government propaganda. It is simply not true. Local authority expenditure is not out of control.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how much local authorities should be able to borrow money and spend. They should be allowed to borrow and spend the sums on which they can afford to repay the interest out of their rate income. It would be a foolish local authority that deliberately attempted to drive itself into bankruptcy or borrowed so much that it forced its rates up to unacceptable levels. [HON. MEMBERS: "What happened in Waltham Forest?"]
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 577</span>
The people of Waltham Forest can use the ballot box if they do not like the authority's financial policies. They can remove that local authority, but the Conservative party dares not trust the people. Local authorities have spent money on schemes that have won them support through the ballot box, not lost it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that why, in almost every by-election in London, Labour local authorities have had swings against them of between 18 per cent. and 22 per cent.? The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) should not say that local authority spending is under control in a Committee that has at least two members who live in the London borough of Ealing. Ealing has operated with its usual alacrity in announcing another rates rise of over 30 per cent. No wonder people are longing for the opportunity to overturn that decision. But it is not merely a parochial matter; local government spending has a major effect on the economy. Therefore, the Government, who are responsible for the economy, have to keep general control over that local authority expenditure. The Labour party did so when in Government, just as much as the Conservative party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: So much for the market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) says, so much for the market. Is the Minister saying that local authority expenditure is out of control?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says yes, and that will be recorded in <i>Hansard.</i> That shows his grasp of economics. If he believes that, he knows nothing. I shall give him the figures later to prove my point.<br><br>
A handful of local authorities is not the same thing as all local authorities, but the Government project on the basis of a handful of local authorities then start banging the alarums and saying that, as everything is out of control and being run by people who are semi-mad, they will step in. That philosophy runs through the whole of the Government's attitude and their policies on local authorities. They have expanded from the individual to the general. It is absurd, unjust, economically inefficient and based on prejudice and ignorance.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has elicited from the Minister something more important than even my hon. Friend realises, when the Minister says that local authority expenditure is out of control. We have known for many years that local authority expenditure has been dramatically cut—but the Government's public expenditure, which they promised to cut in 1979, has shown successive increases until very recently. In other words, the Minister has admitted that Government expenditure is out of control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I honestly believe that the Minister's statement—which is why I wanted it underlined in <i>Hansard</i>—shows a profound lack of knowledge about national economics, never mind the economics of local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 578</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment. I think I have given way sufficiently to the hon. Gentleman. I shall give him plenty of opportunities later, because we can return to this subject. I strongly endorse and support the amendment and trust that the Minister can offer us some hope on the point that it makes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief point to the hon. Members for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I do not know for how long they have been involved in politics individually, but I presume that both were politically active in 1976. I understand that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West was, in fact, a member of the Greater London council at the time. Perhaps he can remember a previous Labour Secretary of State for the Environment who came to the town hall in Manchester—I have told the hon. Gentleman this before—and said quite explicitly to local government in general, "The party is over."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman as he gave way to me. If the hon. Member for Newham, North-West is honourable, he will surely accept that the castigations he has directed against the present Government are applicable to his own party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in a generous mood; I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon. Gentleman more than once, even if not to make this point. Indeed, I now wish I had, because I could have put both the hon. Gentleman and the Committee out of their misery very quickly.<br><br>
When the former Labour Secretary of State for the Environment made that remark, rate support grant was running at 60 per cent. or more of local authority expenditure. It is now running at 46 per cent.—I think that is the figure. That is the big difference. That is where the big switch in expenditure has taken place, and that is why the late Mr. Anthony Crosland said that the party was over.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can twist and turn as much as he wishes. The plain fact is that a previous Administration of a political colour acceptable to the hon. Gentleman decided, as a matter of policy, that local government expenditure had to be curtailed and promptly did that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) had a chance to refresh his memory of the figures? I have done so, and the overspend of local authorities against their cash limits in 1983–84 was £415 million; in 1984–85, £1,072 million; in 1985–86, £997 million and in 1986–87, £329 million. If local authority spending was under control, those overspends would not have occurred. Does my hon. Friend agree that those figures show that local authorities are spending above their cash limits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the Minister. Those figures are absolutely devastating.<br><br>
Labour's is a failed philosophy. It is so easy to spend someone else's money; local government has been doing that for years. The time has come when central Government says, rightly, that the country has needs other than the financing of local government. The appalling waste in local government is beyond imagination.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to the statement made by Anthony Crosland in 1976—that the party was over. I understand that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) was a friend of Anthony Crosland but we should remember one result of that statement in 1976—the hon. Member for Newham, North-West lost his seat on the Greater London council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ungrateful electorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The electorate may have been ungrateful, but the country as a whole was delighted.<br><br>
I was trying to intervene on the hon. Member for Newham, North-West to make a particular point: when I was a councillor, one of the features of local government that disturbed me was the total lack of accountability in connection with the spending of the funds of central government, as opposed to those raised locally.<br><br>
If central government contributes to local expenditure—whether the contribution is 60 per cent., 44 per cent. or 4·4 per cent. is irrelevant—it must have a say in how its contribution is spent. He who pays the piper calls the tune. If local government wishes to shake off what it sees as the shackles of central government, it has to assume some responsibility, as it did many years ago. As long as the imbecilities of many of the London boroughs and of Manchester and Liverpool councils—the list is endless—continue, local government cannot complain when central government says, yet again, "The party is over."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) the Minister referred to some London boroughs, and, using their example, said that local government expenditure is out of control.<br><br>
At a previous sitting, I pointed out that the Minister had visited the west Yorkshire area. I understand from the local press that he met the leader of Wakefield metropolitan district council, and told him how well the Wakefield local authority was run, and how splendidly the district was administered by a Labour-controlled authority. Why does the Minister never refer to those councils? If what I am saying is untrue, will the Minister please correct me now? If it is true, that the Minister said that, we should have it on record that there are Labour-controlled authorities whose expenditure is not out of control and which administer their areas in the best interests of the electorate. Of the 63 Wakefield councillors, 56 are members of the Labour party. That speaks volumes about the way in which local government is run in our area. Does the Minister remember the occasion to which I refer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that I met members of Wakefield district council. It has always been my purpose to compliment people who run a good show—whatever party they come from. When I described the London borough of Brent I compared it not with a Tory authority but with the London borough of Barking and Dagenham. I did that purposely. I sought to show that there are many well-run authorities, irrespective of the party that runs them.<br><br>
What is sad, however, is that a number of authorities are very badly run indeed, and some of those happen to be in London. They damage the most vulnerable people in their community. I should love a group of councillors from Wakefield to come to Brent or Haringey or to Hammersmith and Fulham. I should like them to visit
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
Ealing before the same happens there. The Wakefield councillors will then be able to tell other Labour party members how their party's reputation in local government is being ruined because of the appalling way in which Camden, Islington and other London local authorities are run. But they must do so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need not go to a London borough. We could invite councillors from Bradford to look at Wakefield. They could learn some lessons from the way in which Wakefield local authority is run. If Bradford is so great under the Tories, why do they always hang on to the casting vote of the mayor? If Bradford were as successful as Conservative members suggest, it would be in the same position as Wakefield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) mentioned Bradford, but perhaps he is not aware that its councillors were so impressed by the borough of Knowsley, which I have the honour to represent, that they poached our chief executive. I believe that the transfer fee is even greater than that for Ian Rush.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going very wide of the subject. I ask hon. Members to relate their comments to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Hunt. My hon. Friend introduced the subject and no doubt Mr. Penn will be asked to advise Bradford council on its capital programme.<br><br>
Incidentally, I understand that the staff in Mr. Penn's department have already made a collection for a going-away present of a copy of "The Satanic Verses".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I cannot comment on that, Mr. Hunt.<br><br>
If Wakefield is as well run and efficient as the Minister suggested, why is he denying the council the opportunity of a further year, as proposed in the amendment? If he had discussed the matter with the leader of Wakefield district council, councillor Pearman would have supported an extension as being of tremendous value to an authority that is run so efficiently. If the Minister believes that there is no justification for allowing Wakefield district council an extra year, perhaps he will explain why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Councillor Pearman did not even ask me for that extension, so it cannot be a very pressing requirement. I have such respect for him that I am sure that he will be able to deal with the matter without the difficulties envisaged by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien).<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on the fact that I made a non-party political comparison—between one Labour council and another—whereas he made a party-political comment about Bradford. I hope that we may go arm in arm by making the non-party political point that we want efficient local government. It is a pity that we have so little of it, especially in London.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the Minister's comment. Part IV applies to all local authorities, not simply to a few Labour-controlled local authorities. Tory-controlled local authorities also support the amendment because they believe that instead of bringing the shutters down immediately, it would be of enormous value to all local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
authorities if time were provided to make adjustments and provision. That is the background against which we have tabled the amendment.<br><br>
There are other examples of local authorities being well run. A profit is made in the public works department of Wakefield each year to help supplement the rates and reduce rate increases.<br><br>
The Minister should realise that when the Bill is enacted, local authorities will not have the opportunity to make the necessary provisions. He referred to efficient authorities and Councillor Pearman. I remind him of our discussions. The Minister should give Councellor Pearman credit for not being the sort of person who would enter into such a dialogue when discussing the matter generally, although he is interested in what is happening in Committee. Local authorities will suffer much more under the Bill, and Councillor Pearman and others would welcome an extended period of one year, which is all that we seek in the amendment.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider the serious problems that will face local authorities if the Bill remains unamended. I appeal to the Minister and his hon. Friends to support our constructive amendment which will benefit local government and assist central Government in making the necessary adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the amendment from the Welsh point of view. Most local authorities, in the Principality if not all, would welcome an amendment to part IV of the Bill. Far from restricting and reducing capital expenditure by local authorities, we must accept that there is a distinct need to increase it in some areas. On housing estates, especially those that were built between the wars, the need for capitalised repairs is becoming more evident as the years pass. As forecast, the more houses are sold off under the right-to-buy legislation, the worse are the houses that remain. Those houses need to be repaired in character. In addition, 70,000 people in Wales are waiting for council houses. Instead of ploughing back capital receipts into redeeming debt, we should use them to build more houses for those who require rented accommodation.<br><br>
Recently the Secretary of State for the Environment, prompted by the Prime Minister, referred to the need to clean up our villages, towns and cities and had the cheek to say that he would introduce legislation next year to force local authorities to make our towns cleaner. Local authorities do not need to be forced to do that; they need the money to do it. If they were given both the capital and revenue moneys to clean up Britain, they would do it. Those exhortations made by the Secretary of State in an attempt to make political capital ring hollow. Local authorities want the means and resources to improve the environment. We need only consider the state of roads in England and Wales. They are full of holes and the grass verges need to be cut. Such activity has declined because local authorities have been underfunded in both capital and revenue during the past 10 years.<br><br>
I am amazed by the Government's hypocrisy. On the one hand, they advance the capital receipt argument for local authorities while, on the other, the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office exhort the new town development corporations to use their capital receipts not to redeem debts, but to run the development corporations.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
For example, in Cwmbran, the corporation used capital receipts to build factories, roads and other important developments. The Cwmbran local authority was told not to use its capital receipts for such work, but the development corporation was exhorted to do precisely that. The Government should be ashamed of that double standard.<br><br>
After a decade in government, why have the Government now decided that local authority capital receipts must be used to redeem debt? After all, 10 years in the life of a council house or any capital expenditure is a relatively long time. Surely, if the debt problems were so pressing, one of the first laws that the Government would have introduced would have related to capital expenditure. We are aware of the Government's need to ensure that their supporters believe that they will continue to restrict the activities of local authorities, especially in London. Such action has a ripple effect, so good, responsible local authorities throughout Britain will suffer. Over the past few months, the Government have expressed their ideological determination about a handful of local authorities. That will result in the entire regime of local authority capital expenditure being threatened. I urge the Committee to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to focus the Committee's attention on the precise terms of the amendment. It is inevitable that Ministers will respond to an amendment that seeks to delay the implementation of such proposals by saying that local authorities must know where they stand and so on. From the Government's point of view, there will always be a pressing need to proceed with any changes that they introduce. That is true, irrespective of the legislation or of the arguments advanced against it.<br><br>
The changes introduced in the Bill are an attack on the rights and independence, not so much of local authorities but of local people with regard to how their money can be used. I am worried about the impact on local authorities of the changes if they are implemented precipitately. The Minister will be aware of the length of time that it has taken the Government to introduce changes to the system. Four and a half years ago, they made it clear that they wished to introduce changes. They withdrew one set of changes and have now come up with another set, which they wish to enforce in a few months' time.<br><br>
It is difficult for local authorities, which must undertake long-term capital investment planning, to respond quickly to changes and ensure that they will work. It is as much in the interest of the Minister as of local authorities that such changes are made to work. I doubt whether they will. I suspect that, in the not too distant future, Bills will be introduced—either by the Government or, hopefully, by a different Government—to reverse many of these provisions. The restrictions are too drastic. They will not allow the flexibility that is needed. In so far as it is possible to make the changes work, however, it is in the interest of the Minister and the rest of us to ensure that time is given to allow local authorities to bring them in coherently. To rush the changes through will cause instability and uncertainty, and will not help local authorities to serve ratepayers, then poll tax payers, to the best of their ability.<br><br>
In particular, I am worried that the Minister is writing into the Bill, in at least nine clauses in part IV, regulations covering important issues about which local authorities will need to know details before they can draw up plans.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
When does the Minister envisage the publication of the details that are left to his regulatory powers, so that local authorities can start to act on them? The Bill is to be passed by October, but I do not see how local authorities can respond properly to issues that we cannot even debate today, because we do not know how they will be formulated.<br><br>
We want to know when the Minister expects details of how the changes will operate in practice and when we shall get illustrations of their impact on local authorities. When will local authorities be told about the Minister's projections for the timing of the transfer of resources between authorities, and the impact that that will have? They need to know that so that the changes proposed by the Minister can be made to work.<br><br>
I find it hard to believe that the changes will work properly. I certainly do not believe that local authorities will maintain due independence and the ability to invest in local needs. The Minister will agree that these are enormous changes. They are technical and will be difficult to operate, like all financial policies. Detailed information does not appear in the Bill, nor in any letters that the Minister has yet written, nor in articles that have been written about the Bill. I suspect that no decision has yet been made about the details, and that civil servants are still trying to work out how the measure will operate. It should not be put into place so quickly. Although, for many reasons, the Minister may be reluctant to accept the amendment, he will have to argue hard and explain in considerable detail how the difficulties that I have described will be avoided, if he does not accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave aside the synthetic consternation of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and deal with the startling contribution to the Committee's proceedings from the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). He did untold damage by making an erroneous comparison between local authorities and the private sector.<br><br>
I should dearly like to know where the hon. Gentleman got his information, who has been briefing him from the private sector, and whether he has any experience of workin in the private sector. What the hon. Gentleman said was wrong in every detail. He seems to assume that private companies can predict what will happen over a two to three year period, but he misses the simple point that expenditure can be financed only from profit.<br><br>
There is no comparison in that respect. Any comparison that the hon. Gentleman seeks to draw is completely illusory. He should know—and, I like the majority of Conservative Members of the Committee, am qualified to tell him—that running a private-sector company can vary dramatically from week to week, and almost from day to day. Although private-sector companies may try to predict what will happen in the foreseeable future, they would find that extremely difficult because circumstances change so regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that private companies rely on their profits to cover their expenditure, but do not many small businesses have to balance their initial borrowing against their expenditure and profit? That equation completes the picture.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but whereas some small businesses have the sense not to extend their borrowing to try to balance their books, as my right hon. Friend said, some local authorities continue to borrow as though they can do so in perpetuity, without giving the slightest thought to paying off either the interest or the original capital sums. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was right to intervene because there is a comparison. I only wish that some local authorities would conduct their business in the same way as the more responsible small firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the most ludicrous statement that I have heard in our proceedings. The Minister is comparing local authorities with small companies, but their positions are completely different. Large companies know what their brackets of income will be and what their borrowings are, and their bankers do not keep changing the rules for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should read one or two of the annual reports of some of the largest household name companies, such as ICI, and he would discover that it is impossible accurately to predict what will happen. That suggestion was made to the Committee by the hon. Gentleman and I am telling him that the comparison is completely erroneous.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that about £18·8 billion of work would have to be done on the infrastructure. I should like to know how that figure was put together so that we can examine its breakdown closely, or was it taken from <i>Labour Weekly?</i> There would be a dispute, which I am sure that you would rule out of order, Mr. Hunt, if we were to examine that figure closely.<br><br>
I have travelled the country just as much as the hon. Gentleman, and my right hon. Friend has travelled it more than either of us, and my clear impression is that the infrastructure is a darn sight better than it has been for a considerable time. In the most difficult areas, such as the inner cities, with which I am bound to be more familiar given my responsibilities, much infrastructure work has been done and money has been made available to put it right. In real terms, spending is at a historic level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is out of control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us discuss whether spending is out of control. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government catalogued for the Committee a number of figures from the Department of the Environment, covering a 4-year period. They were incredibly high. Opposition Members have suggested that they show that local government spending is under control, but the last figure quoted by my right hon. Friend was £329 million, so I should love to know how Opposition Members would define out of control.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is not present because that sum is about equivalent to the total that I have in the urban block budget in the Department of the Environment. He and his friends from the Wakefield local authority have been anxious to persuade me to include that body in the programme. It might be possible to extend the amount of assistance that we are making available through the urban programme if more local authorities were more efficient in controlling their finances.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) referred to what Lord Jenkin said when he was Secretary of State, for the Environment, but got it wrong, too. At the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
time, Lord Jenkin undertook that local authorities would be permitted to spend the £3 billion of receipts that they held in 1985, but he did not undertake to permit them to spend all future receipts. By next April, they will have spent £8·5 billion of receipts, so they have done better, by £5·5 billion, than the undertaking implied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that <i>Hansard</i> was wrong to report that the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The receipts are and will remain the property of local authorities."?—[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 December 1984; Vol. 70, c. 308.]</p></blockquote>
Is he claiming that in the Green Paper of January 1986 entitled "Paying for Local Government", paragraph 6.40 does not contain the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities have been given the assurance that this amount"—</p></blockquote>
that is, accumulated receipts—
<br><blockquote><p>"will be available in full over time to justify additional capital expenditure."?</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying that those words are not in his own Department's publication and in <i>Hansard</i>?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest no such thing. The prediction made by the former Secretary of State—now the Lord Jenkins—has been far surpassed. That illustrates and reinforces my argument that even though we try to predict precisely what will happen, we too can get it wrong. But, fortunately, in that respect the figure was higher.<br><br>
We talk about capital receipts which are drawn down by local authorities from, say, the sale of council houses; it is possible for 100 per cent. of those capital receipts to be spent on repairs to existing stock.<br><br>
What fascinated me was to compare the speech of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) with that which could have been made—but was not, probably rightly so—by the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth). The hon. Gentleman is in the fortunate—perhaps I should say strong—position of knowing that the Bill's provisions will probably assist his local authority more than any other. The hon. Gentleman and I know—it is not his fault because he strives strenuously to increase, whenever possible, capital receipts in his area—that it it almost impossible for Knowsley borough council to increase those receipts. Yet the hon. Member for Newham, North-West had the brass neck to make such a speech, when the local authorities more likely to receive high capital receipts would be inner London. He tried to give the impression that Socialist-controlled local authorities were efficient in disposing of the capital receipts that they have drawn down. What nonsense! Only recently have some of those local authorities realised what to do with the capital receipts that they have drawn down. They can spend up to 100 per cent. of the capital receipt moneys on repairing stock or 20 per cent. on new build, if they so wish. In many cases they have not had a clue what to do with the moneys and have tucked them away or have not encouraged the right to buy. But I must not be deflected on to that subject, Mr. Hunt, as no doubt you would rule me out of order.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith asked about capital receipts and the PSBR. When a local authority sells land and receives a capital receipt, that reduces the PSBR or, in today's circumstances—before the Bill is enacted—increases the public sector debt repayment. That is a fact. The PSBR measures what the public sector borrows.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
That is the difference betwen what it spends and receives. Conversely, when an authority spends its receipts, the PSBR is higher than it would have been. The hon. Member for Newham, North-West argued that this is not the case if the receipts are spent in that year. But that is not so. If the receipts have been spent, that increases the authority's expenditure, so the PSBR is higher than it would have been.<br><br>
I shall ask the Committee to reject the amendment, which is probably no great surprise. First, the present capital control system is a crumbling ruin. It serves no one's interests other than those who seek to profit by marketing schemes to avoid it. It certainly has not produced a fair distribution of capital spending power. The hon. Member for Hammersmith knows who is currently drawing in the higher capital receipts. He is in a strong position to know that because he represents a constituency in inner London. If he had a quiet chat with some of his colleagues seated behind him, who come from the midlands, the north or even certain parts of Wales, he would learn that they are experiencing difficulty in achieving high capital receipts. I have already enumerated reasons why that may be so, but at least there is recognition by the Government that it is not exactly a fair distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would extend the deadline by one year. I grant that the Minister has spoken about the new capital finance system, but on 1 April 1990 local authorities will have to deal with the new capital finance system, the poll tax, local financial management in schools, the housing revenue account changes that we have yet to discuss in the Bill, competitive tendering and, in London, the abolition of ILEA and taking over schools. Is that not a programme of overload for local authorities on that date? Is the Minister really saying that he is planning for the systematic breakdown of local administration? Why will the Minister not answer those points?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do that now. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) cannot have it both ways. If he is suggesting that all local authorities are efficient, he cannot say that they cannot deal with a problem of this kind. Certainly a number of reforms are being introduced at that time, but the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Hammersmith talk about this as a new idea that was thought about last week and has to be introduced after April 1990. The truth is that these reforms have been around and talked about for two years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The poll tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People have had even more opportunity to think about the poll tax because it was in the Conservative manifesto in 1987. There has been no shortage of time to discuss in some detail what is proposed and will be brought into effect in 1990.<br><br>
I am saying that the present system will not get any better. It is discredited. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman's friends who are councillors on Leeds city council would accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who brought it in?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be the first to admit that not all Governments get everything absolutely right. For instance, we have been pleasently surprised by our enormous success in drawing down capital receipts. When we introduced the policy of right to buy, the most
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0744">Image</span>

optimistic Conservative Minister at that time would never have predicted that it would have drawn down such considerable funding in capital receipts, which has benefited not only local authorities, but Government Departments, particularly the Department of the Environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been honest in conceding that the present system, which was brought in by the Government, is discredited. There is no disagreement about that. It is a lousy system. Will the Minister tell us why there have been so many attempts—Green Papers, White Papers, laws, regulations and so on—which have all failed to the extent that the Minister must try again now? How many tries will the Minister need before he gets it right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that one of the answers—and only one of the answers—is that we have consistently tried to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have moved the goalposts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes we have had to move the goal posts because some local authorities have been incredibly devious in finding ways round the controls that we put into statutes and thought were important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one reason for moving the goalposts is that some local authorities start to play a totally different game? The game that they play does not obey any of the rules. One notable local authority in London managed to lease off its town hall and parking meters and is now paying the cost by having to increase its rates by 60 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend makes a very good point. It is not cricket; it is more like rugby. The trouble is that some local authorities controlled by Socialists have lost the ball at times. We have had to move—I admit it—almost on a monthly basis to make statements on the Floor of the House to block devious means of trying to circumvent laws that are slapped on the statute book.<br><br>
I confess—I am sorry that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is not here—that we are not talking about all local authorities. We keep saying that. But there are sufficient local authorities trying to make nonsense of the law for us to take steps to correct that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a great play of his opposition to local authorities finding ways of dodging controls, particularly when they relate to capital, but could he explain why his predecessors, particularly Patrick Jenkin, spent a lot of time and used a lot of officials' time advising Liverpool city council exactly how to make those evasions of controls?</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I was not privy to what was said by my noble Friend at that time. I am staggered that the hon. Gentleman should refer to Liverpool in any way. I intended to draw an analogy between what is happening in Liverpool now—which I consider inefficient financial management—and what is happening in the authority on its doorstep, Knowsley. Just as my right hon. Friend said of Wakefield, I consider that Knowsley is doing many things that could be regarded as a model for financial management in local authorities. That is why Bradford city council has asked if it can have Knowsley's chief executive, Mr. Richard Penn. I consider him a great asset and have nothing but the highest admiration for him.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
The second reason why I believe that these issues should be introduced and considered at the same time is that we are not convinced that the change to the new system will result in uncertainty. I accept that change involves some adjustment, which must be planned for. Our proposals for capital finance were set out in detail in July 1988, almost two years before their proposed introduction.<br><br>
Much has been said about the uncertainty facing local authorities over their capital spending in 1990–91. That is overstated. Under the present system, local authorities have a reasonable idea of their spending power from capital receipts for some time ahead. They learn about their capital allocation only three months before the start of the year. We have made it clear since the consultation paper was produced that we propose under the new system that local authorities can spend from receipt. Therefore, authorities should be able to work out the implications of the proposals for their capital programme.<br><br>
For those reasons, I do not understand the remarks of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). He is asking my right hon. Friend and me to give exemplifications of what will happen. I believe that each borough treasurer or the director of finance in each local authority knows exactly what the implications of these proposals are for capital expenditure, even if the hon. Gentleman does not. However, if he would like me to examine specific details more carefully, I shall be happy to do that and come back to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that metropolitan treasurers have consulted the Secretary of State and say what he thinks about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of such consultations. Treasurers may have made representations to officials in the Department, but I am not sure that they have consulted Ministers. It would be interesting to hear what they said. My right hon. Friend would consider their suggestions most carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a long, but useful debate. It has confirmed that the Government's view of local authorities and their expenditure is, basically, "Don't do what we do; do as we tell you." Their practice was to increase public expenditure dramatically throughout the first seven or eight years of the 1980s while forcing local authorities to make cuts, even though their policies were put before the local electorate and voted for by them.<br><br>
The Minister's reply was not so much disappointing, as in line with his usual approach. He muddies the water in the hope that no one will see what is happening. That is why he spoke about local authorities and small companies. To suggest that a local authority is anything like a small company is ludicrous. There are real similarities between local authorities and middle-range or large companies. On that basis, the financial analogies are appropriate.<br><br>
Large companies know their borrowing requirement over a period of years and know the rules and regulations for that borrowing. They also know what their general income will be because they can predict their economic performance. We know that such predictions are not absolutely accurate. Local authorities know that, but they also know that, generally speaking, they can get the figures within certain parameters. Even under a Government who get the economy into this mess, with interest rates going through the roof, councils can predict their performance to some extent. Their position is similar to that of private companies.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 589</span>
On occasion after occasion the Government have said, "Local authorities must become more commercially minded and their business practices must be more like those of the private sector." Then they tell councils, "You can't behave like the private sector. You can't even expect the rules to stay the same from one day to the next."<br><br>
The Minister seemed confused about the figures. The figure of £18·8 billion was given in a report by his Department in November 1985 on renovation and repair work on council housing, and it came from the stock condition inquiry. The Minister asked whether the figures came from <i>Labour Weekly.</i> To the best of my knowledge <i>Labour Weekly</i> is not published by the Department of the Environment, nor is it subtitled, "The stock condition inquiry". Unless the Minister says that the figure is wrong, it is the one that the Government have concluded is right. It is the Minister's figure, not mine.<br><br>
The Minister is perhaps less confused about the figure of £15 billion. It comes from the Audit Commission's report of 1985 on capital expenditure controls in England and Wales, which estimated a backlog of capital work generally of £15 billion. Good magazine though <i>Labour Weekly</i> is, it is not an Audit Commission report, nor is it published at the Audit Commission's headquarters.<br><br>
On the quotation from Lord Jenkin and the Green Paper we saw the Minister at his best. He became a used car salesman. When we asked why the steering wheel moved 6 in or 8 in right or left without the front wheels moving, he jammed his foot against a front tyre and said, "But have you seen how the windscreen wipers operate the headlights as well?" The Minister's ploy is typical. Then we said, "But just a minute, last week the other salesman, Patrick Jenkin, said that I should look at the underside of a car before I bought it. May I check please?" The Minister replied, "Look at the finish on this," as he huffed on the paint and rubbed it with his sleeve to give it that extra bit of tone. Then we noticed some speckly brown marks in the paint and realised that they were not a colourful decoration and that the new salesman was not the latest member of the team, but the Minister himself.<br><br>
The Minister is busily saying, "You can forget what Lord Jenkin said in the Green Paper. It is a bit embarrassing really, and I don't want to refer to it. If you've caught me out, you need not buy the car." Unfortunately, we shall be forced to ride in the car while the Minister drives, which is even more worrying. I suspect that he and the Secretary of State will wobble the wheel backwards and forwards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regardless of what is on the road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The Minister does not know whether he has to turn the wheel 10 deg or 15 deg before it affects the steering. He will pump up and down on the brakes. When they do not work properly he will say, "Don't worry. Trust me. I've got all these regulations between clauses 30 and 57 that I can use whenever I wish." As we see the truck approaching we shall say, "My God. I hope he brings one in quickly," but he has not got any and, if he has, they are not effective.<br><br>
As the Minister said in a beautiful slip in the middle of his remarks, the reality is that the present system is discredited. He is dead right. It is a lousy, discredited system, and no one should buy a car from this Minister. He then fell back on the sporting analogy, saying that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
was like rugby. Suddenly he said, "The ball is not there at all." Of course not. Why not? Because the Minister has run on to the field and taken it away, even though the electorate has voted on the system that the Government are supposed to be setting up.<br><br>
The Government are setting up a system that is corrupt and bankrupt. It is corrupt in the loose sense of the word, in that we are being asked to accept rules that are changed and goal posts that are moved. The Minister even accepted that the goal posts were moved at times. There was at least that touch of honesty. I remember someone who tried to sell me a house where one of the ceilings was slightly bowed inwards. When I pointed it out, he said, "I was hoping that you would not notice that, but don't you think that it gives the house a bit of an old-world look?" I replied, "All right. If you thatch it, I'll have it."<br><br>
The Minister is acquiring that reputation—as are the Government. No one believes them. They should just stand up and admit, "We don't like local government. We want to constrain it. We want to take it over and run it ourselves." They do not want to see local people getting what they want.<br><br>
We have tabled a useful amendment, which we intend to press to a Division. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to return to the subject later.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 37, line 46, after 'and', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(jj) the metropolitan police district'.</p></blockquote>
Our aim is to include the Metropolitan police in the new control system. As I think the Minister will know, the force is the subject of a parliamentary question. The Bill excludes the police from any system of capital controls—in other words, the police can spend without accountability.<br><br>
This is an appropriate moment at which to raise the issue, because last night's "World in Action" programme dealt with allegations of corruption by the senior Scotland Yard detective, Mr. Tony Lundy. He was named in that programme and on previous occasions, and was the subject of a criminal caution by senior officers in Scotland Yard. I raise the issue because it is a classic example and one with which I have been involved for a number of years. We have known for some time about the corruption and the importation of cocaine and about the connivance of a senior officer.<br><br>
The problem is that it has been difficult to get a proper system of accountability. I asked parliamentary questions, as did other hon. Members, about the reward system, about which serious allegations have been made, and other matters.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0746">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
12 noon<br><br>
Two options are open to the Government. They can introduce a system of containing the expenditure—an answer dated 23 March to a parliamentary question suggests that the Home Secretary is considering that option—and also a proper system of accountability. It is unacceptable that at present the Metropolitan police is accountable only in a small way. In general, its management of finance—I leave aside the more serious matter of corruption—has not been good.<br><br>
The Minister might like to take his praise of local authorities further and recall that a few years ago the Metropolitan police receiver approached the London Boroughs Association, which is Labour dominated, and sought its advice on how best to manage its finances. That advice was taken and since then the system has been regarded as considerably better than it used to be, but there is still the trap that the law and order services have been free of significant capital constraints but local authorities have not.<br><br>
It says something about the Government's sense of priorities that they are prepared to spend a fortune on police, prisons and heaven knows what else while they are happy to let the system that prevents crime and tackles the social problems that lead to crime run down and be undermined. Crime prevention and other schemes designed to keep young people out of trouble and off the streets and to stop them from becoming homeless and drifting into drug and alcohol abuse have been cut or reduced. The consequences are the continuing rise of violent crime at the end of the 1980s, when, predictably, there has been a drop in the crime rate of casual property crime because the age group that commits those crimes is a declining proportion of the population.<br><br>
In parliamentary question No. 394 to the Home Secretary on 23 March, the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) asked about the control on capital expenditure for the police. The Home Secretary said:
<br><blockquote><p>"police, probation and magistrates courts services should generally be subject to capital control system applicable to all local authorities proposed in the Local Government and Housing Bill."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 23 March 1980; Vol. 149, c. 806.]</p></blockquote>
What troubles me is that capital grants will be restricted to Government-approved projects. It is another example of the Government stepping in and saying, "Well, we will approve this. All that other people, including poll tax payers, will have to do is pay up." In other words, they pay up and shut up because they are not allowed to ask any effective questions about police accountability.<br><br>
A problem facing every London Member of Parliament is that our questions about the police—I include the serious matter of corruption, which is now out in the open—have not received effective answers from the Home Secretary. That is not because the Home Secretary is involved in a cover-up. I believe that he did not know how serious the issue was. However, warnings were given some time ago. The problem is that the Home Secretary has so much on his plate that it is nonsense to expect him to oversee day-to-day issues affecting the Metropolitan police.<br><br>
Those issues make it necessary to set up a body to be held accountable for matters such as policy directives, reward payments and the link between senior officers and criminals who give information—that is one of the most
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
important and touchy subjects in policing. Something has gone seriously wrong in this case and it must be dealt with. That will come up in other ways and at other times. However, it is relevant to this amendment, because we are being asked to deal with the financing of the Metropolitan police when those who control the finances and the general policy are, as I have shown, largely unaccountable to any elected authority or, indeed, to anyone who would be answerable in public. That system must change.<br><br>
The "World in Action" programme yesterday, in which I was involved, showed how serious it can be when the system is out of control. As I told the Minister a few moments ago, the London boroughs did the Metropolitan police a service when they offered advice to the receiver on the better use of accounting measures and modern procedures. That advice was taken up, and it improved the situation marginally, but there is still a long way to go.<br><br>
In view of the Home Secretary's reply to the parliamentary Question on 23 March, will the Minister tell us how he envisages the system working for the police, the probation service and magistrates courts, and whether all projects will need the Home Secretary's approval? I presume that the Home Secretary will decide. Will local government Ministers have any say? How shall we deal with the situation where the police try to develop something, perhaps in conjunction with a local authority—it may be a crime prevention scheme, or something of that nature—which requires some property to be bought? Must that go all the way up for a Ministerial decision before the police and the local authority can act?<br><br>
Especially since the abolition of the metropolitan authorities, the police have increasingly concluded that good crime prevention is not possible without local authority involvement. That is something that the Labour party has been trying to tell the Government for many years. It is working tolerably well in some areas although, frankly, not as well as it once did—largely because the Government keep changing the rules. But if projects such as crime prevention schemes and victim support schemes cannot have police involvement or financial support because the scheme must first go to the Secretary of State for approval, the procedure will be bureaucratic and cumbersome beyond belief. Largely as a result of the answer to the parliamentary Question on 23 March, the Minister should explain the Government's thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends, especially those in London, are very conscious that the Metropolitan police is always treated totally differently, and far more favourably, than London local authorities. It strikes us as unjust. We hear a great deal of talk from the Conservative party in this Committee and elsewhere, about accounting practices within local authorities. One never hears a Conservative Member speak about the accountancy responsibility and accounting practices within the Metropolitan police, yet the Audit Commission has made it clear that the accountancy practices of the Metropolitan police leave a great deal to be desired.<br><br>
London Members are right to question whether we truly get value for money from the Metropolitan police. We certainly have to pay a great deal for its services. We also have to pay for a great many of the services that the Metropolitan police provides on a national basis—services that are in no way related to local authority functions, but for which the London ratepayer has to foot the bill. It is something that worries us greatly, because precepting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
authorities are obviously those over whose demands the local authority has no control. Where there is no control and no accountability, one can clearly understand that feelings of injustice arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Greater London council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has just mentioned the Greater London council, yet at the time he was arguing along much the same lines as I am now about the relationship between the precepting and the rate-raising authorities. Whereas the GLC was democratically controlled and accountable, the Metropolitan police most certainly is not. We have advanced that argument many times in the House, and we shall return to it until it is won—as it will be—and legislation is introduced to give us a police authority for London.<br><br>
What is good enough for cities and areas outside the capital should be good enough for London and we should have a directly elected police authority. That argument enters into the debate. Why is the Metropolitan police treated separately, differently and favourably by the Government when they must know that their control over it is minimal? There is the preposterous notion that the police authority for London is the Home Secretary. That is a constitutional myth. The reality is that the House has no say over the precept for the Metropolitan police. Every now and then we are allowed a debate on the force on a Friday; that is all. That is the reality of the control over the Metropolitan police that the House is supposed to exercise through the Home Secretary.<br><br>
The proposed borough and general rates for 1988–89 show that the Metropolitan police precept is to increase by 14·42 per cent. That is considerably larger than the increase for many London boroughs, including my own. When we criticise the amount of attention that we get from the Metropolitan police—we do not believe it is good enough in a borough that suffers from so much crime, including racial harassment, burglaries and car thefts—the police say, "Well, we do not have enough people." We understand that, but how can we influence decisions about the deployment of personnel in the Metropolitan police? We are told, "It is nothing to do with you; that is not your job. That is the job of the Commissioner and the Home Secretary." We have to foot the bill, but we are allowed no say in the deployment or the priorities of the police force.<br><br>
Before any hon. Member takes up my argument and runs with it, Mr. Hunt—it is a complete diversion—I hasten to add that the Labour party has never said that it is interested in day-to-day control of the Metropolitan police. We are not, any more than are those authorities where police committees are responsible for the police force. The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) said, "He who pays the piper calls the tune." The hon. Gentleman is not in the room, or I would ask him whether he would say the same thing of the Metropolitan police, because although we pay that piper we certainly do not call the tune.<br><br>
What will happen to the precepting authorities under the poll tax? How will the precept be calculated? Will precepting authorities assume that there has been 100 per cent. take up and collection of the poll tax? Otherwise, while a diminishing amount of money is being collected through the poll tax, demands will continue to be put upon
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
us by the precepting authority. This year the Metropolitan police authority is by no means the worst offender: the London Regional Transport precept on local authorities shows a 50 per cent. increase. Our complaints about the services that the police offer London are as nothing in comparison with our complaints about the services that we do not get from LRT.<br><br>
How will the relationship between precepting authorities and local authorities be affected by the poll tax? These questions are crucial. I do not believe that the Minister will accept the amendment—the proposal is far too radical for him—but I hope that he will deal with some of the problems that London local authorities have with the bodies that can precept upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be churlish to suggest that some of the hon. Gentleman's comments have been a rehearsal of a long-standing argument that is relevant enough to the amendment to allow you, Mr. Hunt, to consider it to be in order, but not much more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That reflects on the Chair.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not criticising you, Mr. Hunt, but complimenting the hon. Gentleman on keeping his comments in order. I wonder whether he expects me to go as wide and to discuss the policing of the metropolis and its relationship with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. That is not within my remit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That has never stopped the Minister before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that, but he has not had the opportunity this morning of refreshing his memory of what would stop me and what would not. I try to restrict my views to the subjects for which I am responsible. I am not responsible for the Metropolitan police, for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, or for the way in which the police in London operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to say anything contentious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least the Minister could try.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment draws attention to the fact that the Metropolitan police is treated differently from other precepting police authorities. I do not wish to speak about precepting authorities in general or about London Regional Transport but the hon. Gentleman raised a valid matter in the amendment. Other police authorities will be treated as if they were a local authority. Their projects for capital expenditure, as in the past, will go to the Home Office for agreement. But they will have more flexibility than they have had until now and will be able to spend up to 25 per cent. of their receipts as they wish. That change provides greater flexibility, but agreement to specific projects remains exactly as in the past. The Home Secretary announced that there will be protection against virement. I do not like that word because it is not used outside the Civil Service. It means taking money that was intended for the police authority and using it for something else. The Metropolitan police does not come into that context.<br><br>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is a probing amendment, he wishes me to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
discuss the major issue. The amendment would not achieve the changes that the hon. Gentleman seeks, because the provision covers the regulation of sources of finance available to the authorities to which it applies. The Metropolitan police is already subject to such regulation and the receiver's borrowing is subject to control by my right hon. Friend under the Metropolitan Magistrates Courts Act 1959. The amendment would have no additional effect. Hon. Gentlemen may believe that the Metropolitan police should be subject to the same financial disciplines that are imposed on its municipal counterparts, and that is so under this part of the Bill.<br><br>
In trying to discuss the wider range of matters, I am not pooh-poohing the seriousness of the hon. Gentleman's case. I disagree with him and believe that the policing of the capital city is more properly and sensibly organised at present than it would be in the form proposed by the Opposition. But their opinion is perfectly reasonable and I do not underestimate the force of the long-held view of the hon. Members for Hammersmith and for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks). However, I do not believe that this is the appropriate place to make such a fundamental change. It would be wrong for me to suggest that the Government want to make that change, but if a Government wanted to do it, they would not do so under part IV of a Local Government and Housing Bill.<br><br>
We have tried to maintain the present position. I know that the hon. Member for Hammersmith does not like it, but I suspect that were he to be promoting a change, he would not do so in this context. It is perfectly reasonable for him to uphold his strong views, but I am not sure how to respond to his comments on the "World in Action" programme on television yesterday as we could become involved in complicated matters.<br><br>
The policing of the capital city is difficult and the mechanism by which to control it is not easy. That is best done as it is now and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary must have a particular role. His responsibility to report to Parliament makes him a proper custodian of the special relationship that always exists, even when there is a local police committee which is, at least in part, made up of elected members.<br><br>
I have listened to the views of the hon. Member for Hammersmith about the Metropolitan police. I do not share them. I believe that it is right to continue the present system. If we wished to make a fundamental change, we would do so but, not in this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that if we wished to change the system as my hon. Friend's and I have often suggested, we would not do it under this Bill. I did not expect the Minister to respond to some of my comments, although they were relevant.<br><br>
I certainly do not wish to impose on the police force, the probation service or the courts the lousy system that the Government are imposing on local authorities. I am seeking an element of accountability. The Government cannot be satisfied with the Metropolitan police force being largely unaccountable. About seven or eight years ago, that was regarded as being a rather unusual view and was sometimes described as a loony left view, so it is significant that growing numbers of people now hold it.<br><br>
I have often been involved in debates run by the police college for police officers. I often acted as "the Speaker" to keep the warring factions apart. Significantly, the motion that was most frequently discussed was whether the

Metropolitan police force was unaccountable. In summing up at the end, I found myself saying that we could not say that it was unaccountable but that, clearly, it was far less accountable than most others. Most police forces outside London believe that and a growing number of senior police officers know that the Metropolitan police force is largely unaccountable.<br><br>
That does not necessarily make officers bad or corrupt, but it opens the door to a minority who are and has profound and serious consequences on the relationship between the police and the public. That is one reason why we were in so many difficulties in London in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br><br>
I referred to the "World in Action" case because part of the corruption allegation related to the payment of rewards that were funded by public money. A percentage of the money obtained from ratepayers or taxpayers is given by the police to a known criminal as a reward for his giving information. I understand that the Minister cannot solve the problem, but if I, as a London Member, or my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) tabled a parliamentary question about that use of public money, we would receive the answer—as, indeed, I have—that such a policy is a matter for the Metropolitan police. We accept that such use of taxpayers' money is necessary from time to time, but police officers are the first to say that it is being used in a way that is open to abuse, if it is not watched carefully.<br><br>
When we consider the link in that specific case with the largest ever cocaine importation to Britain, we can understand why taxpayers and ratepayers are suddenly becoming agitated about accountability. The Government do not have the opportunity under the Bill to change the accountability structure of the Metropolitan police in the way in which I have supported over the years. However, they have the ability to ensure that there is some oversight of the way in which money is used by the police, so that it is controlled similarly to the way in which local authority money is controlled. I do not support the system that the Government are imposing on local authorities. But given the major problems that have arisen in the past, it would be a mistake to allow the Bill to proceed without the Government considering the small, but important, accountability problem.<br><br>
I shall not press the amendment to a Division as the reply to the parliamentary question of 23 March has slightly altered the position. I understand the importance of the Minister's remarks and I wish to give him the opportunity to reconsider the matter. If it is appropriate, I shall return to the matter on the Floor of the House. Will the Minister consider the way in which the police force, the probation service and the courts can spend money without being accountable as we usually expect in such legislation? We do not necessarily expect accountability directly to us; other systems of accountability have been established in the past.<br><br>
Under the existing system, aspects of the policy have gone dangerously wrong. The Bill provides the opportunity to change a small but important part of the system. Will the Minister reconsider the matter to see if there are ways in which the problems can be solved and table suitable amendments to the Bill at a later stage? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 244, in page 38, leave out lines 23 and 24.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove the scope of the control of companies, which are
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the influence of an authority".</p></blockquote>
It is an important amendment and refers to the, sometimes, complex relationship between companies, which are set up, operated and influenced by local authorities and the local authorities themselves. Under clause 30(5), the Secretary of State may, by order, apply the provisions of part IV of the Bill to companies
<br><blockquote><p>"under the control of a local authority"</p></blockquote>
or
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the influence of an authority".</p></blockquote>
As the Bill is drafted, a local authority influenced company is one where there is a business relationship between the company and the local authority, and where at least 20 per cent. of the total voting rights of all members who can vote at a general meeting of the company, or at least 20 per cent. of the directors of the company, or at least 20 per cent. of the total voting rights at a meeting of the directors of the company are held by people associated with the local authority. Where more than one local authority has an interest in the company, smaller percentages are aggregated.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
That poses two problems. First, 20 per cent. is a low ceiling at which to bring such a company within the scope of the provisions of part IV. Secondly, the definition of association set out in part V is so widely drawn that a person employed by a firm that has, for example, carried out consultancy work for a local authority within the past four years is deemed to be an associate of that authority. When that four year period has elapsed, that person is no longer such an associate. Given the low threshold involved, the company may then fall outside the influenced category. Will the Minister clarify whether that is the intention? The consultancy example is a good one, and I am not sure whether the Minister and his advisers have considered it. Will he tell us whether the measure would have the effects that I described?<br><br>
Under part V we shall be able to debate definitions of influence more widely, but because of the drafting a company may be an influenced company without being aware of it. That worries local authorities. They are anxious about flexibility and practicability. What would happen where several companies were represented in one company? Not all local authorities financing a company may receive the same level of benefit from that company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman carefully, and I appreciate the manner in which he is moving the amendment, but he has lost me. What does he mean by companies that have representatives? Does he mean local authority representatives on the boards of the companies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I apologise to the Minister—I lost myself, too. It is a complicated area.<br><br>
Not all local authorities financing a company may receive the same level of benefit, so how will expenditure be apportioned? A training company is a common example, and public transport companies may also be. The jobs created by a training company may benefit one particular local authority, but the training company may be funded by a number of local authorities. It is not a straightforward
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
situation in which the responsibilities, costs and percentages can easily be aggregated, as the Bill seems to assume.<br><br>
We want to know why an influenced company—as opposed to a controlled company—should be brought within the system of local authority capital controls. Even the privately financed elements of such a company would count as local authority expenditure. If the Minister is saying that the company should not enjoy the so-called protection of the public sector without capital controls, does he not accept that the Government should increase local authority capital allocation to make provision for local authority companies?<br><br>
The Minister's argument seems to be that there is some form of protection in the public sector, and capital controls should therefore apply, but the Government do not seem willing to make more money available to such companies. As I understand it, the Government are not opposed to such companies, but are trying to restrict them in some way. My worry is that the restrictions proposed in the Bill are complicated. I have difficulty in understanding how they will work. If they are not to have a detrimental effect on training companies, which are such an important part of the measure, the Minister should consider carefully the drafting of the Bill. At best, it is not clear and at worst, it will be constricting.<br><br>
I do not know the views of Conservative local authorities on the matter, but among local authorities generally there seems to be a fear that this part of the Bill is not practical and will not lead to the flexibility and innovation that will be needed, if those companies are to be successful. I ask the Minister to explain how the proposal is likely to work and whether the drafting will ensure that those flexible, innovative structures that cross local authority boundaries when necessary can be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Hammersmith moved the amendment. I acknowledge that it is not merely a probing amendment. He is asking specific questions that I shall endeavour to answer.<br><br>
First, he is correct to believe that the Government are not opposed to such local authority companies. I shall elaborate on the point later, but where they come under the influence of local authorities we propose to treat them for purposes of capital finance in exactly the same way as local authorities. To put it more simply, we firmly believe that the treatment of capital finance should be equal for both local authority companies and local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was also right to suggest that we have made a careful examination of three broad definitions of local authority companies. The first relates to companies that are subject to the formal control of a local authority company. I could probably précis my remarks on that subject as I do not believe that either of us would have difficulty in that regard and could easily define those companies that are under the formal direct control of a local authority.<br><br>
Secondly, a more difficult problem is posed by companies in which local authorities have a dominant influence. That may not prove easy to clarify and I am convinced that we shall return to the subject when discussing a later clause.<br><br>
Thirdly, there are the companies in which a local authority has some other minority interest. We are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
proposing that such companies should be affected by the capital finance proposals, so I hope that that will make the matter easier to understand.<br><br>
The second category presents us with difficulty. By definition, the local authorities' involvement with such companies does not give them formal control. However, such is the flexibility of British company law that it is possible to make arrangements that avoid giving a local authority formal control but effectively give it a dominant influence. Having identified the problem, it was important to decide which companies were so closely under the influence of local authorities that it was necessary to bring them under those controls. We concluded that such difficulties arose whenever there was a combination of two sets of circumstances. First, when there was a close link between the personnel of the authority and the personnel who held votes in a general meeting of the company or were on its board of directors and, secondly, when there was a close business relationship between a local authority and a company which enabled the authority to apply influence on the company. In other words, there would be such a combination of cross-membership between a local authority and a company, with levers in the hands of the authority that it would be reasonable to assume that the company was likely to be acting as an extension of the local authority by other means.<br><br>
We can arrive at a precise definition of those features when we discuss the matter of an influenced company in the debate on clause 58. What now matters is that it is reasonable to treat a company that is so closely linked to a local authority as part of the local authority sector when it comes to the question of local authority capital controls.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) cited an example of what would happen in the case of consultancy with a local authority. He alleged that a consultant to an authority would cease to be such after four years and be classified as associated with the local authority for the purposes of one of the tests of being an influenced company. I am advised that that is wrong; the original consultation document suggested that, but it has been changed as a result of comments received about the Bill.<br><br>
It is difficult to respond to the hon. Gentleman's disagreement about including that provision in the Bill, but from the fair and generous way in which the hon. Gentleman proposed the amendment, I assume that we shall return to those matters later. He would have difficulty trying to influence Conservative Members to take local authority companies with the definitions that I have catalogued out of the capital control system. We have consulted and believe that the criteria for judging whether a local authority company complies are fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) spoke about the inclusion of influenced companies. Conservative Members may be willing to hear of another twist. I do not wish to intrude on the spirit in which my hon. Friend spoke nor on the Minister's response, but local authorities may be faced with a choice. They may either join in partnership with other local authorities, such as in the setting up of a mining trust in Yorkshire, or joining in partnership with private business for the establishment of a company. Local authorities would have to count their capital contributions to those arrangements. They might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
as well not enter such partnerships, but count the contribution as being their own by establishing such undertakings directly.<br><br>
Instead of encouraging partnership and the development of private and public sector enterprise and the sort of developments that, with few exceptions, everyone here would welcome, the definition encompassing influenced companies might have the opposite effect. If a local authority could be caught in the straitjacket of capital constraints, why go to the trouble and administrative difficulty of being involved in an influenced company? That seems quite absurd in what we would otherwise agree to be a valuable coming together of public and private assets and enterprise, which provides for local and regional decision making.<br><br>
Secondly, it would lead to arms-length arrangements, which would not enhance accountability. That would be a mistake, to which we shall return on clause 58 and elsewhere. The problem could be overcome by not using that restrictive definition of influenced. Assets will be so tightly controlled and capital investment so restricted that local authorities will inevitably have to concentrate on essential services which, although dwindling in number, will remain their prime concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that it is not our intention to frustrate worthwhile business ventures that local authorities could get involved in, nor to frustrate joint ventures, which he and I are familiar with and in which his city council has been involved for some time. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that I am familiar with them; we have them on the other side of the Pennines. He will also have heard of or even have visited Lancashire Enterprises Limited, which operates effectively on my doorstep.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Perhaps I should draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the provision for the reserve powers which the Secretary of State wishes, with some justification, to keep to himself. We do not intend to frustrate initiatives which would lead to economic benefits and the creation of wealth and work. We have carefully framed the Bill so that they may continue without undue hindrance. Indeed, clauses 57 and 58 contain the reserve powers for the Secretary of State to direct that either a company or several companies should be exempted from the controls. When we are convinced that the general definitions embrace companies which it would not be appropriate to include, we shall be happy to use that power.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) may feel inclined to leap to his feet to say, "Ah, well. Yet another reserve power which has been kept for the Secretary of State. I have heard it so many times." I appreciate that it may seem like a broken record. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to say that. None the less, I must convince if not Opposition Members at least certain of my hon. Friends that there is the possibility of abuse with local authority companies, even though many have come into the real world and are much more economically viable than when they were first invented. Circumstances have changed considerably. I hope that, given my reassurances, the Opposition Front Bench will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should tell the Minister that broken records can only be thrown away. The records we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 601</span>
are playing here get into the Top Ten. That is why they are repeated, with so much popularity, both inside and outside the House.<br><br>
This part of the Bill will probably haunt the Minister. Earlier today I took him and the Government to task for constantly getting it wrong, and for having to change rules and regulations and introduce new Bills relating to local authorities because they fail to get things right. Having listened to the Minister, I cannot help but feel that he does not understand the sophisticated and technical arrangements that are set up and are different from one local authority area to another. Several different innovative ideas are in danger of being stifled. I accept that the Minister wants the companies to continue, but I fear that some will be lost because the Bill, when enacted, will not give local authorities the flexibility that they require. Sometimes it will be hard for them to work out whether their plans will be allowed or disallowed. If local authorities fear that, they will not act. They will fear that the Government will come down on them in the usual heavy-handed way and they will not initiate a programme. If that is so, especially in training, Britain will lose out yet again.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter. I am not convinced that we have got the wording exactly right. Perhaps we need to reconsider it; I am not sure. But if I were on the receiving end of this complicated part of the Bill as a local authority officer, I should advocate examining carefully any new scheme before it was initiated and, if there was any doubt, that it should not be pursued. That is what will happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole point. I was anxious to avoid any acrimonious difference of opinion on the amendment, as I tried to make clear. The hon. Gentleman suggested that perhaps the Minister did not understand, the "sophisticated and technical arrangements". The trouble is that the Minister understands them all too well. The Minister has had to come across some of those local authorities which have burnt the midnight oil, working out those sophisticated and technical arrangements which are designed to avoid complying with the Government's wish and policy on economic development. As I have come across them, I completely sympathise with what my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State and the Minister of State are trying to do through the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely that intervention, perhaps more than anything else, makes my case. If the Minister really believes that these companies are a good thing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I said exactly the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled, I thought the Minister accepted that it was right for those companies to exist. Presumably, if those companies exist, the Minister thinks that they are a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was the way in which I put the words together when I talked about the enormous difficulties we have had with some local authority companies that were set up some time ago. They were not only non-viable companies; they did peculiar things. When I said to the hon. Gentleman that I understood all too well how sophisticated they were, in fact, in many cases, they were absolute rubbish. It is only because we have brought
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
many of them into line, for example, Lancashire Enterprises Ltd. in the Lancashire county area—with which I am familiar—that they have complied with the Government's idea of economic activity and not that of the Lancashire county council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are doing peculiar things and we have known that for years. This is the most peculiar Government that this country has ever had. The Government are incredibly damaging and one of the areas they damage more than any other is training. What will the Government do here? They will damage training again. The vast majority of companies set up by local authorities are geared to training. Is the Minister saying that to deal with one or two companies that he finds peculiar—although the electorate are happy or not prepared to make a song and dance about them—he needs to take a club to make it difficult for local authorities to do what is primarily a training function? Are the Government now saying that they do not want training?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of conjecture whether the vast majority of local authority companies are dealing with training and we can reserve that discussion for a later date. On that point there may be some dispute between us.<br><br>
The local companies with which I am familiar—they are not confined to my county—got themselves into considerable difficulty in the early stages, and financial control is a problem that they have been facing. I am prepared to concede that when I made an official visit to the West Yorkshire enterprise board it was doing good work in many instances, but others were highly questionable. I can see no reason why that board should not comply with the same capital requirements laid down for local authorities because—and this is the main point—it is merely an extension of that local authority by any definition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to rephrase what I said earlier: not a large majority, but a large proportion are training companies. The issue is not whether the Government take a particular dislike, usually based on political spite, to a local authority or company and try to destroy it in their centralising authoritarian manner. The issue is that the Government will also prevent local authorities from being innovative and making good practical arrangements. My understanding is that the Minister wants those companies because they are a good thing, necessary and desirable. Therefore, the last thing that the Minister should do is to impose a complicated series of constraints to discourage local authorities from even beginning to go down that road. Yet that will be the effect of this measure. It will scare off local authorities. Given that training is vital, and that our training in Britain is well behind that of most of Europe, what are we doing by further constraining local authorities when such a large proportion of these companies are geared to training?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am staggered that the hon. Gentleman keeps using the example of training. He must forgive me for making this party political point, but I find it unbelievable that Opposition Members make such play about local authorities and training when Conservative Members are all too familiar with the attitude of Socialist-controlled local authorities towards employment training. There have been many examples, especially in the north-west, of authorities trying to boycott or jettison it. Because the hon. Member for Hammersmith gave the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
example, let me give him an example which he may even find acceptable, in which case we can come together, and peace, love and harmony may break out in Committee once again.<br><br>
In my constituency, Rossendale borough council is a partner with the Groundwork Trust, in what is known as valley training. I am glad that it is. It is a Labour-controlled authority, although not for long, we hope. It has a minority interest in Groundwork Trust. We support that. It would not fall foul of these proposals, so what is the problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for there to be peace and harmony when Attila the Hun masquerades as a used car salesman. He talks about employment training and does not face the problem, which is that his Department has admitted that there are relatively few abuses. Even if we accept that there are abuses, both of us agree that employment training is a good thing and should be encouraged. We are now embarking on a set of rules and regulations that will so constrain local authorities that if they get it wrong, the consequences will be serious, so they will not take the risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An example of that would surely be the enormous ingenuity of Sheffield city council in ensuring that the whole capital programme for facilities for the World Student Games—amounting to more than £100 million—does not wipe out its capital programme for the next decade. If the council gets it wrong, it will be caught
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
by the Bill, even though it plays only a small part in the overall package. Its officers are therefore walking a tightrope in having to establish and pre-empt the Bill's provisions. They had to anticipate them so that they would not be caught by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has given a good example, and there are many others. The Government will regret what they are doing. I should like the Minister to read his remarks in <i>Hansard,</i> especially his opening words where he was still suggesting that the proposals were a good thing and he was not being ambivalent. We may wish to return to the issue. I hope that the Government will try to appreciate the importance of the training initiatives. If they find time to dwell on this, they will recognise that the dangers of not emphasising training are considerable. Local authorities are giving this emphasis largely in lieu of the Government, who are busy trying to chase private industry, hoping that it will do so instead. Unless a start is made on training, we shall be even more severely disadvantaged.<br><br>
The proposals will frighten local authorities from doing what the Minister professes he wants them to do. He will live to regret his proposals. For the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
