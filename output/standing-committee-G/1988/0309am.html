ASSISTANTS FOR POLITICAL GROUPS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 12, line 13, leave out from beginning to end of line 23 on page 13 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Each relevant authority shall determine the number, remuneration, conditions of service and allocation between political groups of any posts created in pursuance of this section by resolution of the full council.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Each relevant authority shall determine by resolution of full council how the members of the authority are to be treated as divided into political groups and which if any, of those groups shall be allocated a post created pursuant to this section, having regard to any advice of the monitoring officer or the head of the paid service as to the provision of satisfactory support to members.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 97, in page 12, line 35, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
No. 96, in page 14, leave out lines 11 to 21.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would allow authorities to provide support for political groups, subject to the consent of the full council and the advice of the monitoring officer. At our previous sitting, the Committee approved the role of the monitoring officer, and under our amendment the council would have to take note of the monitoring officer's advice on providing support for political groups.<br><br>
Amendment No. 97 would remove the restriction of £13,500, which should not apply in the light of the arrangements for civil servants. On more than one occasion we have been told that the provisions for political and special advisers to local authorities mirror those in Government Departments and in the Civil Service, so referring to those arrangements in our amendments is relevant to our proceedings. The £13,500 limit is not in keeping with arrangements in Government Departments, and it is an anomaly that should be removed.<br><br>
Amendment No. 96 would delete the reference to short-term contracts to provide continuity of employment in line with conditions in the Civil Service.<br><br>
The Widdicombe report accepted that attaching officers to party groups or to leaders of party groups could usefully broaden the basis of advice to officers and promote rather than damage the officer hierarchy serving the whole council. The Widdicombe committee said that allowing the appointment of political and special advisers to provide guidance to political groups on the council and to their leaders could help local government officers and benefit local authority admin-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
istration. We said that the restriction that means that a person has to resign the post after four years, or just before the election of a local authority, is unfair, unjust and cruel, and ought to be deleted.<br><br>
Such officers would not exercise executive authority. We accept that, but feel that they should provide a back-up by research, policy analysis, paper writing and advice to the leader, chairman of committees, or groups of the whole council or of the various committees. Widdicombe suggested that, for most authorities, five such appointments would be adequate.<br><br>
I can understand why Widdicombe considered a group of five. My council, for example, had 66 members. Its political leaders had the task of bringing together 13 former local authorities, a large area of the West Riding county council and two or three rural areas. One can imagine the workload on the administration staff and the political leaders. Widdicombe recommended understandably that special advisers be appointed to advise the political leaders of such large groups.<br><br>
After taking evidence, Widdicombe made a reasoned suggestion that five appointments be made, which is in keeping with the work of larger local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the hon. Gentleman's argument as he related it to the Widdicombe report. Will he confirm that it relates to the unanimous Widdicombe report? The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) spoke about a minority report. I have done some research since Tuesday, and I cannot find anything to suggest that a minority report exists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman's not having an opportunity to obtain the information that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) had from the Widdicombe minority report. The hon. Gentleman has not served as much in local government as my hon. Friend. He is still wet behind the ears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is an ignoramus, but he ought to be aware that I have served 10 years in local government which, at my age, is not too bad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I said. The hon. Gentleman is still wet behind the ears as regards local government. All he has seen is the crash in local government that the Government have brought about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. There is a serious point here. It our previous sitting, the Opposition spokesman mentioned the minority report of the Widdicombe committee. Although we have been sitting today for 10 minutes, we have not heard the Opposition offer to withdraw that misinformation. There appears to be no such report. Is it proper, Mr. Hunt, for us to continue without the report, if it exists, being put before us? If there is no such report, is it not proper that that wrong information be removed from the report?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The content of hon. Members' speeches is a matter for them. This is not a matter for the Chair. I have no doubt that further references will be made to the Widdicombe report. The matter cannot be pursued in points of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you are right, Mr. Hunt. The Minister of State should be the last person to complain about my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside misleading the Committee. On more than one occasion, I have drawn his attention to misquotations and the way in which, in my view, he has misguided the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) said that he had served 10 years in local government. All he has seen is his Government's attack on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has no experience of the 1950s and 1960s when local government genuinely acted on behalf of the people.<br><br>
The Widdicombe report was based on the concept of local government held since the last war and what has happened since—much has happened. I suggest that the hon. Member for Harrow, West reads about local government before throwing his weight about to those who have spent 20 to 30 years in local government service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Hon. Gentleman answer one question? Where is the so-called minority report of Widdicombe, so that we can read about local government? It does not appear to exist. If it does not, will he admit that fact, and ask his hon. Friend the Member for Brightside, who again has left the Committee, why it was quoted, and why reference to it has not been withdrawn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister reads <i>Hansard</i> he will see that my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside referred to the minority report in response to questions from members of the Committee. I am sure that my hon. Friend will repeat his answers if requested to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before unfair and unreasonable attacks are made upon my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), I should say that at present he is chairing one of the policy review groups that he was asked to chair—either he or I had to be there. The Minister of State is lucky this morning—he has me. My hon. Friend will be here shortly. If the Minister wishes to question him, I am sure that he will reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>; Order. Can we now get back to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall adhere to your advice, Mr. Hunt. There is considerable evidence that Government Departments have referred to the way in which special advisers are appointed and to the make up of payment and terms of employment. Information about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
this is available to us in the form of notes on clauses. The note on clause 9 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A precedent for such appointments exists in central Government, where since the 1970s there have been arrangements for special advisers to be appointed to serve Ministers on an overtly political basis and also for back-up to the Opposition party groups and Leaders in the House of Commons, in both cases paid for out of public funds."</p></blockquote>
We are debating the amendments against the backdrop of that precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is an Opposition Front Bench Spokesman? Is there some doubt about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what reading the hon. Member has done. If the hon. Gentleman reads <i>Hansard,</i> he will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has appointed my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside as a Front Bench spokesman on the environment. I am prepared to enlighten Conservative Members at any time on any question they wish to ask about parliamentary procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a great mistake to go too far down that road, not least because the Secretary of State for the Environment seems to be in serious trouble with the Prime Minister at the moment, which is one reason why all the junior Ministers present are also worried about their jobs.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very good point, but I shall not go down that road because it would be wrong to start burying the Secretary of State when the death sentence has not yet been announced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Leader of the Opposition is quite keen on sacking people, and as we are talking about special advisers, I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman might like to consider whether the advisers to his own side of the Committee might be sacked, given that they are feeding the Opposition duff information about minority reports which do not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People being dismissed by the Leader of the Opposition is completely different from people being dismissed on television. The Prime Minister told the Secretary of State that he had made a mistake and that he would have to pay for it, so the money will probably come out of his salary. But we have had enough of that, Mr. Hunt.<br><br>
To return to the amendment, there is evidence from private notice questions and written questions about the establishment of special advisers. We are talking about advisers to local government, but restrictions are being imposed on them. We believe that such tight restrictions will be unfair and will not help local government.<br><br>
In July we were told that there are 30 special political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
advisers to Ministers. We believe that a large local authority should be allowed at least five political advisers. Of the 30 advisers appointed to Government Ministers, with the exception of one perhaps, all are paid more than £13,500; 21 are paid between £13,715 and £40,258. Of those 21, 13 were paid between £22,927 and £33,021 in July 1988. That is twice as much as what we say a political adviser to a local authority should be paid. We consider that the difference is too great and that the Government should have regard to the constraints that will be placed on people who work for local government compared with those who work for central government.<br><br>
The Prime Minister's policy unit adviser receives £48,500, which is three times more than what we are suggesting someone serving a political leader in local government should receive. Imbalance and unfairness therefore exist. We have drawn attention to that because the Government should have regard to fairness and honesty in such issues, and we believe that the Bill's provisions should be adjusted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman help me? Does he agree that the policy unit adviser who advises the Prime Minister of the country—of whatever party—should be paid rather more than someone who advises, say, the Leader of Wakefield metropolitan district council? I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it would not be surprising.<br><br>
Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what sort of difference he would find reasonable and what salary level he would think suitable for, say, the adviser to the leader of Wakefield metropolitan district council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the people who should be allowed to decide the salary level are those who make the appointment. In reply to a question put to the Secretary of State for the Environment on 17 February 1989, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Special advisers are appointed personally by the Minister or Ministers they advise. Appointments are approved by the Prime Minister and an appropriate salary is negotiated between the adviser and the employing department with the approval of the Treasury."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 February 1989; Vol. 147. <i>c. 429.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Why should local government be different? It is the Minister's Secretary of State who says that the principle should be that the people who make the appointment should have the right to negotiate the salary. If it is right for the right, hon. Gentleman to negotiate the salary of his adviser with the person he appoints, why should it be wrong for the leader of Wakefield metropolitan district council to have the same ability, with the advice of the appropriate officer whose appointment was approved during our previous sitting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to argue about that—no doubt I shall when I reply—but it would help the Committee if the hon. Gentleman could give us some idea of the sort of salary that he thinks would be appropriate for an adviser to local government. He has had many years of experience in local government, which we very much respect, and he should know. I use Wakefield district council as an example because I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
know that it is in his area, but he could choose another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the advice given by the hon. Gentleman's Secretary of State is the best advice that we can take—that it is for the appointing Minister or Ministers to agree the salary level.<br><br>
Without knowing the individual's qualifications, experience and terms of employment, how can one say what the salary should be? The Secretary of State suggested that in his reply only a few days ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may not have been present in Committee last Tuesday when the Minister told me, when I was discussing the low pay issue, that it ought to be left to the people concerned to negotiate salaries. One wonders why the Minister has suddenly abandoned that stance since our last sitting. It is a very short time in which to change his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. I am prepared to allow the Minister to intervene further if he wants to reply to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. I think that the Committee would like to have some idea of the sort of figures that we are talking about. The hon. Gentleman is asking us to change a provision and we want to see what effect it would have on public expenditure.<br><br>
Let us take a very highly respected and extremely good adviser such as the former Labour leader on Bradford metropolitan district council who, I believe, was adviser to the leader of Wakefield council. Does the hon. Gentleman consider that he should be paid £40,000 a year, or perhaps £20,000 a year? What sort of figure does he envisage? Perhaps he could give us an idea. It is a reasonable question to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, in local government, there is a proper system of job evaluation? Salaries are not a matter of guesswork, as is the case in private industry. It is clear that the Minister knows very little about local authorities and a great deal about private industry, where salaries are given on the basis of friendship and so on. In local government, there is an established practice of job evaluation. There is a personnel panel that is composed of members of all parties, and there is consultation with trade unions. It would be unfair to ask how much a person's salary should be, because it is clearly evaluated and laid down in local government rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from that reply to the Minister that it is difficult to know what the salary should be without having full details about the applicant. If the Minister is prepared to listen to a reasonable answer to his argument, I shall give him one. In a written answer on 29 July 1988 to a question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham), we are told about a salary scale for special advisers to Ministers at the Department of the Environment on 28 points, from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
1 to 28, starting at £13,715 and rising to £40,258. Perhaps the Bill should say that salaries will be in accordance with that scale, taking account of the applicant's request and the view of the people who conduct the interviews for the jobs.<br><br>
The Minister said that he wanted to know what the effect would be on local government. We have seen the effect on central government; why not allow local government to mirror that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's earlier comments to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) about his experience in local government, I hope that he will accept that mine includes the period to which he referred—the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that, throughtout my 20-odd years in local government, which included being leader of one council and leader of the opposition on another, neither political party felt the need to appoint political advisers?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) talks about salary scales as though one can thumb through a book to find the appropriate amount, but does the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) realise that the appointment of a political adviser is a one off—assuming, in the first place, that there should be such an appointment—and that councils and majority parties can more or less dictate what the salary bracket should be? From beginning to end, it is an exercise in jobs for the boys. The public recognise that, and it is about time that the Labour party did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at that outburst, particularly when one thinks of the number of political advisers who have been appointed by this Government. I advise the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) to tackle his leaders. In July 1988, there were 30 such advisers to the Government that he supports, and the number may have increased since then. I do not know whether he is saying that the principle is wrong, but the notes that have been circulated by the Department say that the precedent exists. I quite understand the hon. Gentleman's confusion when I see the people who are guiding him, but the precedent is there, and it is no use crying when Ministers and their advisers say that they must be appointed. There is no point in the hon. Gentleman complaining now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The logic of the hon. Gentlemen's argument is that because all dogs have four legs, all four-legged animals are dogs. There is a difference between local government, which by definition is local, and national government, which by definition is national. There is no excuse whatever for any leader, whether of the council or of the opposition on the council, to have a political adviser who is paid by ratepayers. If the leader wants advisers, they should be paid by the political parties, not by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p>11.00 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the hon. Gentleman has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
not been listening to the debate. We are talking about special political advisers. Whether the politics are those of central government or local government, they do not change—at least, the politics of the Labour party do not change. The Government that the hon. Gentleman supports say, in the notes issued by the Department of the Environment, that, because the appointments have existed since 1970, the precedent is set and we should accept it. If the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness does not agree with it, why did he not tell Ministers before now? His starting to campaign on that front in the seventh sitting of a Committee shows how naive he is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may return to the hon. Gentleman's earlier comment that he wanted the scale to be the same as that for political advisers. Is he really suggesting that the political adviser to the leader of a council should be paid £40,000 a year? That would happen if that scale were used. Are there any circumstances in which a local government official who advises the leader of a council on a political basis should be paid £40,000 a year? If not, what should be the top level of the salary scale?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that question if the Minister will tell me what his adviser is paid. In a written answer given on 17 February 1989, his boss, the Secretary of State for the Environmnet, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mrs. K. C. Ramsey is my special (political) adviser and Mr. P. R. J. Rock is special (political) adviser to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Water Planning … Special advisers are appointed personally"—</p></blockquote>
I take it, therefore, that the Minister is involved in the appointment—
<br><blockquote><p>"by the Minister or Minsters they advise. Appointments are approved by the Prime Minister and an appropriate salary is negotiated between the adviser the employing department with the approval of the Treasury."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 February 1989; Vol. 147, <i>c.429.</i>]</p></blockquote>
What does the Minster's adviser get?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman thinks that it would be proper to announce the pay of any individual in the House, he does not understand what privacy is about. I have no intention of telling him, but I put this challenge to him. He has offered us a scale on which the top salary is £40,000 a year and, unless he denies if, I shall say publicly that the Labour party is committed to the principle that political advisers to leaders of councils can be paid up to £40,000 a year. That is what the hon. Gentleman said, and unless he withdraws it, we shall be able to advertise it in the county council elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: By the same yardstick, I can say that each of the 30 political advisers who are appointed by the Government get no less than £40,000, and, as I said, some get £48,000. The Minister says that he will not divulge what his advisers get, but he wants me to divulge what the adviser to the leader of Wakefield council gets.<br><br>
What is the difference? On the same premise, while campaigning in the county council elections we can say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
that 30 political advisers to Ministers, including this Minister, get no less than £40,000, and some get more. That is the price that the Government are paying for special political advisers.<br><br>
The Minsiter is afraid—frit—to tell us what his adviser gets, so we can take it that he on the maximum of the scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows, because I said so, that I would not ask him what the leader of Bradford council was paid as a special adviser the the leader of Wakefield because it would be improper. It is a matter for the leader of Wakefield and the leader of Bradford. I told the hon. Gentleman to take the example of a council other than Wakefield so that he would not be in that position.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman knows the salary bands because he has that information. He suggested that local government special advisers should be on a salary scale up to £40,000 a year. I do not want him to tell me in which local authority it would be suitable to pay someone £40,000 a year. Does he think that any special adviser to a local authority should be paid £40,000 a year? If not, what does he think should be the top limit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister obviously wants to widen the issue, but I shall not do so. We know from written answers that special advisers to Government Departments are seconded to the Conservative party Central Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What scale are they on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Twin tracking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If it is right for a Government adviser to the Minister to be on the salary scale from £13,700 to £48,000, why is it wrong for the adviser to the leader of Wakefield council to be paid the same?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must answer the question. Does he think it possible to pay the adviser to a local government leader £40,000 a year? If not, what is the top of his scale? The hon. Gentleman must tell the Committee. There are 1,548 possible special advisers.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's proposal would represent a real cost to public funds. What is the top of his scale? That is a simple question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister talks of real costs to public funds, I draw his attention to the reply to a written question to the Prime Minister. For the year 1988–89, the total cost of political and special advisers to Government Ministers was £246,903. I bet that the cost of political appointments in local government does not exceed that of Government advisers. If the Minister wants to criticise local government appointments, he should remember that his advisers and those of the Secretary of State are the drain on public funds.<br><br>
I shall not pursue the matter because if those people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
are being paid what they are worth I accept it. People should be paid what they are worth, and the same applies in local government. It should be left to those making the appointments — as it is to the Minister — to decide the salary scale. The same applies to the leader of Wakefield or to any other council as it does to the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman answer the question. What is the top of his scale for local government advisers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I told the Minister that it is the scale laid down in the written reply. If that is wrong, let him tell me why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has dug himself an incredible hole — [Hon. Members: "Oh."] not least because £13,500 is not the top of the scale. Under clause 9(4), it is for the Secretary of State to decide whether it should be higher. He may do so by negative instrument in the House. The question should be what is the Minister's top figure. The Secretary of State can, at any time, say, "This should be £100,000." Does the Minister think that it should be £100,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill states that the Secretary of State can decide the salary level. The figure of £13,500 is therefore conjecture. If, for example, a Tory ex-Member of Parliament wanted to be adviser to a Tory leader, the Secretary of State could make the salary higher. It would depend on the affinity between the person applying for the job and the leaders of the Tory party.<br><br>
I am trying to help the Minister to reply to questions. That is difficult these days. I thought that my guidance was fair and a reasonable way of progressing. If the Minister wants to anchor on to the issue, I am prepared to discuss it for as long as he wishes, but I should like to move on because we have a great deal of business to consider.<br><br>
The Minister is embarrassed because we have information from Government Departments and the Prime Minister and I can understand that embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the question. Does the hon. Gentleman deny that the top of his scale for local government special advisers is £40,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer. I shall quote the Minister's words during our fourth sitting. I asked him how he could compare advisers to local government with those who advise central Government and said that was not comparing like with like. The Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If I cannot compare the two, I had better withdraw the suggestion that there should be special advisers in local government. The proposal was made precisely because the two can be compared."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 2 March 1989; c. 132.]</p></blockquote>
I am only using the Minister's words when I compare the pay spine for advisers to Ministers with that for advisers to local government. The Minister told the Committee at 12.15 pm during the fourth sitting that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
they must be compared. Is the Minister now saying that they should not be compared? No one misleads the Committee more than the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman is confirming that £40,000 a year is his top limit for special advisers to local authority councils. That is £74,304,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State decrees, that £40,000 could be £50,000. Local government will not decide the salary. The Minister's gaffer, supported by Tory Members, has the power to decide the salary level. If the Secretary of State says that it will be £40,000, that is what it will be. I did not suggest that figure. The figure came from the Secretary of State. I merely quoted from <i>Hansard</i> when the Minister said that he must compare the two, otherwise he would withdraw the suggestion. I was merely comparing the two, as the Minister did.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) made a splendid intervention when he reminded the Committee that if the Secretary of State wished to increase the figure of £13,500 to £50,000 or £100,000, he had the power so to do. Conservative Members, not the Opposition, have given him that power. If a finger is to be pointed, it should be pointed at the Secretary of State and Ministers.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will not deny that the Secretary of State could increase the amount to whatever he wished—for example, £100,000, £200,000, and so on. Moreover, we know from the Government's history that they have tended to give generous settlements to their Conservative party friends in county elections. Therefore, we can assume that they will be prepared to give more money to Conservative party advisers than in effect, to other political parties. That is how they operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Examples of such patronage to Tory party supporters and ex-Members are more evident now than ever before under this Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister asked the hon. Member for Normanton a series of valid, simple, straightforward questions and the hon. Gentleman has refused to answer. So that there can be no misunderstanding, let me say that the leader of Cumbria county council—a Labour leader—has a political assistant. Tomorrow evening, I shall meet Conservative candidates for the county elections in my constituency. Unless the hon. Gentleman tells us what he thinks should be the correct salary for that political appointment, I shall advise my county councillors, on the basis of what he said, that the Labour party proposes to pay £40,000 to the person who holds that appointment in Cumbria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Gauntlets are being thrown down. If there is anything I like, it is to pick up a guantlet.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
Franks) so wishes, I shall attend his meeting with Tory candidates to discuss with them the matters that he wishes to raise, so that they will get to know what fairness is. I am prepared to go on to any public platform with the hon. Gentleman in his constituency to argue the case. If he will not accept that challenge, he should withdraw his remarks, remain seated and keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will say what train he wishes to catch, he may come as my personal guest. I do not think I can assist him any more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take up that challenge and see the hon. Gentleman after our sitting. The issue must be resolved so that when we come into Committee on Tuesday, the hon. Gentleman will have ready his apology to you, Mr. Hunt, and to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not go as the hon. Gentleman's personal guest of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks) but as his political adviser.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be more apt. The hon. Gentleman has been around a bit. He use to be a member of a party other than the Tory party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been involved for 25 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should remind people of this political weathercock in their midst. When the wind blows another way, who knows he may change direction too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Member for Normanton will delight the citizens of Cumbria. Before so doing, will he vouchsafe to the Committee whether he will tell them that the top of his scale is £40,000, less or more? I am being fair. They will ask him that question, as I have done. I have asked it a dozen times, but still have not received an answer. Is it £40,000? will he tell us now? If he does not, he may perhaps be discourteous to the House of Commons because he would not have given the House that information before giving it to Cumbria and the press.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If anyone is discourteous to the House of commons it is the Prime Minister, who gives information to the press before giving it to the House—Bernard Ingham carries out that job. If the Minister wishes to expose discourtesy, I suggeest that he starts with 10 Downing Street because information comes from there before it comes to the House of Commons. There are various examples of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can return to the point that was being made. What restrictions are placed on the 30 or so advisers to Ministers compared with those to be placed on the political advisers to local government? Just as there are career civil servants who want to look after their future interests, a similar situation will apply in local government. Therefore, the question of a short-term contract for special advisers appointed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
local government should be examined by the Government, because it is not an encouraging feature.<br><br>
Suppose someone who was an adviser to the Secretary of State for the Environment also took a job as adviser to the Tory leader of a local athority. If he accepted the latter post, he would be on a short-term contract, although the post with the Secretary of State might become a short-term contract because, in 1990 or 1991, the Secretary of State will be on the Back Benches. The terms of the contract should be examined, however, because if someone has to resign from the post because of that contract that is surely not in the best interests of democracy and fairness.<br><br>
There are differences between what will apply to those employed as special advisers in local government and what applies in central government. The Widdicombe report specifically referred to the precedent set by central government regarding the arrangements made for special advisers appointed to serve Ministers on a political basis. The report suggested:
<br><blockquote><p>"if the appointment is being made from outside the authority on the basis of the political affiliation or sympathy of the applicant this should be stated so there is a clear distinction between such appointments and those seconded from mainstream local authority staff"</p></blockquote>
In other words, it must be demonstrated that they are special advisers, appointed for a specific job. As such they would be identified as separate from the mainstream of the lcoal authority staff. We should accept that. The Widdicombe committee made a fair assessment, one which I hope that the Government will accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To assist us our understanding of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, was that quote from the majority or the minority report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman was not listening. I note that he is doing his constituency work, but I said, "the Widdicombe report". I quoted from it. Perhaps when my hon. Friend the member for Brightside comes back into Committee he will put that in braille for the hon. Gentleman who obviously cannot see the report before him. It is in the report if he wishes to read it. I advised the Committee that I was quoting from Widdicombe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which bit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, the hon. Gentleman is confused. He is still asleep, but when he wakes up we shall tell him what has happened in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman attacks my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), will he say whether he is referring to the Widdicombe report or to the minority report that he invented earlier? My hon. Friend asked a perfectly reasonable question. If the hon. Gentleman will admit that there is only one report we can proceed. Otherwise, it is difficult for the Committee to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I explain, for the benefit of the Minister and other Conservative Members, that Widdicombe did not publish the minority report? Widdicombe published his report, from which I am quoting.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
If Conservative Members want my answer written on tablets of stone, we shall have it constructed in concrete so that they know exactly what we are talking about. Conservative Members are so vacant that it is difficult to explain things to them.<br><br>
I made it clear that Widdicombe gave certain advice, but then Conversative Members asked, "Did he make those recommedations? Are they from his report?" How much plainer can I make my answer? If we had an overhead projector on which to display the text of the report, we might shine a little light into the eyes of Conservative Members. I am sure that they are fast asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must refer to the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, who only at our previous sitting agreed that there was a minority report to Widdicombe. Is the hon. Gentleman now saying that there is no such minority report? Is there a difference between him and his hon. Friend? Will the hon. Gentleman please tell us whether in the view of the Labour party, there are or are not two Widdicombe reports? At our sitting on 7th March, the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham said clearly that he agreed with the hon. Member for Brightside that there is a minority report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be the telephone wire carrying the message to my hon. Friend, and allow him to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always worried when the Minister furrows his brow ans shows that he is overworking his brain, which is sorely strained at present. First, I am the hon. Member for Hammersmith, although I am happy to take over Fulham as well because it is a Conservative seat.<br><br>
We are not referring to an appended report of dissent. No one has ever said that there was such a report. [Hon. Members: "Oh."] Conservative Members must listen, or they will find it difficult to understand.<br><br>
We have never suggested that there was a report of dissent attached to the Widdicombe report. My hon. Friend the Member for Brightside said that, since the Widdicombe report was published, one of the Committee's members has made a statement that contrasts with the report. Irrespective of whether we call the statement a minority report, it is certainly not a minority report attached to Widdicombe. The Widdicombe report is Cmnd. 9797. Everyone in the Room knows that, although the Minister for Local Government is having a little difficulty understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the end of the saga. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has put it to bed, along with some Conservative Members. We should move on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting most Conservative Members to sleep. I am now confused, although I usually understand what the hon. Gentleman means because we both come from the north.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
Government has said, the first page of the report carries a stipulation, signed by all members of the Committee, that the document is a unanimous report. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is misleading the Committee by suggesting that a minority report would not normally be considered a report of dissent. Every member of the Committee, including the hon. Member for Hammersmith, knows what a minority report is, and Opposition Members have referred only to a minority report; so they have changed their stance already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are witnessing a cover-up by Ministers. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith has explained the matter that has been worrying them since Tuesday. I suppose that they could not rest until they understood to which report my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith referred. Now that that has been explained to them, perhaps I could draw attention to the fact that the Government's proposal is wide of the Widdicombe report. The Minister obviously does not want it to be put on the record, but what we are facing is one law for central government, as agreed and designed in the main by the Secretary of State for the Environment, and another law for local government. All we are saying is that there should be some way in which to draw them closer together.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Let us examine what has happened so far. The Bill requires each local authority to designate a monitoring officer to advise on proper conduct. We believe that it is appropriate to make positive use of the monitoring officer, and that local agreements should be reached having regard to his advice. That is what amendment No. 95 says.<br><br>
As a monitoring officer appointed within the local authority will oversee appointments, salary scales and establishments, the council should take note of his advice when making the political appointments under discussion. That obviously goes beyond what happened when the Minister appointed his adviser. There was no question of a monitoring officer guiding the Minister on that occasion. We believe that the monitoring officer should be involved with the appointment of political and special advisers in local authorities. It would allow for the flexibility in appointments recommended by the Widdicombe committee. Amendment No. 95 would give local authorities that freedom and flexibility.<br><br>
The social services, housing and environmental health departments in Wakefield local authority are large. We believe that consideration should be given to allowing one or two or more of the chairmen to the committees to have an adviser, as well as the leader and deputy leader of the council in such large local authorities.<br><br>
In the past 10 years under this Government, more legislation has been directed at local government than ever has been in any decade in the history of local government. Political decisions made in the House have to be carried out by local councillors in local government, and because of the current political
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
involvement in social services—particularly with the joint funding from health authorities—the Bill's restriction to three appointments should be considered carefully. What used to be a charge on the health authority is now a charge on the local authorities, and councillors need political guidance as to what Government regulations mean and how they should be applied.<br><br>
In the interests of providing a smooth and efficient service in local government, the issue of political advisers should be given serious consideration. Government proposals have to be examined to see whether they apply to social services, housing, planning, environmental health and to the disposal of toxic waste. Environmental health officers will have to play a greater part in the Government's programme to reduce the present amount of food poisoning. There is a great deal more political involvement now, so it is unfair to restrict the number of appointments to three.<br><br>
Amendment No. 97 would remove the ceiling of £13,500. I do not wish to reopen the issue as we have exhausted it. I am prepared to go over it again if members of the Committee wish, but I think that we would be wasting time. My suggestion that local government should mirror central Government is in the best interests of all. On amendment No. 96, I said that fixed-term contracts would not be tolerated by central Government employees and that local government employees should have the same terms and conditions as employees of central Government.<br><br>
The amendments are in line with the spirit of the Widdicombe Committee's recommendations. I have extracted certain proposals from the report and submitted them in the form of amendments. I ask the Committee to accept our amendments. They are moved in the proper spirit, they are constructive and they would benefit local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have learnt a great deal from the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). We now understand the size of his proposition.<br><br>
Originally the Government were not minded to allow special advisers of any kind, which I felt was going too far. In a busy council it is important that both the majority and minority party groups are properly serviced in that they have information available, their agendas are properly drafted and points that might otherwise escape councillors' notice are brought to their attention.<br><br>
I believed that the analogy with special advisers to Government must be taken into account, and Widdicombe did so. If we were to insist on a return to the time when all local government officials were clearly officials of the whole council, not of the ruling section, we had to ensure that the ruling group and the opposition group were properly serviced by someone who was recognised as doing that job, not as dealing with the council as a whole.<br><br>
The compromise was to say that if a council decided to appoint a special adviser for the majority group it had also to provide one for the opposition, and that if there were two significant opposition groups there should be a third figure. That was our idea.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
I have listened to the hon. Member for Normanton defending hs various amendments and I am more concerned now than at the beginning. I remind him that he has just said that in Wakefield, in addition to advisers to the leader and deputy leader, there should be two, three or four other advisers, to the social services committee, the housing committee, the planning committee and the environmental health committee. His amendments, however suggest only five advisers. The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that these political advisers, who would be paid for by ratepayers, should be available only to the Labour group. That is an entirely different proposal. [<i>Interruption.</i>) Well, the figures do not add up otherwise. Five advisers are proposed: one to the leader, one to the deputy leader, and two, three or four others, if the hon. Gentleman consults <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, he will see that that is what he said. He then quoted social services, housing, planning and environmental health, which makes four, plus two leaders. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I will give way to the hon. Gentleman if he intends to say that that is not so. He mentioned all those advisers, and he specified a top limit of five.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister is allowing me to put the record straight. I said that there should be a maximum of five advisers—one each to the leader and deputy leader, and one adviser to one, two or three other chairmen. I mentioned three Committees: social services, environmental health and housing. I suggested that there could be an adviser to one, two or three chairmen. That is two for the main political party, which still leaves three out of the five that I suggested for the other parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation, then, is that there are to be political advisers covering all these committees, and two political advisers to the leader and deputy leader of the council. Are there to be three advisers for the opposition? It seems odd that the ruling party has two advisers and the opposition has three, because the hon. Gentleman suggests five in total. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He mentioned four committees, including planning. Presumably there is to be one adviser to each committee chairman. That is what I and my hon. Friends thought he meant, but I apologise if we are wrong. He suggests that there is to be one adviser to each committee, and one each to the leader and deputy leader. How many political advisers does the hon. Gentleman suggest there should be to the opposition on a council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to Wakefield district council. I suggested that there be an adviser to the leader and to the deputy leader, and perhaps an adviser to one, two or three committee chairmen. I did not mention the planning committee, because Wakefield does not have a big planning department. I also said that there could be up to five political advisers.<br><br>
Some authorities, such as Leeds, are much larger than Wakefield. Therefore there may be a need for a further appointment in the larger authorities. I am not changing the principle, or changing what happens with opposition parties. They can, depending on the number of members in each opposition party, have one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
adviser each, and there would still be room to consider larger authorities. I thought that mentioning a figure of up to five would make sense. If an explanation is needed, I am prepared to give one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We appear to have discovered a new principle, which is that the ruling party should have more advisers than opposition parties. That is an interesting concept and a perfectly reasonable suggestion. At least we now know the intention of the Opposition's amendment.<br><br>
The Member for Normanton said that the purpose was to ensure smooth and efficient service from the committees. There is a fundamental difference between us on that. We believe that smooth and efficient service from a committee is given by officials who work in its department and provide that service for the whole council. We do not see a need for special advisers to provide party political ways of running a committee of a council.<br><br>
A committee is serviced by council officials, as this Committee is serviced by officials of the House. We do not have party political advisers, who are paid by the Government, to service a Standing Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the Minister's advisers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not in order speaking from a sedentary position, but I will answer him. We are not talking about political advisers to Ministers or to leaders of councils. We are talking about his suggestion that leaders of council committees need advisers to ensure smooth and efficient service of the committees. It is disgraceful to suggest that there cannot be smooth and efficient service without party political advisers. That seems to be at the heart of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who in his enthusiasm, has allowed his words to run away with him, must not be upset if they are quoted back at him. I hope that he will read <i>Hansard,</i> not only on this point, but on his denial that he mentioned the planning committee. I have written it on my list and I shall withdraw what I said if I am wrong, but I hope that <i>Hansard</i> will prove me right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stop messing around with words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant), who, so far, has not favoured us with a great deal of his attention, must not shout from a sedentary position. We are not in Haringey council, we are a serious body, so let us discuss the matter properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue to heckle you then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Hunt, that you have ways of dealing with the hon. Gentleman's threat.<br><br>
If we are to take seriously the question of political advisers, we must understand that there is a distinction between them and special advisers. Political advisers give advice in a clearly political sense, whereas in the provision we have in mind the sort of administrative advice that a specialist adviser would give. I do not believe that that advice would necessarily be to a committee, because it would be provided by council officials, not only to the chairman, but to the committee itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At times such as this, the Minister does no credit to himself nor to the House when he indulges in making petty points and in backbiting. It does no good and it helps neither him nor the Committee. May I make it clear that if a point needs to be answered, we want the right hon. Gentleman to answer it. If he tries to pick up and change semantics in a petty and childish way, he will not help the progress of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is an intervention, Mr. Hunt. The hon. Member for Normanton made a serious speech about how he saw political advisers operating. The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) cannot complain if I take up his hon. Friend's words, which, after all, are all that I have to help me understand him. That is not being petty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is not using my words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. I am not being petty. The hon. Gentleman said that chairmen of committees need political advisers to ensure the smooth and efficient service of committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees. I suggest that chairmen do not need advisers for that purpose. That is not petty, it is a serious political point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just said differs from his earlier remarks, but this is not the first time that he has misled the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister said that there was a difference between special advisers and political advisers, but in reply to a written question the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mrs. K. C. Ramsey is my special (political) adviser".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 February 1989; Vol. 14, c. 429.]</p></blockquote>
So she is a special adviser but her post is also political. The Prime Minister's group are all special advisers. It is the Secretary of State and not I who says that special advisers are political.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
kindness of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. When my right hon. Friend referred to special advisers he was replying to a question that, as so often, confused two terms.<br><br>
Sometimes Ministers have to say "poll tax" when we mean "community charge" because Opposition Members ask questions about poll tax. I could quite properly refuse to answer a question on poll tax by saying that we are not introducing a poll tax, but it would be rude and petty to do so and I am not a petty person. Instead I reply, "We are not introducing a poll tax, but if the hon. Gentleman is referring to the community charge this is the answer to his question."<br><br>
Many people incorrectly refer to special advisers as political advisers. The Bill specifically refers to special advisers because they are not political advisers in the sense that the Opposition mean. The Opposition mean party-political figures who even deal in the business of committees, which is anathema and unacceptable to Conservative Members and not something that we want to be paid for out of the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must get the record straight. The question was:
<br><blockquote><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment if he will list the paid political advisers in his private office, their salaries and the procedure for their appointment."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 February 1989; vol. 14, c. 429.]</p></blockquote>
The question does not mention special advisers. We must put on record that it is the Secretary of State and not I who refers to special advisers being political.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is proving my point. A question was asked about political advisers. My right hon. Friend could have replied, "We have no political advisers," which would be strictly true, but that would have been discourteous, not-picking and would have displayed exactly the attitude about which Opposition Members complain. Generously and properly my right hon. Friend assumed that, in referring to political advisers, the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) meant special advisers.<br><br>
In the same way, when Opposition Members refer to the poll tax I courteously assume that, even though their term is wholly inaccurate, they mean the community charge. Rather than nit-picking, Ministers answer the questions that we think have been asked because Opposition Members have the discourtesy to insist on using party-political words in their questions. My right hon. Friend answered the question properly and ensured that everyone understood to what he was referring.<br><br>
The Bill refers to those staff as "assistants for political groups"—a perfectly reasonable phrase which means exactly what it says. The staff are not to be assistants to committees, which are bodies of the whole council. The concept that the Opposition are trying to introduce shows how different their view is from our own. They appear to believe that ratepayers should pay for party politicians to spend their time advising chairmen of committees on doing their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
important for the smooth running of a committee that its chair is well briefed and knows the issues involved? If so the Minister must surely accept the suggestion that to assist the smooth running of a committee a spcial adviser should assist its chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The chairman of a committee is advised by the committee's officials in order to be well briefed. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) is suggesting that local government officials cannot advise a committee chairman properly and that he must get advice from a party political figure paid for by the ratepayers. It is clear that the cat has been let out of the bag.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Member for Tottenham because I look forward to hearing his reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A special adviser would advise the chair of a committee on, for example, the manifesto put before the electorate. A councillor who is voted in on the basis of a manifesto needs advice on how it can be implemented without conflicting with Government policy or other considerations. It is perfectly proper for an adviser to advise the chair of a committee on the manifesto on which the chair and the members of the majority group in the council were elected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Today's revelation becomes even more interesting. Surely what the hon. Gentleman suggests is exactly what civil servants or local government officers already do. When the chairman of a committee says, "This is the policy that we shall carry out," officials seek to find the best way in which to implement it. They do that for Tories, Liberals, Socialists and for all other parties.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tottenham says that he would not take advice from local government officers and that it should come from party political figures who would advise the chairman of a committee and no one else. The hon. Gentleman gives an interesting insight into Labour local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely perturbed by the remarks of the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant).<br><br>
In 1967 I became leader of Salford city council and chairman of the finance and policy committee, which was the major committee, and I remained chairman until 1972. In our first year we decided, as a political group, to reduce the rates. We took a political decision as politicians. I then relayed the information to my officials and worked closely with the city treasurer and his staff to implement that decision. Throughout my time in local government it never occurred to me that I needed a political appointee to assist me when I had a battery of highly paid officers with technical and professional skills.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government is right. We are seeing a new perspective on how the Labour party envisages local government operating and it is extremely sinister.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that if he had been replaced by a Labour leader of his council—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —the new leader would have told exactly the same officer, "We want to carry out this policy, which is different from that of the previous administration." An officer's job is to carry out policy in the best possible way while warning whatever party is in control of the pitfalls.<br><br>
I shall give an example relating to special advisers, and I hope that the hon. Member for Tottenham will comment on it. I understand that Haringey council is to propose to its education committee that condoms be available for sale to the sixth forms of its schools. Surely this policy, which in my view is appalling, would be laid down by the chairman of the education committee, who would ask the chief education officer to prepare plans to carry it out. The chairman would not need a political adviser to guide him even on such a hare-brained and immoral scheme. The distinction is that the education director would be asked to implement the policy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tottenham said that such decisions, having been made by the politicians, need paid politicians rather than paid independent officers to implement them. That is the distinction between the Government's and the Opposition's views. Not for the first time, the hon. Gentleman revealed the Labour party's real attitude to local government, despite the earlier smooth talking from other Opposition Front Bench spokesmen.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing that I must reveal. In Haringey we in the Labour party were, and are, quite open about our policies. If the Minister knew anything about local government, he would be aware that some local government officers will say that they cannot advise on matters such as racism and sexism. For instance, when I was leader of Haringey council, a chief executive told me that he was unable to advise on those matters. Special advisers could give me as a leader or, say, the chair of the race equality committee specialist advice which the local government officer could not give, in line with the manifesto. That is one example of the use of a special political adviser.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an amazing statement about special advisers. I wonder how that could work in the London borough of Hackney where Ms. Linda Bellos is the chief officer of the equal opportunities committee. Is it being suggested that she could not give advice on such matters? Is it argued that she, as a paid local government officer, is unable to advise the committee and that, in addition to her, there must be a party political figure? I assume, of course, that Ms. Bellos is not such a figure; indeed, that must be so. After all, how could she be — she is an officer. Therefore, she is entirely in the same role as the hon. Gentleman's chief executive at Haringey. Are we being told that the equal opportunities committee in Hackney must have a paid political adviser, even though its chief
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
officer is Ms. Linda Bellos? If that is so, how will such posts be accommodated within the five members proposed by the Opposition? That proposal implies a limited number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As for those in local authorities being advised and guided, will the Minister explain why the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) came to the defence of Bradford city council in early-day motion 491? Harrow, West is nowhere near Bradford yet, instead of the local people being involved it was someone 200 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That cannot possibly be relevant to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have learnt much about how Labour would use—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not mind if I do not give way.<br><br>
We have learnt much about how the Labour party operates. Clearly, it wants to have paid party politicians at every point and does not want to rely on the independent local government officers. The Bill's provision is designed to protect such independent local government officers from the party-politicising of the local government system.<br><br>
The proposals offer opportunities — although many authorities will probably not take them — for up to 1,548 political advisers. Those opportunities are even-handed. They ensure that if the leaders of the majority party want a political adviser, as they would use the term, they can have someone within the terms that are set out in the clause. The person who provides help to the majority party would have that job only if there were a similar assistant to the minority party or parties, if both were of sufficient size.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton has still refused to say how much such advisers would be paid under his scheme. We have clearly said that those posts should not be above the rank of principal officer. Therefore the figure should be £13,500. I repeat my challenge to the hon. Gentleman. Although he has not tabled an amendment for this, he clearly wants us to include in the Bill a salary scale for government special advisers. Therefore, in principle he must be prepared to pay some advisers £40,000 a year. Obviously, he would not think that he could provide many with such a salary, so I shall not repeat the total figure involved if all were paid that sum.<br><br>
The difference between us is not that exemplified in what appear to be a small and simple amendments. It is that the Labour party wants a whole card of political figures, paid for by the ratepayer, on salaries of up to £40,000 a year, to come between it and local government officers. I hope that <i>Local Government Chronicle, Minicipal Journal</i> and other such publications will recognise that fact and put it over, so that everyone knows that the Labour party does not even trust local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
government officers to give it advice on council committees. It wants party political figures to give such advice.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton was uncharacteristically mischievous to suggest that the salaries of individual political advisers, as he calls them, could be raised. There is no question of that happening. The Bill only allows the sum of £13,500, as the maximum, to be raised after a review. That would apply to all special advisers in all authorities. There is no power to raise the amount for one particular authority. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman did not mean to say that, but it is what he implied in some of his more mischievous moments.<br><br>
We are moving away from what we suggested in our response to the Widdicombe committee. We do so because, in response to our White Paper, many arguments were expressed about the need for such special advisers. I was impressed by those arguments, especially those which said that a party political group, given all the complications of other modern and local government legislation, needed someone who could bring together various pieces of information so that it was fully informed. I was impressed by those who argued that, if we did not do that, it would be much more difficult for other local government officers to be seen as entirely impartial.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the balance struck in the clause is the right one. It results from the arguments expressed by those of all political persuasions in local government. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) expressed anxiety, but we can show that we have reacted to pressure from the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties to make such a change. We have done so fairly and reasonably.<br><br>
I am extremely pleased that the debate has shown that the Labour party does not trust independent local government officers but wants its own people pushed in and paid for, not by the Labour party, the trade unions or any partial group but by the poor old ratepayer, who will protect Labour members from the proper advice of independent local government officers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and the the Minister. I wish to discuss separately the three amendments in the group because different arguments apply and I take a different view on each of them.<br><br>
Like the Minister, I came into Committee with the intention of opposing amendment No 95. My view has been reinforced after listening to the hon. Member for Normanton. As for digging one's own hole, it is fair to say that he took a JCB to it. Well, perhaps it would not be fair to say that, as he took an hour to do so. However, the Minister is trying to ensure that all parties get an equal bite at the cherry. It is right to have equal access to information and advice, but as will be clear from amendments that I shall table later, that will not always happen when there are more than three groups or where one small group exercises influence in a balance-of-power role, has the deciding role in any swing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
and may, therefore, need special advice. I shall elaborate on that later.<br><br>
If amendment No. 95 gave councils a power to make alternative decisions where there was no opposition to such alternatives, that would be entirely different. The intention of my amendment No. 116—it was not selected, probably because the wording was a little confused—was to alter the Government's proposal in cases where no councillor opposed the change in rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of his amendment not being selected. It has been grouped with amendment No. 115, to which we shall come later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Hunt. I shall have to sort out my papers.<br><br>
My point is that Labour Members may be right where there is unanimity between parties, but I am not surprised that he way in which they envisage special advisers working is not in the amendment, because I very much doubt whether there would be unanimity between the parties on that. I shall not support the amendment if there is a Division on it.<br><br>
Again, I do not agree with the hon. Member for Normanton on amendment No. 97, and I think that he put the point badly. I envisage no circumstances in which a special adviser to a local authority should be paid £40,000. In many cases, it would mean paying the person the same as the chief executive. That would be quite unreasonable, as I am sure, on reflection, he would agree.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will consider two issues. First, there is the general problem of the person on a short-term contract who has considerable expertise. The salary that the Minister is allowing may not be appropriate for that expertise. In particular, there is the problem of the person who advises the group on financial matters on a part-time basis and who has considerable expertise. On a pro rata basis, under the £13,500 rule, that person could command a considerable sum of money for working one day, a half-day or even less a week.<br><br>
Such a person's party affiliation may be loose or non-existent, but he or she is employed to give technical advice which commands an enormous sum of money in the market. To pay that person at a pro rata rate of £13,500 would involve a financial sacrifice that I do not believe the Minister would expect of him. The Minister may not have considered that. I do not suggest that there is an easy way round the problem, but I hope that he will give it some thought, because it will arise under the rules.<br><br>
I wish to ask two questions about amendment No. 96. I am somewhat confused about what the Minister is doing in the Bill. What is said at lines 11 to 21 on page 14 seems somewhat different from what is said at lines 20 to 35 on page 12. The earlier provision seems to allow special advisers to be appointed for four years on a Scottish council, but for only a year in England. The new provision seems more precise, in that it ties them to election periods. Presumably, if an election changed the complexion of the council, advisers would be re-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
appointed in any case, and that would solve the problem of sorting out the political balance, but as I may have misunderstood the provisions, I hope that the Minister will clarify them.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I want to express my concern that the people with local expertise, who can give the special advice that groups will need—I am not speaking of the political activists who might do the job for little or almost no money—may not be happy with a contract that limits their financial reward. That applies to part-timers with special expertise. Secondly, they will be on a very limited contract—in most cases, it will be for one year. Thirdly, they will be restrained from taking part in any public political activity. It may be difficult to find special advisers of the calibre that the Minister wants, and all councils may end up with the special advisers which Labour Members seem to advocate and which the Minister does not want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) accused me of being asleep. I can assure him that Conservative Members find it absolutely impossible to sleep during one of his witty, amusing and brief speeches but, unlike Opposition Members, at least we turn up for them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman took a great deal of interest in my career in local government. Indeed, he told the Committee that I had not had a career in local government. That shows how much careful research that he does. I accept that, compared with his fine record in local government, 10 years is not very long, but I plead guilty to having a problem in that I could not start my career in local government until I was 21, which limited the number of years that I could put into it.<br><br>
We have had an interesting example of the way in which the hon. Member for Normanton is wrong. He told us that the only people who can comment on what goes on in local government, and on clause 9 are those who have long experience of it, like him, and certainly not anyone who is wet behind the ears, as he described me. Anyone who compares the speech of the hon. Member for Normanton with that of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), who is considerably younger than I am, would have to conclude that the latter had given the matter serious and honest consideration and raised points that were telling and deserved to be answered, while in nearly an hour the hon. Member for Normanton did not say anything that was worthwhile.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend make sure that his remarks are sent to the Cornish press?

Member for Truro were outrageous—(<i>[Laughter].</i>—and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will object to them. Nevertheless, the hon.

The hon. Member for Normanton said that my experience was only under a Conservative Government. He may not know this, but between 1974 and 1978 I was a member of the London borough of Hounslow, when a Labour Government was in office, and I remember the cuts that were made in our budget and the interference in our decisions by Secretaries of State for the Environment and Ministers whose decisions the hon. Gentleman no doubt applauded. Tasks were loaded on the local authority, but it could not carry them out because of the inadequacy of the resources that were made available to it.<br><br>
It is dishonest of the hon. Member for Normanton to pretend that things are different in this decade and that this Government are doing things which the last Labour Government did not do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Franks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to the 1974–79 Labour Government. Can he recall the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Tony Crosland, coming to speak at a dinner in Manchester city hall in 1979 and using the words, addressed specifically to local government, "The party is over."?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Enough of those recollections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hunt. The relevance of my experience is in relation to ordinary council officers. The speech of the Labour spokesman today showed that the Opposition do not understand the difference between council officers and council members. They do not understand that there is a big dividing line. On the Greater London council sat people who did not have the relevant experience and qualifications for the job and who had never held a position of high authority anywhere. They were promoted to very highly paid positions with much authority simply because they were Labour placemen and women. Secretaries were appointed to the board of London
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
Transport. An assistant director-general was appointed whose only relevant experience was that he was the Labour candidate for Henley at the previous general election, in which he did not do very well. Everybody knows that it was going on at the GLC, and that people without relevant experience were appointed to high salaried positions.<br><br>
The remarks of the hon. Member for Normanton are not surprising. It is not surprising that he wants high salaries for advisers, because the Labour party and its structure relies on that type of corruption. It relies upon paying high salaries to Labour placemen and making sure that the party has its own professional army of people to carry out its policy.<br><br>
Clause 9 is an act of generosity, as my right hon. Friend the Minister said. It is a recognition that, in an increasingly complicated world, it is important to have proper advice for councillors.<br><br>
On Tuesday, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Would my hon. Friend"—</p></blockquote>
the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley)—
<br><blockquote><p>"confirm that the minority report, which was produced by people with experience of and who knew something about local government, suggested that"—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 7 March 1989, c.217.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have had enough about the Widdicombe report this morning. There will be other opportunities to raise those matters. Unless the hon. Gentleman can relate what he is saying directly to the amendment before the Committee, I cannot allow him to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that report relates to the amendment. It is important that those of us who have heard so much about it should know when we will get a copy of it. Three Labour Members—the hon. Members for Hammersmith, for Brightside and, now, for Normanton—tell us that a minority report exists and that it relates to the amendment under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a minute. I do not know whether it does or does not. I have not read it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is seeking to intervene. That demonstrates the danger of dealing with matters of this sort in the context of this debate. We are about to extend the debate much wider than the amendment. I shall of course allow the hon. Member for Brightside to intervene, but I hope that that will not lead to a general discussion about the Widdicombe report, which would be wholly out of order in the context of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Member for Brightside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall supply to Conservative Members the reference to the note of dissent from Sir

Lawrence Boyle. I refer them to chapter seven of "Democracy in Crisis", the authors of which were Keith Jackson and myself. [Hon. Members: "Oh!"]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention is most helpful. We look forward to receiving that book. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will append with it the minority report which he has been going on about for so long. Very little that is serious has been said in the very long speech of the hon. Member for Normanton. We understand the Labour party's position, which he is seeking to protect—it is not an honourable one. The Labour party's recent history is not honourable. The hon. Gentleman should be ashamed of himself for putting forward amendments of this sort. I support the clause and reject the amendments, but the hon. Member for Truro raised some serious points which we must consider. However, if we are to take seriously what is said on this and other clauses, the Opposition must be honest about what was said in the Widdicombe report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall reply to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr Taylor). I am sorry that he finds the divisions about the terms of office confusing. There is a problem because some councils retire a third, a third and a third, and some have a complete election. The rules are clear, I think, but I shall look at them again to see whether anything needs clarification. When the council is elected as a whole, the term of office must end at the first annual meeting of the new council. When the council is elected by thirds, the term of office must end at the annual meeting when the successors of the Councillors who are elected in the year in which the assistant is appointed come into office.<br><br>
There is another exception. Because the Scottish legislation does not use the concept of an annual meeting, a different approach is needed for Scotland. That is the reason for putting the provision in that way. I am sorry about that, but it is a tribute to the variety of local government, and I am one of those who would like there to be more variety, not less.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about highly-paid financial advisers. There is a problem here. I believe that the sort of financial advice that is under discussion ought to be available to members of the council from officers. Let us suppose that the minority group wanted different financial arrangements for the cost of, or charges for, certain services, or to increase the rates in a different way or to take more money out of balances. Most local authorities in Britain, would expect their officers to provide that technical advice for them. That is what being officers for the whole council means. I should not like alternative advice to have to be provided because the officers did not provide it.<br><br>
There is a difficulty here. We feel that the sort of salary level that is provided for is right. Obviously one can argue about it, and I see that the hon. Member wants to say a little more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying but when, for example budgets are being drawn up and parties are making different proposals, they need alternative advice. It may not be physically possible for the financial officers to give such advice to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
groups who have to negotiate rapidly about different offers. They need available specialist advice.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be more appropriate for advice to be given on a voluntary basis by those with a political interest. The ratepayer should not necessarily have to pay for such advice. It is a difficult problem and perfectly reasonable that we should disagree about the way to solve it. I draw my line a little to the side of the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has put it well. His examples may have satisfied the hon. Gentleman. Does my right hon. Friend agree that a political adviser could be the partner in a firm of chartered accountants or someone working in a bank who was prepared to offer his services for a number of hours to, for example, the SLD group on a council? That would not necessarily negate the salary that he was drawing from the chartered accountant partnership. It would still fall within the ambit of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. Our mind would not be closed if the hon. Member for Truro suggested a way in which we could help. I do not believe that there is an appropriate way to solve that limited problem. It is better to leave it to people who are willing to give advice tot the political party that they support.<br><br>
I am looking forward to the hon. Gentleman's amendments in respect of what will happen when there are three, four or five more parties. I know that that is close to his heart at the moment, in view of Mr. Meadowcroft's recent announcement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggested that people would voluntarily give financial advice. I remind him that he caused difficulties on Cornwall county council when he told Conservatives that the Liberals' rate proposal was too high and that it was our fault. The Conservatives' proposal was 3p higher, and they had to withdraw it. Amateur advice is not always helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in how the hon. Gentlemen is able to quote what I am supposed to have said at a private meeting, which is the only one that I have held in Cornwall. It has nothing to do with the amendment.<br><br>
I shall reply with care to the hon. Member for Normanton because I do not want to be misunderstood or misquoted. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman rested some of his case on his interpretation of the Widdicombe report. He did not make it clear that the minority report to which his hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside referred was his hon. Friend's own book dressed as an independent minority report to the Widdicombe committee. That is the closest anyone could get to misleading the Committee without it being improper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the clever filibustering in the Committee. I did not say that the note of dissent merely appeared in the book. I said that the reference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0579">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
to the note of dissent appeared in the book, which is very different. I shall make sure that the Minister receives a copy of that part of the chapter which refers to the note of dissent and its source.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pursue this matter too closely because you would stop me, Mr. Hunt. The phrases "minority report" and "note of dissent" were intended to suggest that it had an official status connected with the Widdicombe report. That has been proved not to be true. The reference turns out to be in a book written by the hon. Gentleman. That is not the way to inform a Committee. We have discovered an attitude that I hope the hon. Gentleman did not display too often in Sheffield. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment. The clause as drafted is more appropriate to the kind of special adviser that the Committee should support.</span></p>

and insert 'not less than five'.</p>
<p>Government amendment No. 69.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 9 should be amended to ensure that the apportionment of special advisers is absolutely fair. I am anxious that the special advisers serve the party political groups in a clear and public way and do not serve any other political group. That is the distinction between the special adviser, who is bound, in part, to be political, and the entirely non-political local government officer. We must decide how best to distribute the advisers.<br><br>
It would be wrong for a council with a large majority not to have a political adviser merely because there was no mechanism for a small opposition to have one. We could not say to a majority party, "You were so successful in the election that your opposition has less than 10 per cent. of the council membership, but you cannot have a political adviser because there is no arrangement for your opposition to have one". Equally, the members of the small minority party would have a heavy burden because they would have to sit on many committees. It would not be right that they should be denied a political adviser while the majority party—its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
members would have a lighter burden because there would be so many to spread around the committees—could have one.<br><br>
It should be clear in the Bill that if a local authority wants special advisers it can appoint one for the majority party, but if it does so it will have to provide one for the opposition. The opposition will be defined as the largest party of opposition. If there are two parties of significant size, a third person should be added.<br><br>
The Bill as drafted would mean that a special adviser could not be appointed to a very small opposition party. I agreed with various people from different parties that that was wrong. The amendment seeks to put it right.<br><br>
The other amendments in the group seek to expand and increase the number of people involved. I think that it is best to rely upon the kind of measurement that we propose. It is less than Widdicombe suggested but it seems reasonable. It suggests that in normal circumstances, where there are two sides to a council, each has a special adviser if the council wishes it. If one side is significantly divided between two significant groups, both of which have a minimum number of seats, two advisers could be provided for the opposition. Combining the two seems a reasonable balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if there are two opposition parties with reasonably large numbers of seats, the end result could be that a majority party, which had more councillors than the two other parties together, could have one adviser, but the opposition would have two? If so, does he consider that reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the suggestion, and the reason is simple. Although it is true that all local government officers are there to advise the whole council, as a matter of praticalities it is a fact that the man or woman who chairs the committee, and directs policy, is likely to have easier access to, and be more au fait with, what is happening, by being there. We felt that it would not disrupt unduly the balance of a council if we allowed the opposition to have a little more assistance. I have taken account of authorities around the country and I find that the proposal strikes the different political parties pretty evenly in the sense that Conservative-majority councils and Labour-majority councils will find themselves with opposition parties which have two special advisers.<br><br>
The only party that will gain particularly is whichever part of the Social and Liberal Democratic alliance happens to be the largest group on a council. In such circumstances, it is true that Liberals—using the old-fashioned term in the broad sense—will gain rather more than either of the two major parties. I do not find that too disconcerting. I will not say why, because the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), whom I found so charming earlier, might be disconcerted. I am sure that leaders of Conservative-majority councils would not find it unacceptable if the opposition had a slightly greater degree of support than the controlling Conservative group. That sort of help when in opposition is not without precedent.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0580">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the notion that the Minister has outlined. Let us imagine the position of a majority Labour council, with the SDL and the SLD having a reasonable number of councillors. The SLD and the SDL have one adviser each, and the Labour party has one. At a future date, the two decide to merge. They would have two advisers, and the Labour party one. Is that reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they became one party they would have only one adviser. The hon. Gentleman is now in cloud-cuckoo land. The idea of the two parties merging seems so far removed from reality that we need not take it as a possibility in the Bill. That is not a serious contribution. The hon. Gentleman is a man of great seriousness, and we have crossed swords, but he must not introduce such preposterous Peter Pan concepts. If ever the party without a leader joined the leader without a party, the nation would be very different. I do not see that happening within the lifespan of these proposals, which I suspect will last a long time. The hon. Gentleman must not tease the Liberals in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises an important issue when he talks of advisers to opposition parties. We have spoken of there being independent groups on district councils in rural areas. On some councils, the majority are independents. A group of Labour or Alliance and Democratic members might constitute a further group. Because no political group administers a council, would they deny the opposition groups an adviser if they wished for one? Perhaps the Minsiter can advise us on this matter, which could present a problem.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. Curiously, on most councils where independents sit, they exist as an independent group rather than as independents. Such a group could have an adviser if it was in control but only if it also provided advisers on these terms to the other opposition parties. Similarly, if the Labour party was in control, and the largest opposition party was the independent group, it could provide an adviser for that group. It would be up to it to do so. What the ruling party could not do would be to take an adviser for itself and not offer one to the independent group if it were the largest group in the opposition. If the independent group refused the adviser, so be it. The ruling party could continue to have its adviser because it would have provided the same opportunity for the independent group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the heading of the clause, "Assistance for political groups." How could a non-political group take advantage of the clause? There is no reference to anything other than political groups. The Minister said the other night that he was aware that there were people who campaigned as independents but were, in the main, Tories. If there is no provision in the Bill for independent groups, how will the clause apply to opposition parties so that they qualify for a political adviser?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word "political" embraces the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
independent group. In the district council where I live, there are two groups of independents which are allied in different ways, but they are clearly political groups. They are run like political groups, although they might not be party political in the sense of being Labour or Conservative.<br><br>
The legal position is that the clause would apply to independents who were a group. A group of independents would be able to apply. I give the hon. Gentleman an analogy that he will recognise. Although the Baptists were a non-connectional body, they had an organisation called the Baptist Union, which enabled them to participate in national discussions even though their basic system of church government was independent. It was a sort of compromise that has to operate in a system. That is what most independent groups do. In these circumstances, they would meet the requirements that the clause makes possible.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will support the Government amendment, which would protect the position of small opposition groups, and resist the other amendments, which would extend the scope and number of advisers beyond what is reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister, not with political interest. I am concerned that the amendments do not cover the range of circumstances that can occur in councils and that they can either be abused or simply fail to work appropriately in some situations. I shall speculate on a few of the circumstances, some of which the Minister may intend to cover in other ways in the Bill, although I am not sure that he will succeed.<br><br>
It is not inconceivable that the party that commands the larger group and decides whether to allocate an adviser to another group will allocate an adviser to its coalition partner on the council. Contrary to what the Labour party says, the parties running a council might carve up the available advice between them so that none was available to parties attempting to oppose the majority.<br><br>
There is nothing in the Bill to stop both political advisers going to the majority party. As the majority on a council will have the power to allocate the adviser, it might make such a decision. The allocation might not be moral but it would be human and I can envisage it.<br><br>
Similarly, a Labour party for example, might command an overwhelming majority on a council that had two small opposition groups. It is not clear whether the group with the overwhelming majority would make what the Minister or I felt was the appropriate allocation of the special adviser. Lord knows what it would decide, but both of us might have reason to be dissatisfied.<br><br>
It is important that the opposition voices, few though they may be, can make their case as well as possible, otherwise, the problem of a one-party state arises. The council will operate within one party's terms. What few opposition councillors there are will be out on a limb, unable to generate the expertise and presence necessary to do their job effectively. They may be spread around to an almost impossible extent, trying to serve on many different committees.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0581">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
To ensure that different views in the area are properly represented it is important that opposition voices are well serviced. The suggestion that only one of the two groups, which may have the same number of councillors, can receive advice is of doubtful validity. Even if the Minister feels that the two opposition groups should not get one special adviser each because they are so small, he should reconsider the provision to ensure that the people in the borough have effective representation on all the council's committees.<br><br>
Another possibility, which could easily occur in my part of the world and in many other rural areas, is that the independent councillors do not act together and are defined as a group under the Bill. The largest group in the council might be the Labour party, whose people all run with the party flag behind them. If the Labour party had six or seven councillors but the Liberal and Conservative representation was small, at four councillors each, the opposition groups would be excluded from receiving advice. It is not difficult to see how the advice could go to the party that on most occasions had least influence on the direction of the council.<br><br>
The most significant scenario would arise where the Labour party, or possibly the Conservative party, had an overwhelming majority on a council. From our debate today, it appears that the problem would be more likely to occur with the Labour party. If the Labour party had an overwhelming majority on a council, I cannot see what would stop it dividing its group to make use of the extra special adviser.<br><br>
I have read further in the Bill and I see that the Minister hopes to introduce regulations to define what constitutes a political group to avoid the problem, but my concern is that they will be almost impossible to enforce. It might be said that a group that meets in the same room constitutes one group, but that would not be difficult to overcome. It might be said that a political group is one that runs on one manifesto, but in many local authority areas a manifesto is only an outline, and it would not be difficult to run on individual platforms in different wards, if that seemed a way of increasing the amount of special advice.<br><br>
It is possible for a party whose control of a council is so secure that it can risk division within its numbers to get round any definition of a political group. What happens with groups that have split up, wether in Manchester or anywhere else? If they run on the same manifesto as before, but no longer act as one party, do they count as one party?<br><br>
These circumstances may arise naturally, but they may be used as a deliberate way of getting round an attempt to ensure that genuinely different political viewpoints are properly represented. The fundamental problem in the Government Amendments is that a simple majority on the council is open to abuse—something that is avoided elsewhere in the regulations.<br><br>
My amendments are in two groups with two aims.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
Amendments Nos. 112, 113 and 114 aim to restore the Widdicombe proposals. Amendments Nos. 109, 110 and 111 aim to reduce the breaking point at which groups are entitled to special advice. The influence and importance of a group are not necessarily apparent from the number of seats that it holds. In many councils, a group that holds 10, 15 or even 20 per cent. of the seats has no effective influence over the policies that the council pursues. It may be the third party and carved out so that it has no real say in those policies. I believe that such groups should have special advisers, but it can be argued that they do not need them. In some councils, a handful of councillors hold the balance of power—at times working in coalition with another party; at other times shifting the balance of power within the council by circulating chairmanship and taking each vote on its own merits. An example of that can be seen in Humberside, where there are 35 Labour councillors, 36 Tory councillors and four Social and Liberal Democrats. Clearly, those four Social and Liberal Democrats have an important role, and if the role of special advisers is to ensure that decisions taken are the best possible decisions and based on the best possible information, those four councillors need advice just as much as do the Labour and Tory councillors.<br><br>
We are talking about proper government in terms of advice and decisions, so the rules governing the advice should be sufficiently flexible to take account of the special circumstances that can arise in councils.<br><br>
Smaller groups often face difficulties that are more considerable than those facing larger groups. Those groups are spread more thinly and often cannot sit on all the council committees.<br><br>
I should like to put a question to the Minister about the five groups: how in Grampian, which has 17 Labour councillors, 15 Conservatives, 12 Social and Liberal Democrats and 8 SNP councillors can any one group be carved out and prevented from getting special advice? There are smaller groups, too. The four main groups have a significant role, and Grampian is an example of a place where the Widdicombe proposals were right and the Minister's proposals were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Gentleman's concerns, some of which can properly and adequately be dealt with in the regulations. For example, in defining political grouping, to avoid misunderstanding, it will be important to deal with the issue of independence that was raised by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). It is important to make that clear.<br><br>
It will be important also to point out that the definition of political groups will have something to do—</span></p>
