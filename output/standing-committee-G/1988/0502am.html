	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition believe that clause 137 will weaken the security, and increase the rents, of tenants whose long-term tenancies, including leases, has expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already widespread and long-established anxiety about the problems of long lease holders. There are 1.5 million leaseholders in Britain whose properties will revert to the freeholders when their lease expires. That might not be a problem in the early years, but, as leases mature, they depreciate in value and become much more difficult to sell. In those circumstances, leaseholders often find that they are unable to buy other accommodation, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1202</span>
freeholders are often disinclined to invest in maintenance and improvements when a lease approaches its expiry date. On expiry, a leaseholder can claim his rights as a tenant under the Rent act 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems related to leases nearing expiry are likely to become more widespread when the many flats that were built during the post-war years, and sold on 99-year leases, become affected. This is a problem in London, of course, but we have also experienced it for many years in the Principality. Many organisations, including the Building Societies Association and the National Consumer Council, have argued that no more leasehold tenancies should be created and that leaseholders should be given the right to own the freehold of their property. The Leasehold Reform Act 1967 gave this right to the leaseholders of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the considerable problems that are experienced by long leaseholders, it is wrong to undermine their rights further through clause 137. This argument is strengthened by the fact that the owners of leases that are about to expire are likely to be old people on low incomes who are vulnerable to pressures from unscrupulous freeholders. They face the danger of abuse and harassment by freeholders, as leasehold property is often sold because of its investment value to companies which have little interest in maintaining and managing property and want only to sell it with vacant possession at the earliest opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 686 would prevent the provision in clause 137 from operating retrospectively. Existing leaseholders have taken on leases on the understanding that they will be converted into Rent Act protected tenancies on expiry. The Housing Act 1988 protected the rights and security of existing tenants, and the principle should apply to leaseholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 688 would alter the date from which the clause would catch existing leaseholders from 1999 to 15 January 2019.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that the hon. Member for Kensington (Mr. Fishburn) is putting forward a private Member's Bill which suggests a radical change in leasehold arrangements. It is time we had a major review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) made several arguments that show clearly that leasehold practices, especially towards the end of a lease, are far from satisfactory. As my hon. Friend said, they often affect the elderly. People who take on a 30-year lease and remain in the property for that time face becoming tenants and might pay more in rent than they paid in the early stages of buying the lease. There must be something wrong with a system that detracts from the advantageous position that they held previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a more radical approach. There is a case for the commonhold principle that is practised in several countries. I would need to look at that in more detail, but it seems that the protections available to a leaseholder towards the end of a lease are far from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1203</span>
adequate, and we should take the opportunity to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is prepared to accept the amendments, or even to go further, we will consider his suggestions in a spirit of co-operation. There is a case for changing the leasehold procedure, which does not work to the benefit of someone who has stayed in a house for a long time and who faces the lease being withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many examples of this problem in my constituency, and I am sure that you, Mr. Hunt, must encounter it. Any areas with a lot of leasehold property will suffer from it. It is perhaps increasing because of the large number of people who brought their leases just before or just after the second world war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the other day, I dealt with a case where the freeholder refused to sell for less than £150,000. Even freehold, the house is probably not worth much more. It is absurd that someone who has lived in it for many years should be asked to pay such a high sum for the lease. We should take a rather more radical look at the arrangements to see whether we can change them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may well need to take a more radical look at leaseholds, and I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Mr. Fishburn) is seeking to get the Government to do exactly that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some difficulty responding to the amendments. In the light of the debate, I might be prepared to consider the amendments to schedule 9. This group of amendments deals with the change from fair rents to market rents, which was the most important part of the Housing Act 1988, so I might have difficulty meeting in the concerns of the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would defer in different ways the application of schedule 9. Clause 137 and schedule 9 would establish a new regime for long leaseholders whose leases come to an end. At present, under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, most such leaseholders are entitled to remain in occupation as Rent Act tenants with the right to a fair rent. The new provisions will enable them to convert to assured tenancies under the Housing Act 1988 at market rents. The change from fair rents to market rents is an entirely logical adjunct to the measures to deregulate private sector lettings, which we introduced in the 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for deregulation was, as I am sure the hon. Member for Torfaen accepts, exhaustively debated when what became the 1988 Act was before Parliament, and we do not need to go over that ground today. Now that we have established the market rent principle for the generality of lettings, it would hardly be right to perpetuate the fair rent regime for long leases that are coming to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made our intentions on that subject clear as long ago as October 1987, as part of the main deregulation package. We had hoped to include the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1204</span>
necessary provisions in the 1988 Act, but the drafting was more difficult than we had expected. The measures were therefore deferred for inclusion in this Bill. We always accepted the necessity for a long transitional period before full operation of the new regime. We were especially conscious of the need to avoid penalising those who, when the proposals were announced, had recently bought a lease with only a few years to run in the expectation of converting it to a Rent Act tenancy at its termination. To that end, we provided that, whereas the new system will apply to all leases granted after commencement of clause 137, it will apply to existing leases only when they come to an end on or after 15 January 1999—in other words, a full 10 years after the new assured tenancy regime comes into effect. In our view, that provides a perfectly adequate period in which existing leaseholders can adjust to the new approach that we are adopting. We therefore see no reason for the further delays that the amendments would involve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister accepts that the problem of leaseholding is clearly a matter of grave concern to everyone involved in housing, and on the understanding that he will talk to the Building Societies Association and local government associations on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 689, in page 160, line 24, leave out from "tenancy" to end of line 29 and insert—
	<br><q><p>"The expression 'the premises qualifying for protection', in relation to a long residential tenancy, means the aggregate of the premises of which, if the tenancy had not been at a low rent the tenant would be entitled by virtue of the 1988 Act to retain possession on the coming to an end of the tenancy at the term date.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 697, in page 162, leave out lines 36 to 43.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, it is not appropriate to go through all the debates that we had on what became the Housing Act 1988. We registered our view at that time—that we felt that power was being shifted from the tenant to the landlord. There was a crucial change from discretionary to mandatory powers of repossession, under which the landlord had the right to take back the property. In these amendments and the next group, we ask the Minister to tighten schedule 2 of the 1988 Act, because it puts tenants at a serious disadvantage. I accept that the Bill is not a consolidation measure, but it could tighten parts of the 1988 Act without going over the whole debate. We accept that schedule 2 is now law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present wording of clause 137 and schedule 9 means that, in respect of long leases that will end on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1205</span>
or after 15 January 1999 and long leases granted after the Bill becomes law, a leaseholder will not be entitled to an assured tenancy after the lease ends if any part of his home has been sublet when the lease expires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to remove that provision. Under it, any leaseholder who lets part of his home when the lease ends will lose that part to the landlord, and that would happen even if subletting had been agreed or allowed by the lease, or done with the landlord's consent, or even if the letting was only short-term. The provisions undermine the leaseholder's rights and discourage the leaseholder whose lease is coming to an end from letting rooms. The result is less housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that that was the intention of schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the amendment reiterates the existing position—that leaseholders can sublet and retain the parts of their homes that are sublet as long as the subletting is temporary. Unamended, the Bill will close that option. I hope that the Minister will open it again by accepting the amendment and returning to the existing arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) moved the amendment. During the passage or what became the 1988 Act, he was in the vanguard of the Opposition and I can give him comfort in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not satisfied with the wording of this part of the clause and the schedule. We intend to delete paragraph 3(3), and amendment No. 689 is close to our thinking. The hon. Gentleman will be pleasantly surprised when we return to the matter. However, I must ensure that amendments Nos. 689 and 697 to paragraph 5(5) are technically correct. I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman a solemn undertaking that we shall return to the matter and meet his anxieties head on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Minister's response. I am tempted to ask him what the technical difference is and whether this is the only occasion on which our amendment will be accepted, giving us a slight victory.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can continue in the same vein.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is obviously a very good day and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has set a good standard. Perhaps it is the right time to ask the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley) not to send in her bulldozers on the Victorian building in Horsham that she intends to devastate. The Government are even wiping out the churches now. I wonder whether we can stop that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to education. Having been a mature student for many years, I have a great interest in grants and awards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education support grant funding is currently limited to 1 per cent. of the expenditure for education on which calculations for rate support grant are based. Clause 139 would repeal section 2 of the Education (Grants and Awards) Act 1984 so that the Secretary of State for Education and Science would have absolute scope to determine the level of education support grant funding. Therefore, in theory, the Secretary of State could choose to divert all education funding to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1208</span>
ESG funding. I recognise that that might be unlikely, but he would have that power. That should not be permissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would limit the Secretary of State's freedom and thus ensure that education support grant funding remains properly controlled by statute. The scope of such freedom for the Secretary of State is a disturbing prospect. Education support grant, more than any other specific grant in education, is clearly a deduction from the general total of grant-supported expenditure and therefore can in no sense be described as new money for education. Increases in the Secretary of State's spending power mean decreases in the discretion which authorities have in their main programme of expenditure for education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason, over the years local authorities have considered it important to restrict the amount of expenditure on services which the Secretary of State can directly control in this way. The Department of Education and Science has already indicated that the Secretary of State has no plans for a massive increase in education support grant. However, the point of principle in the limitation remains extremely important. I saw the Minister shaking her head at her advisers. I am not sure whether by that she means to concede on this matter too. If so, and she wishes to intervene, I shall allow her to. But it does not look as though she wishes to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purposes of the education support grant are to assist innovation, stimulate good practice and reflect national priorities—but under this Government that would mean the Secretary of State's priorities, which I would not always share. The present Secretary of State has chosen to direct much of the funding to activities associated with the implementation of the Education Reform Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a recent meeting with local authority associations, the Secretary of State said that the education support grant had never been intended to replace main programme funding but rather to have a catalytic effect on innovation. For 1989–90, the total has been set at £125 million which, I emphasise, is just under £10 million lower than the allowable maximum. For 1990–91, the Secretary of State has offered a ceiling of £140 million; the provisional allocations for 1990–91 are available for those who wish to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Secretary of State does not need the scope provided by clause 139 to allow him to increase educational support grant funding to 100 per cent. of the funding for education. Therefore, there is no logical justification for the Government not to accept either of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment will retain the 1 per cent. calculation set by the Education (Grants and Awards) Act 1984 by determining that the figure should be
	<br><q><p>"reasonably comparable with the 1 per cent."</p></q>
figure in that Act. However, it seeks to allow for inflation by adding that due allowance shall be made in the calculation for price variation as measured by the retail price index.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to accept amendment No. 846, the second alternative,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1209</span>
amendment No. 845, provides the Secretary of State with the power to determine the level of educational support grant funding but builds in a statutory responsibility to consult the local authority associations before doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is more than a minor degree of concern about the educational priorities adopted by the Government and, indeed, about the amount of funding put into education in this country compared with others. Needless to say, there is anxiety about the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the amendments should be accepted. There is nothing wrong with them in principle and they follow the Government's guidelines. The Minister should indicate his acceptance of them, even if he wishes to alter their wording slightly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) being suspicious about the Government's intentions, when spending per pupil has risen so dramatically in the Government's lifetime. It is extraordinary of the hon. Gentleman to treat these proposals with suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change, and the amendments that the hon. Gentleman seeks to introduce, are the effects of moving away from the present rate support grant system. The education support grant is fixed in relation to the relevant expenditure for the rate support grant figures. Initially it was 0.5 per cent., and it then moved to the 1 per cent. ceiling in 1986. Originally, it was used for such matters as midday supervision, or the introduction of the general certificate of secondary education—although those aspects have now dropped out of the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, the ESG has been used for local management of schools, core subjects in the national curriculum, governor training, local education authority inspectors, English in the curriculum, action to combat drug misuse, and adult literacy. That has proved to be a small but useful way of influencing the way in which local authorities spend their money and order their priorities. But it would be quite wrong to see the money out of proportion. For this year, total ESG expenditure is a mere £125.5 million out of total expenditure on education amounting to £14 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith seeks to introduce a further limit. We shall not support the hon. Gentleman's amendments because they would introduce yet another round of consultation. The Secretary of State is already required by statute to consult on the content of this programme and he has made it abundantly clear that there is no intention to alter the proportion being spent on ESG at present. An artificial limit would be introduced by the amendments, which is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To get the matter in proportion, the hon. Member for Hammersmith should know that the local education authority training grant scheme this year amounted to £230 million—nearly twice as much as the ESG—and has no statutory ceiling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a technical matter which arises from the changes in the way in which local government is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1210</span>
financed. The amendments suggested by the hon. Member for Hammersmith are unnecessary, and I confirm that the Secretary of State for Education and Science has given a firm commitment to consult—he must by statute—on these proposals. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not particularly enamoured of that reply. It will not do for the Government to claim that they spend more per head per pupil than before. We all know that by comparison with other European powers we spend far less, which is how comparisons should be made. All that we measure on a year by year basis is the speed of decline, not the speed of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are missing an opportunity to reassure, not least if they accepted our point about consultation. The consultation the Minister suggests raises the following question: if the results of that consultation are not accepted, what will happen? The growing conviction in the country is that the Government, at best, consult briefly and premptorily shortly before a decision is made, and that the consultation has little effect on the outcome.

Whether with doctors in the National Health Service or about the Housing Act 1988, which was launched in print only a matter of weeks after the Government had announced their willingness to discuss certain aspects of the legislation, the Government's discussions were worth nothing.

The Government are not taking the measure seriously. They should make more effort. I do not want to put the amendment to a vote at this stage, but we may return to it on Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that new clause 17 moves some way towards new clauses 28 and 29, but I am not 100 per cent. sure that the Minister has met all our points. If the Minister will explain new clause 17 to the Committee, that will be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to hear that. My principle point is that this is an uncontentious clause. Many Committee Members will be aware that three mobility schemes are in operation. The national mobility scheme and the London area mobility scheme receive direct Exchequer support under section 107 of the Housing Act 1985, and the housing association liaison project receives indirect support via the housing corporation under section 87 of the Housing Associations Act 1985. Unfortunately, the existing powers are limited to schemes which relate to moves by secure tenants who are principally local authority or existing housing association tenants. In practice, a number of moves have involved non-secure tenants, such as non-tenants on waiting lists and homeless households, for whom there has been an absence of proper statutory backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17 extends the scheme to these movers and to assured tenants. Therefore, in part, this is a consequential amendment arising from the introduction of new-style assured tenancies in the Housing Act 1988. Section 107 is cast in narrower terms, but the terms of new clause 17 are deliberately broad to cater for a wide range of possibilities. That
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1212</span>
does not mean that the Government would be prepared to fund any arrangement which would more appropriately be a self-supporting commercial operation in the private sector. The new provision will merely be an enabling power which would not prescribe the type or extent of funding. Approval of funding would rest with the Secretary of State, precisely as if does now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may recall that, during the Committee stage of what became the Housing Act 1988, the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) moved an amendment to allow for mobility changes so that:
	<br><q><p>"tenants in all circumstances will have the opportunity of the widest possible housing alternatives, wherever they live and wherever they wish to go."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 15 March 1988; c.1641–2.]</p></q>
Possible changes to current mobility schemes are under consideration by a mobility working party, and the new clause that I moved should allow for funding for any mobility scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. It is clear from what the Minister said that the Government's aim is to ensure that any new mobility scheme will be funded as he describes. That helps a great deal, because we were anxious about this aspect. I might add that new clause 28 also expresses our anxiety about consultations, which are an important part of the procedure. If local authorities devised other schemes and wanted to consider necessary movement and the financing for it, it would be helpful to have it on record that the Government are prepared to consult and discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can spell out a little of our thinking. It is obviously necessary, as my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said during the Committee stage of the Housing Bill 1988, to allow tenants to move for their own needs, but there is also an important economic aspect. I should like to see the mobility scheme opened up widely to make it easier for people to move around the country. A unique aspect of Britain is that, largely because we put so few resources into rented property, the mobility of labour is restricted. It is extremely difficult for a person to leave one job and go to another in a different part of the country because of the problems of finding accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot be the only hon. Member who has had this experience. A typical problem for a London Member of Parliament is to have an acute housing crisis in his constituency and to know that people could move to the north of England and find housing, but could not possibly find work. The reverse applies to people who move from some regions to areas of higher employment. This is a genuine problem but, eventually, with the coming of regional government, we envisage it being easier for people in the rented sector to move to other areas and find work. I do not think that the Government have yet bitten on that bullet, but I accept that new clause 17 moves in the right direction, and I support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Let us go over it again slowly.

We have no wish to pre-empt the discussions that are taking place with local authority associations. I attended a recent meeting on this subject. We have no wish to pre-empt the work of the working party on mobility which is meeting currently. The relevant part of the new clause is so drawn as not to do so. That should reassure the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 15 relates to anomalies in legislation. Certain cut-off dates deprive people living in defective housing from obtaining assistance for houses that are included in the list. Many houses are defective and were built at the same time as houses that the Minister has included in the list of designated types of defective houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other categories of housing ought to be included. We ask the Minister to consider giving assistance with non-traditional houses which have construction defects to people who, under the Government's scheme, purchased such houses on the understanding that they were sound and would give them a home for a good number of years. Now, shortly after purchase a number of these houses are in such a condition that if help is not given to their owner-occupiers, they will find themselves in serious difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to houses owned by local authorities and other public bodies. If something is not done to help put right the construction defects in these houses, people will in the near future, be living in substandard housing that will be classed as slums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admitted in a letter to us dated 4 April that the £15 million reserve that was set aside under the housing investment programme allocation for 1989–90 had been distributed to local authorities which had "a serious problem" with housing defects. He has acknowledged that there is a problem and stated that something should be done. But when? We must consider seriously the position of local authorities and owner-occupiers and amend the Bill to give it a worthwhile purpose—helping these people and the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report published in 1986 by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, which carried out a survey of housing defects, states:
	<br><q><p>"The English House Condition Survey showed, in 1981, that 24 per cent. of the housing stock (4,332,000 dwellings) were seriously defective. The total number of privately owned substandard dwellings with an estimated repair bill of more than £2,500 at 1981 prices (£3,200 at 1986/87 prices) was 3,311,000. The total cost of bringing the private sector up to standard"</p></q>

at that time; a substantial number of houses have come into the pivate sector since then—
	<br><q><p>"is £27 billion."</p></q>
In Wakefield, thousands of houses are defective. Some come under the authority's approved prescribed list, but many more do not. The Minister must give us an idea of what the Government intend to do about the non-traditional type houses and the problems that go with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cut-off dates in the 1985 Act leave a large number of people on the wrong side of them. A constituent of mine applied to purchase his house before the cut-off date came into being, and the contract was signed afterwards, but he does not qualify for grant because of the way in which the date is applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other constituents were tenants of National Coal Board houses. They applied to buy in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Because the transaction with the board took years to conclude, they lost out on grant that might otherwise have been available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now proposed to demolish the estate in Oulton in the Leeds city area because no assistance was given when it was designated defective. A great many people, both tenants and owner-occupiers, should be helped because their houses have become defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents is a widow in her 80s who has occupied her own home in a mining area for a considerable time. She moved into smaller accommodation offered by the local authority, but her original home cannot be sold because of structural defects. British Coal say that as it is not responsible for mining operations after a certain date it is not responsible for the defects. I do not accept the argument and that dear old lady is not entitled to any assistance because of the limits on HIP and the allocation for structural improvements. A substantial number of people face the same problem. The case of Mrs. Kelly is mirrored millions of times throughout the country because there is no genuine effort to improve defective housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the case of the Smith houses in Sandwell. Twelve houses built on top of a derelict mine were sold to tenants by Sandwell council. Afterwards cracks started appearing in the houses as the main shaft sank. As with Mrs. Kelly, the damage was caused by mining subsidence. The owners cannot sell because no one will offer a mortgage until the houses are repaired, but the council cannot do the work because it will be radical and expensive. The only answer is for the Government to make extra funds available. A grant of £667,000 from the Department of the Environment to Sandwell council for defective housing would be the norm. The extra grant required for such repairs to substantial, so the issue must be given serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier sitting I referred to the problems facing people in Peterlee. The residents are tenants and owner-occupiers of non-traditional housing. A substantial number of presentations for help have been made, but as yet no satisfaction has been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1216</span>
obtained. Will the Minister consider carefully the problems facing people in Peterlee and elsewhere? When the Housing Bill was discussed in the House of Lords on 11 October 1988 Lord Dormand referred at column 831 to the issue and to the cut-off dates that apply under the 1985 Act. Many people, not only owner-occupiers but tenants, are worried.

There is a different problem in Rochdale, near the Minister's home. On the external walls of older dwellings cavity wall ties have failed and there is buttressing of the gable ends and other walls. Unless people are helped there will be greater defects and they will lose their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newer properties were built under a scheme suggested by the Government of the day. There was pressure to build non-traditional houses speedily, but now they do not work. They are not acceptable and there is a massive programme of defective housing to be tackled. I ask the Minister to give the issues careful consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past we have heard a great deal about inner-city developments and regeneration. Many such homes are built in inner-city areas. If the Government want to arrest the problem they must make more resources available so that the defects can be made good and the houses brought to a proper standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider the new clause and the cut-off dates after which people cannot be given assistance. Other categories of properties not in the current list should be included. The Government should set a course of action to tackle defective housing. The new clause is not a wrecking device. It is a constructive proposal to help millions of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said, the 1985 Act recognised the problem, but in listing the six types of property it underestimated the scale of the problem of defective building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time it was suggested in the building trade that we move away from traditional brick buildings and materials towards system build. During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s local authorities were often given tied aid to build these properties. We all remember the house constructed at the Brighton exhibition of 1965 in so many man hours. It was the instant house, which could be knocked together quickly. Local authorities were told that if they opted for those types of homes they would receive an enhanced HIP. Those homes are now defective and there is a backlog to be repaired. The problem was acknowledged by the 1985 Act, but the Government have not addressed its scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I received a letter from the department of housing in my city, where there is a backlog of 17,500 defective system-type buildings, both privately and publicly owned. In reply to my question about the Heights estate of Airey housing, of which we have a substantial concentration, the letter said:
	<br><q><p>"The information I gave to you regarding programmed work commencing approximately in the year 2002 is based upon the rate of investment available to the Council, as allocated within our housing investment programme and bearing in mind that we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1217</span>
have other defective housing programmes to contend with than the Airey house remedial issue."</p></q>
In other words, it will be a long time before the housing can be seen to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with Airey housing is not that it needs to be knocked down. The building of a brick shell to support the roof and to reconstitute the basic structure is recognised by the Building Research Establishment as a method of improving the houses. The problem is one of scale: doing one after the other. As the 1988 Act suggested, grants were paid to buyers, but that is not enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give another practical example. The development officer of Leeds city council tells us that Airey houses are not the worst, and he is right. Spooner system houses have defective ties at their gable ends, which means that the end walls fall away. Obviously, that is much more dangerous. People who own or rent such houses have to warn their neighbours not to walk round the side because of the danger of the walls falling on top of them. That is a serious problem, and it should be dealt with by tackling the backlog of defective housing. It cannot be viewed as a burden on one income or one mortgage payer—even one local authority. An improvement programme that has Government funding is needed if we are to tackle that backlog of defective housing, both public and private. There is no other way. Unless action is taken, the people who live and are trapped in them cannot know whether they are safe. I concede, that there are various degrees of safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has become something of an expert on this subject, and I respect him for it. He and I know the difficulty of talking in these terms, especially in public—and, to all intents and purposes, this Committee is in public. In talking about the difference between Smith homes that are designated—the hon. Gentleman knows that they are—and British Iron and Steel Federation homes that are not designaed, we must be careful—Members of Parliament on both sides of the House have fallen into this trap—not to blight the property, particularly BISF homes. Some of us are going to considerable lengths to assure building societies and clearing banks that they need not be as concerned about houses that have not been so designated by the Building Research Establishment as they are about Smith houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that helpful intervention, which brings me to my next point. He says that he is anxious to assure building societies. That is precisely the point, because even houses that are referred to the Building Research Establishment for investigation and possible inclusion on the list of designated houses are now being blighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give another practical example. It may sound surprising, but in spite of the pressure to buy council houses, and the fact that some people were advised—even in the case of Airey houses that had been designated—that it would be unwise to exercise their right to buy because their home was of a type that was on the list, some people still went ahead with the purchase. I accept that they were exercising
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1218</span>
their right, but most of us accept that the real problem that then arises is mobility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, people these days do not live in the same house for all their lives. Often they move to a large house, if they want to have a family, and when the family has grown up, they move to a smaller house, and they may change areas. The difficulty arises at the point of exchange. If the building society says that it will not give the new purchaser a mortgage or—this is worse—if the building society cannot find anyone to insure the property, that property is blighted. People are trapped in their homes and cannot move out of them, no matter how much they want to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it would be wrong to suggest that every kind of house is defective. As I have already pointed out, there is a range of defects, some of which are dangerous and others less dangerous. Nevertheless, we must break the log jam—this may sound strange, coming from an Opposition Member—whereby people cannot sell their home because the purchaser cannot obtain a mortgage. Such people live in a house that is defective through no fault of theirs. In some cases, the defects did come to light in the surveyor's inspection and science was not sufficiently advanced at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must get to grips with the problem of helping purchasers as well as reducing the backlog of those in the public sector. The amendments do not address the overall problem, and do not ask for a special Bill to deal with it. They simply make it possible to do something now about people who get trapped by the time limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause, which I have broadened slightly by suggesting that now is the time to tackle the backlog of defective housing in Britain. I accept that it is the result of the system builds that happened generations back, but unless we do something about it, thousands of people will be trapped in houses in which they feel unsafe and which they cannot sell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the hon. Gentleman's remarks carefully, up to the point at which he said that the time limit would make a dramatic difference. He seems to know what I am talking about, and my experience has been considerable over the past 18 months, as has his. What difference would the time limit make to designated and undesignated houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, there is a cut-off time for applying for grants. It means that once people move out of the time limit, they get no assistance. The Minister, then, cannot hope that the problem will go away by drifting along in time; we must tackle the problem now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give the example of some tenants that I met in Kidsgrove recently? They did not know the condition of their property when they purchased it. Later surveys identified the problem, but because of the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1219</span>
cut-off date, they were and are denied any assistance, although the district council and, I am sure, the Department of the Environment want to help. The new clause would afford assistance to people who otherwise are left high and dry and who, through no fault of their own, face desperate personal and financial problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A snapshot was taken in 1985 when the six types were listed, but that drastically underestimates the scale of the problem. I stress that the problem will not go away. Somehow we have to get to grips with the listing of types. We should nudge, if not push, the Building Research Establishment to publish its conclusions soon, so that decisions can be made about whether systems are defective. We need speedy decisions about whether buildings can properly be supported or need to be demolished. All that can be done much more effectively than what is being done now. People are being pushed into limbo. They seek through their own efforts to be included in the housing investment programme. It is so under-resourced that there is no chance of their house being tackled before the year 2002. They may have to negotiate personally with the mortgage company or building society that is in touch with the person hoping to buy their home. We have to get to grips with the problem, and I hope that the Minister can give us some positive encouragement this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not repeat what my hon. Friends said, because they outlined the situation with great clarity and expertise, but I take the Minister's point about discussion of individual details causing blight in some instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about a change in the law that will help tens of thousands of people. The problem is just as acute in Wales as it is in England. We have various examples of houses, such as the Dorlonco houses, which are not designated but which, individually, are in an awful condition, and which the people who bought them cannot sell. The Government make great play, both in Wales and the rest of the country, about the right-to-buy legislation. In those circumstances, the right-to-buy has created nightmares for many former tenants. I hope that the Minister can give us some assurance in his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was fascinating and interesting. I was heartened by what the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said. It is clear that he and his hon. Friends the Members for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) have some experience in this area. I find this extremely difficult. I have spoken to both Conservative and Socialist Members of Parliament, and no doubt the opportunity will arise to speak to Liberals on the subject. We walk a tightrope with homes that are not designated under the Building Research Establishment conditions. Therefore, Members of Parliament, invariably local authorities, which are usually Socialist—I accept that they perform a valuable and useful function—and I spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to persuade building societies and sometimes clearing banks that those homes should not be blighted. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1220</span>
hon. Member for Leeds, West specifically asked me to help in this respect. Indeed, my senior civil servants and I have spent much time talking to the Building Societies Association and individual building societies, especially in Nottingham where there are BISF houses, and my officials have been amazingly successful. They have worked extremely hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned building societies. Does he refer to individual local branches of building societies? Often the problem is not at national but at local level when people apply for mortgages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that and I am prepared to take it on the chin. One difficulty is that although a building society's headquarters may accept such advice, the message may not get through to local branch managers. I have encountered the difficulty in other respects with clearing banks, not necessarily in relation to property. Usually there is a way round the problem. A clear circular could go out from the building society's headquarters to make the change in policy abundantly clear to local managers. If the message is not made clear, we in central and local Government do a grave disservice to people who have occupied those buildings. In many instances, they knew the condition when they bought the property, but in some cases they did not. That is where the debate becomes confusing, especially to the bystander or the uninformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton said much with which I agree. He started by talking about the problems with housing defects in the round. As he will recall, he and I had a long debate under parts VII and VIII, about private-sector defects. As he later said, this part of the Bill specifically deals with the speedy improvements of non-traditional private-sector housing. The figures which the hon. Gentleman cited from the survey on English house conditions relate to housing stock generally and not to such non-traditional housing. I say that simply to put it on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing how the Bill will apply to housing and property defects in general. We are not trying to single out certain categories or to draw lines between who should and should not be considered. The Minister should be aware that we are taking a general view of the issue. The cutoff date affects many people who are involved in defective housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman explained it. There is a significant difference between us, as the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) understands. We simply cannot treat such so-called defective housing, to use the hon. Gentleman's term, in the round. For example, there is the difference whether such houses are registered as defective. I shall try to deal with the hon. Gentleman's points one by one as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept the point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, West that the research by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1221</span>
Building Research Establishment should be carried out as speedily as possible. I shall draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of the BRE's director. It is not easy, as the hon. Gentleman knows, but as sponsoring Minister for the BRE I shall happily deal with the matter. Indeed, I am to undertake an official visit in the near future and I shall mention the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I recall, the hon. Gentleman said that, if we are not careful when BRE is notified that it should carry out a study, there is a danger that that could blight the property. I accept that point. Perhaps it should be dealt with more secretly. Naturally, the Government are well equipped to deal with matters secretly, as everyone knows—including the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a defective dwelling under section 528 of the Housing Act 1985 is a dwelling which is or forms part of a building that is defective by means of "design or construction". The reference is to those two factors alone and not to the geological stratum on which such dwellings are built. That must be made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) mentioned that Smith properties in Sandwell have additional problems resulting from subsidence. We know of those cases. The council is seeking a higher expenditure approval limit for them and it will be considered on its merits. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, I should be familiar with the problem of cavity ties in Rochdale because it is my home town. I receive about one letter a week on the matter. That type of work can be funded either through renovation, under part VII of the Bill, or through group repair schemes. I shall do whatever I can to help in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the problem of Skarne houses in Peterlee. One and a half years ago, the Building Research Establishment published a major and reassuring report on large panel systems dwellings. The Building Societies Association subsequently recommended that its members should treat houses of that type, such as Bison and Skarne, on their individual merits, as those of conventional construction. The same applies to BISF houses. BRE gave exactly the same opinion on BISF houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is firm evidence from the policies of major building societies, such as the Halifax and the Abbey National that such advice is now widely accepted. I am glad to put that on the record, to commit them as far as I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to Skarne and Bison houses, but no doubt other constructions come under the large panel design, for example, Shepherds. In our area, in the 1950s, Shepherds was active in building houses for incoming mineworkers. Those houses now have construction and design defects. Several types of houses are of the large panel design. No such type should be omitted from any scheme or proposals. I refer especially to the Shepherd houses in the Wakefield area. If the Minister has proposals for large panel system houses, all such houses should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tripper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful, as the hon. Gentleman will accept. I have been most careful in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1222</span>
my remarks because I am trying to be as positive as I can about unregistered properties. Shepherds homes are not registered, rather like Bison, Skarne and BISF, and the hon. Gentleman and I are both under an obligation to do all that we can to ensure that such properties are not blighted. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that such a type of house should be included in any new initiative by the Department or in an approach to building societies. However, because it is not registered and does not qualify under defective housing, as do Smith homes, I have difficulty in agreeing to his request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interest in these matters is not confined to the Opposition Benches. My hon. Friend knows that other Conservative Members and I have in our constituencies non-traditional houses that have problems. I am grateful for the Minister's sound advice on the BISF houses, which have been the subject of correspondence and for the care with which he responded to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am not being falsely modest when I say that the compliment should go to my senior officials who have done tremendous work with the building societies. It is easy for Ministers to say that they will start the process. We attracted regional publicity for the BISF homes and I was on television, but much of the donkey work was done by the civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to houses included in the list. The 1985 Act included certain properties, but since then other properties have been identified as defective in design and construction. When will the Government update their list to include such properties? Is the Building Research Establishment at fault in not bringing forward further proposals? If so, when will that organisation be approached? People are troubled by the matter and it should not be taken lightly. When will the scheme be reviewed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the debate that no one takes the matter lightly, least of all me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, the BRE should decide whether the homes that we are talking about are registered as defective. That is the point of the mini debate that the hon. Member for Leeds, West and I had on the issue. I cannot castigate the BRE for not designating something that the hon. Member for Normanton believes should be designated. This is a technical matter. The BRE is saying, "Look, more or less everybody's home has defects of one form or another." My home is probably defective in some regard. The BRE is asking if the homes are so defective—compared with those with which the hon. Member for Normanton and I are familiar—that they require special assistance to reach a certain standard. Should they receive assistance over and above what private house owners in the round normally receive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Originally, there was a list of six designated types of house, including Cornish Unity, Wates, Myton, Wimpey No Fines and Airey, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1223</span>
it is not merely a matter of designated and non-designated types. There is a check list of categories of fault that includes spoiling concrete and defective wall tiles, for example. It is not only that regular repairs have not been done; key flaws in the properties identify those that should go on the list. I believe that the list was extended to about a dozen to include Tarran, Kencast and Laing Easiform. The problem is that some types are blighted when they are put forward for designation, and the BRE needs to decide whether they fall within the check list of substantial defects. It is not enough that they are or are not on the list. Some are queuing up to be tested to discover whether they should be on the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we should speedily decide whether such houses are to be designated and put on the list. However, we do not expect any further major designations under the legislation. I lost the hon. Member for Leeds, West when he said that it could revolve around the time factor and the cut-off time. The Bill is geared to give assistance when the defect is a bolt from the blue and the problems could not reasonably have been discovered on sale, purchase or survey—hence a cutoff date is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the categories to which the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Normanton referred, it has been widely known for some time that the properties are defective. Whether they are up to the standard that has been registered is another matter. It is not for me to say that there will not be other examples. God forbid, there may well be others, and they will have to be dealt with when they arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not concern my constituency, but I ask the Minister to look at the situation of tenants in Kidsgrove, whom I have met. They described what happened to them as a bolt from the blue, which is exactly what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will happily give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, the cut-off date applies to designated properties. If eligible owners sell after the cut-off date, they lose their entitlement because the scheme in the clause is to help owners who are actually in the property when the problem becomes generally known. I do not think that that was generally known during our debate on the subject in Committee. I appreciate that I am spending considerable time on the matter, but the Opposition spokesman made fair points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is making good progress. Nearly half the 33,000 eligible owners in England and Wales have received assistance. Nearly 8,000 repairs have been completed or are underway and over 9,000 houses have been repurchased. In Scotland, where there are far fewer eligible owners, the figure is 590—appreciably less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to reject the new clause, principally because we do not expect any further major designations under the legislation. Subsection
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1224</span>
(1) of the amendment would delete the references to a cut-off date for assistance. It would, therefore, breach the fundamental principle that the scheme should help only those owners who could not have been expected to know that the property that they were buying was defective and who, therefore, paid a price which took no account of the problem. A cutoff date was chosen for each designated house type because that was when, in the Secretary of State's opinion, the fact that the houses were defective should have been generally known. There is a further 12 months' safety net for owners who bought in ignorance of the defects and paid a price that did not properly reflect those defects. Owners who bought after that time but consider that they face hardship, should seek professional advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I ask the Committee to reject new clause 15, but commend new clause 27 and the consequential amendment No. 843, which will include that provision in the list of measures that will apply in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is disappointing that the Minister is not prepared to accept an amendment which would assist the people who are now trapped in defective housing and cannot move because no one wants to purchase their house and they cannot raise a loan. It is disappointing that people caught innocently in that way receive no assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the Minister offered no advice or assistance about the future. The HIP allocation will not tackle the other two thirds of the 32,000 such houses. That means that between 1985 and 1989 only 8,000 houses were referred. That is a disappointing record and is because resources have not been allocated. It is a thousand pities that the Minister has offered nothing to help those people. That is why the Opposition wish to press new clause 15 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief. I do not claim responsibility for the idea behind the new clause, nor has it come from the Labour party. It is the inspiration of the National Home Improvement Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of providing an incentive for saving that would lead to further improvement of individual homes, and therefore of housing stock, is worth a second thought from both major political parties. Designated savings schemes approved by the Government and leading to a 25 per cent. additional grant being made available to people who want funds to improve, repair or renovate their homes, has great merit. It would encourage people to save at a time when savings have dropped to their lowest level for some time. It would encourage people to invest in improvement and repair, rather than to buy on, causing house inflation. It would also give people an incentive to ensure that their money is supplemented by small extra amounts by the community as a whole. Thus it would provide the improvements needed in the housing and savings, and would develop a responsible attitude towards repairing and renovating homes. For all those reasons this is an excellent notion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that new clause 18 is an excellent notion, although I appreciate the way in which the hon. Member for Brightside moved it. I think that it is meant to be a reincarnation of the home loan scheme that we debated at length last week. I am eternally grateful to the hon. Gentleman for not delaying the Committee for much longer.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1227</span>
There are two reasons why the new clause would not be appropriate. First, how could it effectively target those who most need assistance? The scheme that the hon. Gentleman proposes is universal; anyone can benefit from it if they carry out repair and improvement work. It is a less effective way of helping people than the grant system that we debated under part VIII of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brightside may remember that neither the Standing Committee, nor a Committee debating the matters under an order has ever divided. Opposition Members seem to accept that the improvement grants available should be carefully targeted on those who are in real need, rather than used to encourage what is loosely termed, "yuppydom". It would be as objectionable to me as it would be to the Opposition for the yuppies to draw improvement grants when they can well afford to carry out improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why I do not like the new clause is because the scheme would be run by various savings institutions. To make it worth their while, it would need to expand rapidily. A slow expansion would mean that the scheme would fall into the same difficulty as the home loan scheme. The administrative cost would be disproporationate to the volume of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to reject the new clause. Nevertheless we should continue to consider all new ideas on this front, as we should not be so arrogant as to think that we know all the answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not divide the Committee, but we should like the idea to be further explored. Much of the savings currently going into housing is not improving property but increasing purchase prices. We agree with the Minister that yuppies would take advantage of being able to buy, sell and buy again. That is how many people have been able to make substantial gains in the property market in certain parts of the country.

	<div class='title'>DISTRESS FOR RENT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of restraint is the process by which a bailiff is appointed to seize a tenant's possessions if a local authority or other landlord feels that he has not paid his rent. The new clause suggests that landlords of secure tenants, who can levy distress for rent without the sanction of the courts, should not be able to do so. In other words, it would simply extend to secure tenants the same protection that is afforded to assured tenants, and it is based on section 19 of the Housing Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I do not have to say too much about the process. Perhaps it is not commonly known that bailiffs are expected to call between the hours of sunrise and sunset. I am at a loss to explain why that is. There are real inconsistencies in the practice. If the bailiff arrives—this is without a court order—and a window is open, he can get in to check on and remove belongings. He cannot break the window to get in. If a person leaves his car on the road outside it cannot be seized, but it can be if he parks it in the drive. The law of distraint is a mess. I hope that the Minister will agree that it is an unacceptable practice and that cases should be taken through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this method of getting rent back is used, there is no independent check. There is not even a check to see whether the person owes the amount of rent that is claimed. There should be a court hearing to enable a check to be made and to give the tenant a say. Whether it is a case of obtaining redress or coming to an arrangement to pay, that would obviously be much better than the present process whereby bailiffs can seize the belongings of tenants and sell them to pay what are only alleged rent arrears until they are proven in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment published a helpful document in 1983 about preventing rent arrears and the points it made put the case firmly against the use of distraint. It is better to go through the courts, not least because many of those with rent arrears are on low incomes, as has been pointed out by the National Consumer Council and others. Only a few authorities use the method now. It is used for relatively small amounts of money in terms of the authority's budget, although it can mean a lot to the individual. Our new clause is modelled on section 19 of the 1988 Act and it would bring the position of secure tenants into line with that of tenants in the other main housing sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will still have remedies. They will still have methods to recover rents. They can take court proceedings for repossession and for the debt itself and arrangements on how it should be paid. I hope that the Minister will support our new clause and say that we ought to outlaw this practice which, as the law stands, instructs the bailiff to be outside the law. It is not clear within what parameters he can operate. To bring the whole procedure within the framework of the law it is perhaps simplest to insert this new clause into the 1988 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the speech that the hon. Member for Leeds, West has just made. I shall try to persuade him and his colleagues that this is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1229</span>
not the right time to bring forward such a new clause. I should be fascinated to know who is briefing him on this. It may be some local authority association, but even then I should be surprised. I should have thought that that would not have been a unanimous view among all the local authorities in that association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of local authorities are now giving an undertaking to Ministers in the Department of the Environment that they will take serious action on rent arrears. It may well be that the powers are used only in a minority of cases, but I should have thought that they were a useful weapon to have in the armoury. He has heard me say on a number of occasions that, amazingly, the leader of Liverpool city council is prepared to take serious action on rent arrears in the city of Liverpool, and not before time. I should have thought that he would require this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, it would send the wrong signals to local authorities with rent arrears. As we are desperate to get on today, it being our last sitting, and we want unison, I shall not make the obvious political points about which are the offending authorities and who controls them. To do so would be less than kind. I ask the Committee to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in how the Minister handled my point. He spoke about rent arrears in general. The give-away was his phrase "the weapon". He is saying that any weapon should be used to recoup rent arrears. My point is that there are different kinds of methods to tackle rent arrears, some of which are legal processes which Opposition Members support as an appropriate means of collecting rent if a person has fallen into arrears. The system of distraint is half in and half out of the law. No one seems to know. The Minister may say that not all authorities support the idea. I recall that recently Gloucester made if clear that it will not use the power. The Association of District Councils said that it was not an appropriate method of collecting unpaid rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that he does not mind how rent arrears are collected? Is he saying that if a person can get in through a window, that is legitimate, but that if he breaks the window, that is illegitimate? Is he saying that it is irrelevant that people's possessions can be taken in that way? Is he saying that it is irrelevant that people cannot tell the bailiff that their rent was not paid because the message did not come through from the DSS to the local authority that their housing benefit was out of order? If a person cannot go to court, he cannot even make that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause draws attention to the appropriate, legitimate, lawful ways of establishing whether a person is in rent arrears. The appropriate action to get that rent back should be taken through the courts and not through the rather antiquated fashion of the bailiff being allowed out between sunrise and sunset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to see distraint of goods being used in every case and I appreciate that it does not have wide application. In issuing its 1987

circular, the DHSS listed the graduated sequence of actions from debt counselling to eviction. If we were to accept the new clause, we would send the wrong signals to local authorities over the collection of rent arrears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could perhaps do better by sending the 	<i>Hansard</i> report round to local authorities and making it clear that no one is saying that there should not be an appropriate method of collecting rent arrears. The issue is the appropriate manner of doing so. I urge my hon. Friends to support the new clause and to outlaw the malpractice of distraint by bailiffs. That is an option that should cease. I am not saying that people should not be challenged if they are in arrears, but that they should have the right to go before the court and state their case. At that stage, appropriate steps can be taken, which we accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

New clause 20 checks an anomaly that is built into the Housing Act 1985. Under existing legislation, a secure tenant of a housing association would be unable to assign his tenancy by mutual exchange to an assured tenant of a housing association. That is the gap that we seek to close.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee stages of the 1988 Bill, assurances were given by the Minister, but problems could arise if a secure tenant wished to exchange with an assured tenant, because section 91 of the Housing Act 1985 says that a secure tenancy is incapable

<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 seeks to restore the security of tenure given by the Housing Act 1985 to tenants of fully mutual co-operatives that are not registered with a housing corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is aware that before 1980, tenants of fully mutual co-operatives had no security of tenure, and a tenancy could be ended purely by giving four weeks' notice to quit. Tenants' property was not covered by the Rent Act 1977 and the position was exploited by landlords, particularly those in the London borough of Haringey. Bogus co-operatives were formed by seven people registering with the registrar of friendly societies as a co-operative. It then bought a property with sitting tenants protected by the Rent Act and, as soon as the co-op became the landlord, the tenants lost Rent Act protection and were served a notice to quit to enable their former homes to be sold with vacant possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following pressure from the National Federation of Housing Associations, the Housing Act 1980 was amended to close the loophole and tenants of fully mutual co-operatives that were not registered with the Housing Corporation were included in the secure tenancy regime with full tenants' charter rights. The provision stopped the previous abuse and was considered valuable enough to be carried forward into the Housing Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1232</span>
After the 1988 Act the rights of tenants of unregistered fully mutual co-operatives have worsened. All fully mutuals, registered and unregistered, are excluded from the assured tenancy. Because of repeals to section 80 of the 1985 Act, new tenants of unregistered fully mutuals may be back to their pre-1980 status with no security and no supervision by the Housing Corporation of their landlords' policies and practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no worry about fully mutual co-operatives, which are registered with the Housing Corporation. If these landlords try to abuse their tenants' lack of security, the corporation has sanctions under the Housing Associations Act 1985 and can ultimately close them down. No similar supervision exists for unregistered fully mutuals. Their tenants now have no security under the Rent Act 1977, the Housing Act 1985 or the 1988 Act. The loop has been exploited before by unscrupulous landlords and the opportunity now exists again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would amend section 80 of the 1985 Act so that unregistered fully mutual co-operatives would continue to grant secure tenancies. There would be no opportunities for the abuses of the late 1970s to reappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty. It was our understanding that the National Federation of Housing Co-operatives was entirely happy with our proposals. Unless the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) intervenes and says, "I am sorry, but the Minister's got it wrong," I shall assume that the NFHC is still in agreement. If he says that he is being assisted by the National Federation of Housing Associations, which is unhappy with our proposals, that is a different matter and I shall examine it carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tarfaen must take it from me that we have gone to extreme lengths to meet the fears of the housing co-operative movement which we are keen to support, as is the Labour party. There is no political difference between us. We decided to take new ownership co-op tenancies out of statutory control because we believed that that was in the co-ops' interest. More importantly, it was what the co-op movement wanted and what the NHFC told us that it wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to place the hon. Member for Torfaen in any difficulty, but perhaps he could check. If there is a difference of opinion, it would save time if the organisation assisting him could write to me directly and discuss the matter with me or with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the housing co-operative movement is delighted with the present arrangement and sees no reason for change. We might get into a terrible mess if I suggested alterations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my colleague for giving way.

I am delighted to receive the Minister's assurances and shall not wish to press the new clause—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I did not catch all the Minister's words.

There are anomalies in rental purchase that I should have thought the Minister would want to rectify. I assume that he is looking as contently at his brief as I am at mine. I was not especially conversant with rental purchase as it is a form of tenure that we do not experience much in the south-east, I am delighted to say. However, I am reliably informed that it is a form of tenure that falls awkwardly between tenancy and owner-occupation, and that residents often end up with few of the advantages of either. New clause 23 seeks to give them added protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that that form of tenure is found mainly in the north-west of England. I am assured

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend who may like to remind the Minister that there was an Adjournment debate in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) because that same company crossed the boundaries of the north-west. We were given assurances well over 12 months ago that that matter would be tackled, so I hope that the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) will receive a positive response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so, too. Perhaps my hon. Friend will tell me who the Minister was who replied to that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Member for Bristol, West bank. I know him well. He is a halfway decent sort of fellow and I am surprised that nothing has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who have rental purchase agreements are in grave danger of having virtually no rights whatever. They are at the mercy of unscrupulous people. The new clause will ensure that all rental purchasers who enter agreements when the Bill is enacted, will have the status of assured tenants under the Housing Act 1988 until such time as the title of the property has been transferred to them. If that is not achieved, such residents will be in a state of limbo and left without the effective rights of either tenants or owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall keep my brief by me as if any of my constitutents have rental purchase agreements, I shall ask them some of the questions referred to in it. There are great problems with security against eviction. Private tenants have substantial protection from the Rent Acts against eviction, but that does not apply to rental purchase agreements, some of which state that when six weeks' payments have been missed, the rental purchase company will apply to the court to repossess the property. Again, it seems that people who enter into such agreements are sometimes asked to have the loan guaranteed by a relative, instead of making a deposit. If the guarantee is secured against the guarantor's home, that home could be put at risk if the rental purchase home is repossessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters get worse. If a house has been repossessed under the rental purchase agreement, the person may lose all that he has already paid towards the house, plus any deposit. If the rental purchase company goes bankrupt, the person who has entered into the agreement could lose his home through no fault of his. This form of tenure must be one of the most insecure that there is. People entering into these agreements could lose a great deal of money and be evicted relatively easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1236</span>
The rate of interest in such agreements is usually much higher than one would pay on a conventional mortgage—25 per cent. and above is common. Although the Government have been busily pushing up the mortgage rate, that is more than twice the rate that one would pay through a building society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister was prepared to give way on the previous new clause he should be willing to give way on new clause 23, which I moved—after I found the correct brief—and which would do much to enhance security in an area where there seems to be little security left. As we move towards the end of Committee stage, I hope that the Minister will be prepared to make a concession, if only by saying that he will consider the matter and return to it at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and shall not detain the Committee. I have been involved with a company that I will not name, but which was named in earlier debates and which crosses the Pennines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is not only that people could lose their homes and get evicted easily, but that they may find that they must pay back thousands of pounds, because they have been switched into a purchase scheme. They could be homeless and still have to pay back a mortgage. It was conceded in the debate and agreed across the Chamber that that 25 per cent. interest rate was being paid back by people who had been unemployed and who had been persuaded that they could purchase, using their housing benefit as the mortgage payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Adjournment debate I was assured by the Minister that the housing benefit loophole would be closed. That is the purpose of the new clause. There is a loophole in the law that has been ruthlessly exploited by some companies. One of the ways of closing the loophole would be by ensuring that they would not be entitled to get housing benefit from their tenants and switch it across to phoney mortgage agreements. I do not hesitate to use that expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that there has been movement—I shall not say to outlaw the practice, but more positively to bring the practice firmly within the context of the law, so that people know where they are. The people whom I have faced have not only lost their homes, but have then gone through the courts and, having been told to repay on a back-to-back house in the army area, found that they owed £15,000 to £20,000 that they thought was being paid through housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no shortage of sympathy among Conservative Members for the examples of what could go wrong that were given by the hon. Members for Newham, North-West and for Leeds, West. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave), the then Minister for Housing, gave an undertaking in a letter to the hon. Member for Leeds, West on 10 March 1988. He said,
	<br><q><p>"You have my assurance that we shall consider the AMA survey very carefully when we receive it, and look into the implications of its findings."</p></q>
We have still not received the results of that survey. For all I know it is still going on—although I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1237</span>
that it is not. Even if it has been completed, we cannot consider how we should react until we are notified of its findings. I have no doubt that what the hon. Member for Newham, North-West has said will form part of the evidence. We shall consider, too, the examples given by the hon. Member for Leeds, West both today and in his Adjournment debate. The hon. Gentlemen should urge the AMA to get on with the survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave), who is now Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, did not reply to that Adjournment debate. The hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe), who was then a Minister, replied. The survey is one factor, but the letter was dated March 1988 and I was assured that the loophole would be closed by April of that year when the changes in housing benefit occurred, yet the practice continues to this day. It is happening now in Leeds. Has there been any chance of closing the loophole? The survey is needed to find out how far the practice extends throughout the country, but we must also find out whether the benefit system is being abused for the purpose of making money on property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have before me a copy of and letter sent by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne, but I have a copy of the letter sent by the former Minister for Housing, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave). I assure the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) that if the new clause is withdrawn I shall consider the two matters separately and return to them later. I now ask the hon. Member for Newham, North-West to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will find that his predecessor, the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe), was examining the matter when she became one of the Ministers to get the order of the boot from the Secretary of State for the Environment.

That is an odd argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I am not offering him the poisoned chalice today. I was about to say that I now understand where the confusion lies. I remember with what mental skill and agility the hon. Member for Broxbourne steered through the Housing Bill in 1988. It is indelibly imprinted on our minds. We shall never forget those experiences and I do not suppose that the hon. Lady will, either.

Whatever fate befalls Ministers, they are still held collectively responsible, so I assume that the assurances given by the hon. Member for Broxbourne
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1238</span>
during her short but devastatingly effective career as a Minister will be honoured. I think that the Minister can feel easy in his mind that the same fate is unlikely to befall him—even though there is some similarity between his hairstyle and that of the hon. Member for Broxbourne. While his head, with his hairstyle, still sits comfortably on his shoulders—unlike that of the hon.

I hope that the Government will automatically accept the new clause on the grounds that it has not only logic but existing Government intentions on its side. Schedule 3A of the 1985 Act has proved a shambles, as is recognised by everyone, including the Government and the Housing Corporation. On 22 March, the Housing Corporation issued guidance that would be in line with the new clause. Section 61 of the 1988 Act, dealing with housing action trust ballots, fits in perfectly with the new clause, too, so on every possible count we expect the Government to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will obviously be worries when a Act is so confused that it leads to difficulties with implementation. There are additional dangers for district councils with the voluntary transfer of housing to another landlord. Hon. Members will be aware of the considerable confusion that arose out of the provision in the 1985 Act, which did not require a 50 per cent. or more affirmative vote by tenants eligible to vote. The motion would make such a procedure a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware of the confusion of Torbay council under the voluntary transfer provision. It has been publicised widely. When refusing that district council's proposal, the Secretary of State had to take into account the fact that more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1239</span>
than 50 per cent. of those eligible to vote had signed a petition against the transfer. The original consultation had not led to a 50 per cent. vote, although it had led to a majority vote against transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, tenants of councils such as Salisbury, Arun, Rochford and Three Rivers have voted against transfer. It is interesting that the Liberal and Social Democrats on Three Rivers district council decided to use this Bill as a reason for their supporting voluntary transfer. They threatened the tenants with the likely consequences of the Bill on rate changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That council's behaviour has been more than equalled by some Conservative-controlled councils, which disgracefully used the threat of rent increases to encourage their tenants to adhere to voluntary transfer. Swale district council in Kent said that its rents would increase by 26 per cent. in the first year, 40 per cent. in the second year and 20 per cent. in the third year if tenants stayed under its control, but that they would increase by only 1 or 2 per cent. above inflation if tenants transferred. Councils cannot be more blatant than that, except Redbridge council, which said that it would increase its rents by 31 per cent. to encourage its tenants to opt out, even though it had transferred its £6 million profit to the general fund. If tenants are to protect themselves against such unscruplous action, voting arrangements must be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1985 Act mentioned only consultation. It did not lay down a formal procedure for ballots and polls. Our motion, by using section 61 of the Housing Act 1988 as its model, would clarify such arrangements. On the grounds of equity, fairness, past practice, the guidance given on 22 March and the legislation making sense, we hope that Conservative Members accept the motion. In so doing—they have already accepted the sense of new clause 20—they will enable me to say that I was only 95 per cent. right in my accusations at the start of our proceedings, when I said that nothing would be passed in Committee except 'flu and bad colds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing could be more confusing than to change the rules governing voting procedures for large-scale voluntary transfers. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the matter was debated exhaustively, not under the 1988 Act, but when the Opposition welcomed the long-stop provision written into the 1985 Act. What is not generally understood is the fact that large-scale voluntary transfers of housing could have taken place over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most compelling comment that I can make is that there is no reason why a local authority should not impose its own conditions and a more stringent test upon itself. It might follow the advice of the Electoral Reform Society and adopt a test of the simple majority of those who vote. As it happens, most authorities which have carried out tenant consultations have used the simple majority test, and the society. We have no objection. It would not matter if we had, because an authority would not submit an applicaton unless it had obtained the necessary majority. It is for the authority, not the Secretary of State, to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1240</span>
The principal reason why I invite the Committee to reject the hon. Gentleman's new clause and his argument is that we have gone to extreme lengths to publish suitable material that, even now, might meet the objections of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, because what is to happen will be made clear to the tenant. I should hate to have to unravel all that and go to the great expense, for taxpayers, of having to go back to the beginning when it has taken until now to get the message across. I know that, in the spirit of our proceedings on this, the final day of our deliberations, the hon. Member for Brightside will withdraw his new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the Minister is not getting away with that. The Committee will notice that we are not talking of other organisations transferring housing, only local authorities. What underlies this is the Government's dislike of local authority housing and local authority tenants. The issue here is a negative, instead of a positive, form of voting. I will return to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the proposal that the hon. Member for Brightside asks the Committee to consider precisely the reverse? Does he not want to do all that he can to prevent local authority tenants moving to choose an alternative landlord?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. As even the Minister pointed out, it would be possible to transfer housing stock. Many Labour local authorities have done that for a number of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A small number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Many more Labour than Conservative authorities. They have done it whenever they thought it appropriate. Transfer was determined, first, by what tenants wanted—which should be the deciding factor—and, secondly, by the arrangements that follow between housing associations, housing co-operatives and the local authority. It has worked well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister constantly ducks the fact that this is not allowed of a private sector tenant, although we know that it is in the private sector that all the abuses occur. That is where the Rachmans and the Hoogstraatens are, and in the worst possible form. No local authority has come anywhere near the behaviour of the Hoogstraatens and Rachmans of this world. I defy any Conservative Member to produce any such example from a Labour, Tory or Liberal council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment's evidence confirms that the worst landlords are in the private sector. The Building Societies Association's survey confirms that the most unpopular sector with tenants is the private sector, especially the private furnished sector. None is to be allowed to transfer under the Government's new system. The aim is to push, bully and shove local authority tenants out of local authority control where, on the whole, they have received a far better deal. That is why the number of people who are queueing for council housing has increased by about half a million in the past eight or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1241</span>
nine years although the Government describe it as the unpopular sector. Their number is now 1.25 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can it possibly be suggested that tenants who have the opportunity to vote—we are talking now of large-scale voluntary transfers—are in any way bullied? They are able to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister of the Torbay example, which he knows well. Torbay tenants talked of being bullied. If he wants to know what takes place, he can talk to the secretary of the Torbay tenants association. He was not involved in the first vote. He said, "I didn't bother at first. It didn't worry me. I didn't think it mattered. Then I saw what it meant and I got involved."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an attempt to pull the wool over our eyes. The two housing associations in Torbay were well meaning, but there was anxiety, stress and, above all, uncertainty about whether housing associations can deliver on rent levels—the Government are cutting housing association grants—or on security of tenure. Tenants are frightened and that is what is going wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has just admitted that the housing associations in Torbay were well meaning about the transfer, why on earth did he not say so publicly at the time as shadow spokesman for housing? The hon. Gentleman spends a disproportionate amount of time running around the country trying to put the fear of God into tenants by describing events that could never happen. He is the person guilty of bullying, and no one else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that, and my remarks were broadcast on local television and radio and reported in the papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was on the BBC and TVS. I also told the two housing associations. If the Minister wants to check, he can easily get on the telephone to them. I talked to both housing associations and told them explicitly that I was convinced that their motives were good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A central part of my message to housing associations wherever I speak on the issue is that, by and large, housing associations and even management buy-outs which are becoming increasingly common, are well intentioned, but housing associations and management buy-outs often do not realise that many tenants in council sector stock to not understand that a housing association is radically different from a conventinal private landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1242</span>
Further, council tenants are rightly worried that rent levels, and statements about assured tenancies are not as concrete as they are said to be. There is no way in which a housing association can guarantee that it will hold rent levels, as some of them initially thought, because of the cost of the transfer, housing association grant cuts and the unpredictability of future Government funding arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implications of assured tenancies are even more devastating. We have said consistently, and Conservative Members almost accept, that we cannot legitimately, and certainly not in terms of legal interpretation, say that an assured tenancy is as secure as a secure tenancy. It is much weaker. Under an assured tenancy, a tenant can be evicted in several ways that do not apply under a secure tenancy. The difference is crucial because people understand it. Assured tenancies have weaknesses on rent arrears, major works to the property and security of tenure for a son or daughter caring for an elderly relative. All those factors affect tenants. Few people in their right minds who understand the implications are willing to accept a transfer from a secure tenancy to an assured tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If you held the tenancy of your house on a leasehold, Mr. Hunt, you would not accept a change in the terms of your lease if you were suddenly told that the freeholder could change your rent, evict you if he wished to carry out major works or prevent your son or daughter from continuing to live in the property after your death. You, Mr. Hunt, would not accept those terms and no solicitor would advise you to, yet the Minister accepts it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question is whether the Minister would accept a transfer in which fewer than 50 per cent. of tenants voted. We want a positive voting system. If more than 50 per cent. of tenants eligible to vote say, "Yes, we are prepared to be transferred," there is a strong democratic argument for transferring all the properties. If fewer than 50 per cent. vote, and we fall into the trap of allowing abstentions to win the day as they did initially in Torbay, we cannot automatically assume that everyone knows the implications and is willing to transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three Rivers was a classic example. Even though I was not there, people were being turned away at the door. The meeting was attended by 400 or 500 people, which shows how much anxiety there is. If that continues, the Minister is clearly causing tenants, especially older tenants, a great deal of worry about the future of their homes.
