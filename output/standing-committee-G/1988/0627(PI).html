<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to be brief, but this is an important issue, which does not divide the Committee. On several occasions during our proceedings we have tried to consider, cooperatively, ways to improve the law, and I hope that the new clause provides another opportunity for the Government to see the sense in what we say and to react positively to it. I also hope to receive some support from Conservative Back Benches and to prove that occasionally there can be a spirit of unity in the Committee. As I said, such an occurence has not been so unusual in our proceedings over the past two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To many people bingo is important; I do not play myself, but I know that it is a social game and an amusement—although it does not necessarily require a great deal of brain energy—and, as such, is loved by many people. The limits for exempt bingo—where duty is not payable—are low, have not been increased for several years, and stand at £400 for one day's prizes, and £1,000 for one week's prizes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is modest and seeks only to bring the figures up to date. We have calculated that to do so the £400 limit should be increased to £450, and the £1,000 to £1,500. The sums might have been a little less, but we wanted to produce a sensible new clause, which would restore the position that was created by statutory instrument. There may be 100 or 200 people at a bingo session, playing in one room, at 5p a card, and some people will be sufficiently skilful to take three, four or five cards at the same time and to check off the numbers as they are called. Thus the takings in a house can be £20, £30 or £40, and if six houses are played in an afternoon or evening session, the takings may total £250. Of course, some of the money is retained by the club, but a great deal of it is given out in prizes, and if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>630</span>
£250 can be taken in an afternoon session, there is some danger of the £1,000 limit being exceeded in a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that social clubs should have to pay bingo duty if their activities are social and on a small scale, and if the game is provided for the amusement of their members. I hope that the Committee will not insist that such clubs should have to go to the extra administrative trouble of paying bingo duty. The limit of £1,000 is low. Will the Government increase it by a modest amount? We suggest £1,500. Many of the problems and difficulties of treasurers in social clubs would then be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some of my hon. Friends will support what I have said, and that the Minister has listened carefully and will give a favourable reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the agreeable things that I have discovered during my two years in the House, confirmed by the general tenor of the Committee, is that many activities and interests cross party lines. I am pleased to participate—albeit in a small way—as a member of the all-party clubs group. Various distinguished hon. Members are involved, who have raised the matter on previous occasions. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) will remember exchanges during last year's Finance Bill that were prompted by my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts). I know that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) and the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Welsh) have seen the Minister about that. I should be pleased and interested to hear the result of those consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is generally accepted that the purely social activities of clubs—of which bingo is a significant, but not unique part—should be separated from the activities of commercial bingo clubs. If there is no significant pressure from the commercial clubs about unfair competition and level playing fields, and if mainly social activities are involved, I hope that the Minister will respond to the spirit of the new clause, which is not partisan and which will give a little encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us with children will know that it is necessary to take two or three blows at the birthday candles before they all go out. As we are nearing the conclusion of this matter, I hope that the Minister will be able to help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated this topic in the previous Finance Bill Committee of which I was a member, and it was debated on many occasions before that. The reason that we were given last year for not making changes was that, although the Government were sympathetic to the needs of clubs and to removing some of the pressures, the great difficulty was competition from commercial bingo arcades. I recall that the cost was not an obstacle—the Minister said that the problem was not the cost, but the pressure from competition or potential competitors. If there is no pressure from competitors, the way is open to make that small change. I hope that we can end our debate with a satisfactory conclusion, which will not cost the

Government much money but which will make much difference to the quality, even the survival, of many local clubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be careful in my speech, following that of the hon. Member for Corby—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. I am the hon. Member for Daventry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will remember that in the debate on village halls and VAT, and the effect on the social life of many communities, I came strongly to your defence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need defending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, Mr. Cormack, you remember that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we persuaded the Government to accept this modest new clause, it would give great assistance to non-profit making clubs, which give considerable service and fulfil an important role in our social life. It is to be applauded and we should give as much encouragement as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commercial bingo operators apparently have no objection to the proposal. In January 1989, in reply to a question on bingo duties, the Minister said that if they had been inflation proofed between 1981 and 1989, the figure would be £420 daily and £1,400 weekly. Our new clause seeks little more than that and, in general, it would seem a fair way to go today. I hope that the Committee will accept it because 6 to 7 million people use social clubs of all types. This Finance Bill Committee could bring them a little ray of happiness; if we do that, our lives will be worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner), who I know has played a considerable part in the all-party clubs group's work and in advancing causes such as this, which, although modest in its dimensions, is undoubtedly important in its social implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support new clause 8. As well as encouraging my hon. Friend the Minister to accept the new clause, I want to pay tribute to the work of the all-party clubs group. It is particularly refreshing to see my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) in Committee today. His leadership, and that of his opposite number from the Opposition Benches, the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Cunliffe), who for many years has done wonderful work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Cunliffe) is also present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek.) The record will show that. I am anxious that it should reveal that tremendous
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>632</span>
work has been done over a long period by hon. Members on both sides of the House. It would be a fitting tribute to their hard labours if the Government accepted new clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should point out that the only people present are those in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause, which proposes a modest easement in bingo duty, comes at a time when clubland is experiencing severe financial problems. My constituency has many clubs: CIUs—Club and Institute Union clubs—and others. I have seen them pass from a period of considerable prosperity and success to one of severe difficulties. That is true throughout neighbouring parts of Northumberland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, when the prosperity seemed so great, much expansion occurred. Clubs were in larger premises and big concert rooms were created. They are now facing heavy rate burdens, which will continue; the clubs have become financially badly squeezed. A period of higher unemployment in the north-east has hit them especially hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such clubs are often the main focus of social life in a community. Bingo income is one of the means by which they maintain their facilities and keep open. I stress to Ministers, who will have listened to the views of hon. Members from all parts of the Committee, expressing sympathy and concern for the clubs, that they should take particular notice of this long-standing plea now because, in recent years, the clubs have not faced the serious difficulties that they face now. The small easement of bingo duty would be one way of helping clubs overcome the difficulties encountered by voluntary, honorary committee members who bear a heavy burden of accounting and financial responsibility in increasingly hard times. I ask Ministers to take our plea seriously and to recognise how important it is to clubs in the north of England and in other parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you may be aware, Mr. Cormack, I spoke for the Opposition to a similar provision in last year's Finance Bill. I hope that the Government will make a satisfactory concession today so that we do not return to the matter in next year's Bill. I speak in what I hope is taken as a bipartisan spirit, to urge the Minister to make a concession now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two arguments advanced last year against the concession were, first the legitimate interests of the Revenue and, secondly, the effect on commercial bingo organisations. We know now that commercial bingo organisations have no objection to a concession, nor should they. Commercial bingo is a quite different business from the small-scale bingo that we are discussing. Small-scale bingo is a prop to, and an entertainment in voluntary clubs and community organisations. As my hon. Friends have said, it is becoming increasingly important, although it is by no means the main method by which clubs underpin their activities in the local communities that they serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>633</span>
Given the Government's fiscal surplus this year, surely the argument about the loss to the Revenue is very much at the margin. The concession would result in only a small loss, and it cannot be argued that there would be a spin-off into the rest of the economy. The advantages to voluntary clubs and to their communities would far outweigh any small loss to the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Voluntary clubs play a vital role in communities throughout the country, but they are especially important in inner-city areas. What I said last year bears repeating. If it were not for the Churches, the schools and the voluntary clubs in inner-city constituencies, there would be little focus for community life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, voluntary clubs in inner-city areas are under increasing financial pressure. Their operating costs have increased because of high unemployment and other problems associated with inner cities, while their sources of income have remained the same or decreased. It is unreasonable that the tax concession for small bingo should be slowly eroded when inner-city clubs are facing such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The erosion is also unfair to clubs which do not serve inner-city areas but which, as the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said, play a vital part in community life in rural areas. The clubs provide an important focus for every community in the country. It is difficult to think of a constituency that is not served by some aspect of the voluntary club movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary will have to come up with either a new explanation on why the concession cannot be made, or much more convincing arguments than those advanced last year. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) will be able to welcome a concession from the Economic Secretary, who has been asked for one by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) began by saying how agreeable it is to have cross-party agreement on an issue of this nature, and it is an impressive spectacle for me as a Minister to see unity not only between the parties but between Methodist lay preachers, hotfoot from hearing a condemnation of materialism, and high Anglicans from Corby hoping for larger bingo prizes. Faced with such unity, I am bound to consider the arguments carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to the arguments that have been advanced today. I pay tribute to the all-party group that has urged the case and, in particular, to the sustained and persistent campaign that has been pursued since the last Budget by my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, North (Mr. Knight) and for Slough (Mr. Watts), who are not present, despite the visual impression to the contrary that we are suffering—or enjoying. Because of the arguments that they have advanced, I have decided to make a change of the kind that is suggested in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause proposes to substitute the sums of £450 as the daily limit and £1,500 as the weekly limit.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>634</span>
As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner) was informed in answer to a written question, inflation-proofing alone would justify increases of £420 and about £1,400. Social law would indicate a somewhat higher figure, and I decided to opt for the higher figure. Therefore, I propose that the daily limit should be £500 and the weekly limit £1,500, but it is more appropriate for the increases to be introduced by order than by primary legislation. That would accord with normal practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the new clause will be withdrawn, and the increases can then be introduced by an order which will come into force from Monday 4 September. I am told that it is imperative that the order start on a Monday, but unfortunately no months that begin on a Monday are convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original purpose of the measure is not to raise revenue, of course, and the loss of revenue from the changes that I propose will be about £1½ million. But to protect commercial clubs, the smaller commercial clubs have made it known that they will not oppose a change of that nature, as several members of the Committee have said, and I hope that the Committee will find that agreeable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for the Opposition, may I thank the Economic Secretary for his very generous response, and speaking for everybody in the Committee, may I say that it has been a generous response? I suspect that I could be under attack from my colleagues because it looks as though the Opposition, for the first time, did not go far enough in their new clause, and that we should perhaps have been a little bolder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome what the Economic Secretary has said. The Opposition will expedite the passage of the order through the House, and I guarantee that there will be no problems with it. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The fact that the three new clauses are being taken together provides me with an opportunity to delve a little into their background.

I declare a double interest, in that I am secretary of the all-party parliamentary maritime group, and I am also a management consultant. I used to work for five different ship yards around the world. I have never worked for a shipping company, but our clients in those shipyards were shipping companies, and it saddened me that, year by year, Britain's place in the world ranking fell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past two years, there have been two major reports—one from the Select Committee on Transport, the other from the Select Committee on Defence—on the state of British merchant shipping. It would be wrong to go into those reports in detail, but I want to bring out three essential matters arising from them. First, by no stretch of anyone's imagination is there a level playing field in shipping today. We have the wrong end of the playing field, and I shall expand on that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and as a result, the tonnage of the United Kingdom-registered fleet shrank—according to page IX of the report by the Select Committee on Transport—by 80 per cent. between 1975 and 1986. Even the UK-owned fleet, much of which is not UK-manned, declined by 60 per cent. in the 10 years up to 1987, a figure taken from the table presented by the General Council of British Shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, our economy and defence are suffering serious consequences. In relation to the economy,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>636</span>
the sea transport account for 1987, which is agreed between the Department of Transport and the General Council of British Shipping, shows a deficit of £1.1 billion. I believe that it has increased since then. In spite of that net deficit, our revenue from UK shipping still accounted for 10 per cent. of all invisible earnings, showing how important shipping still is in tbe British economy. Indeed, 96 per cent. of all goods shipped to and from this country are carried by sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to defence, we are still awaiting the great NATO study on shortages in merchant shipping in the NATO area, which I understand will be available early next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report by the Select Committee on Defence spells out that it is unlikely that we would be able to mount another Falklands-type operation because of the decline in our UK-owned fleet. In times of global tension, for which the whole of our armed forces exist, we would be unable to cover both the requirement for military sealift and for essential economic shipping because we simply do not have the fleet to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to my right hon. and Learned Friends on the Front Bench that while another Falklands and increasing world tension may seem unlikely at the moment, the measures that we take will notice elsewhere and will be part of the way in which potential aggressors will assess our seriousness in defending ourselves and our vital interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to my specific tax measures—you have been lenient with me, Mr. Cormack. New clause 13 refers to rollover relief on corporation tax. It is worth comparing the overall corporation tax position for shipping companies in this country with that abroad. Greece has the only merchant fleet in Europe that has gained ground over the past 12 years. It declined for a while but is now picking up again, and it is now the second biggest merchant fleet in the world. There is no profits tax on merchant shipping in Greece. The only tax of any kind that it pays is a minuscule tonnage tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many other countries, such as Scandinavia, Germany and Japan, there are tax-free reserves. Depreciation allowances are higher in other countries: in France, 31 per cent., and in Germany, up to 40 per cent. There are special reduced rates for shipping in Denmark and, as I have already mentioned, in Greece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This modest new clause focuses on rollover relief, and I shall explain briefly how it works. When a company sells a vessel, or indeed any other capital assets, the written-down depreciated value of the vessel is taken and the difference between the written-down value and the amount for which the vessel is sold becomes a taxable amount on which tax is paid, unless the money is reinvested in shipping in the same year. The clause seeks only to give the shipowner a little bit more flexibility by allowing him an extra two years in which to reinvest the money in shipping before he has to pay it. That will particularly benefit all shipowners at present as the Select Committee on Transport showed clearly that the age profile of our merchant shipping is poor, as it is in most European countries, and our shipowners would be encouraged to reinvest if payment of tax were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>637</span>
deferred. The cost of doing that would be small. Such a measure already exists in Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Japan and the United States of America, over and above the incentives given by other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I move from corporation tax and new clause 13, I should stress—because my right hon. Friend the Minister will remind me—that we have a lower rate of corporation tax than most of our competitors in other countries. But the effective rate paid in those other countries is much lower for shipping companies, in almost every case, than it is here because of the array of measures that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly touch on people taxes in Greece, the Netherlands and Denmark, and in Belgium through the Luxembourg arrangement for registering its vessels. Shipowners pay lower rates of social charges and income tax. Sweden repays the tax and national insurance contributions taken from employees and gives them back to the shipowners. Norway also makes special reductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that we make funds available for repatriation and training costs, but less so than the EEC norm. It is also true that we allow a modest overseas allowance to our seafarers. The problem is that the arrangements for that are complicated and are not calculated until the year end and there is no way in which shipowners can benefit from them. The position of each seafarer is different, often within each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in many other countries subsidies exist which I shall not go into because they are well beyond the scope of this debate. However, they include investment, operating subsidies and so on. Cargo reservation is also widespread, particularly in Third world countries and for public sector cargoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 11 and 12 focus on the constructive British business expansion scheme. The concept of the BES is to encourage people, through a generous income tax allowance, to invest in certain areas. The limit for shipping is only £5 million, which was set a year ago. The problem is that the market for secondhand ships has moved so fast over the last year. According to the General Council of British Shipping it has gone up by 75 per cent. That figure is now so low as to be of comparatively little value—hence the proposal in new clause 11 to increase it from £5 million to £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the time limit of 12 months imposed on periods of charter sufficiently inhibits shipowners that it often makes it difficult for them to raise the rest of the loan finance. That is why we want to give them more flexibility by extending the period from 12 months to 60 months in new clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BES-type approach is unusual. The only other country that I know has such an approach is Norway, where there is no upper limit on amounts that can be invested in this way. The net result is that Norway has carved a substantial chunk out of the British North sea effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to show that there is no level playing field in shipping and that, as a result, we are suffering
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>638</span>
serious balance of payments and defence consequences, which is why I have tried to go into the specific measures that exist abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end by giving my right hon. Friend one thought. I can honestly claim always to have opposed special investment rates. For my sins, the first economic pamphlet I published six years ago called for the abolition of first-year capital allowances and regional investment grants before the abolition of first-year capital allowances became Government policy. I propose these breaks for shipping only because years of exposure to companies that deal with those exposed to that market have convinced me that we are dealing with the service equivalent of dumping. For reasons that are not only economic—they come back partly to national pride and partly to defence—we are up against competitors who are determined by every possible means, through fiscal and many other approaches, to subsidise and support their own players. That is why we must find a method of levelling the playing field. I recommend the new clause to my right hon Friend the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is, that the clause be read a Second time. If that can be done without any more level playing fields, I should be enormously grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has chosen the business expansion scheme as the vehicle for what he seeks to do in the shipping industry. An effect of new clause 11 is to increase the overall limit for business expansion scheme investment not only in shipping but in private rented housing. New clause 11 would double the effective limit and we certainly do not support it in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman identified issues of competition in the shipping industry that need careful examination, but we are unsure whether the hon. Gentleman's precise measures are the right way to go forward and are profoundly anxious about the fate of British shipbuilding capacity. The near elimination of shipbuilding capacity for our merchant shipping fleet has caused us considerable distress over many years. Expanding the clout of the shipping industry may simply mean that more foreign, second-hand ships are purchased to supply an expanded shipping industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shipping and shipbuilding industries should be looked at as a whole. Furthermore, we are not sure that using the vehicles or roll-over relief and the business expansion scheme are the correct way to go about doing that, although we accept that the problem needs to be tackled. We must examine how best our shipbuilding and merchant shipping capacity can be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) speaks with a special interest in the naval aspects of shipping. His interests are related to defence although, before he became a member of the House, he was closely involved in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>639</span>
commercial aspect of the industry. He has raised a matter that is extremely important and significant in proposing a structural change in the long-established pattern of world shipping, and in British shipping in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we had a much more generous system of capital allowances, including roll-over relief, it has very little impact on the decline of the fleet. To find causes of that phenomenon we must look at subsidies, as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury said, as well as at the staple capacity and structure of the industry and at the types of ships in the British fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury mentioned a serious phenomenon to which the Government are not indifferent. For that reason we have introduced several—admittedly limited—measures in the tax system to help a little at the margin. In 1985 provision was made for writing-down allowances to be available from the date expenditure is incurred instead of from the date that the asset is brought into use, which helps when a ship is purchased and when stage payments are made. Other changes were also made in 1985 to allow writing-down allowances to be rolled up and used at will which reduces the impact of the balancing charge about which my hon. Friend was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year's Finance Act contained several measures to help shipping. The 100 per cent. foreign earnings deduction was relaxed specifically to help the tax position of British seafarers and the £5 million limit within the business expansion scheme was introduced. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) pointed out that that was conspicuous compared with the tax placed on investments other than rented housing within the BES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury that subsidies may be deployed in other parts of the world, but we should be careful before we join the subsidy race and encourage investors in an industry whose basic problem over recent decades is over-capacity. The right approach is to encourage others to modify or forego their subsidies rather than to intensify and increase the subsidy rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury emphasised that we have seen a contraction in our fleet after a large, sustainable growth in the early 1960s and the 1970s. A large part of that contraction was in tanker tonnage—the reaction to the oil price rise in the 1970s which had devastating impact but which has continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the president of the General Council of British Shipping, Mr. Denholm, retired the other day, he spoke optimistically about how shipping markets were beginning to recover. He drew attention to charter rates, second-hand and new-built prices and the large decline in the number of ships laid up. He emphasised that that was part of the recovery phase in the cyclical shipping market which underlines the need not to add to the subsidy race and not to encourage over-investment in capacity or investment in the wrong sort of capacity when things are beginning to turn around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>640</span>
New orders by the industry last year were 66 per cent. higher than in 1987. There are signs that some sectors of the United Kingdom shipping industry—liner shipping for example—are investing and operating successfully. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has no doubt seen the good news from P & O Containers, P & O Bulk Shipping, Cunard and other companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 11 relates to the cap on investment under the business expansion scheme. For most types of company the limit is half a million pounds. We felt that that would exclude shipping from the scheme. It was in response to representations from the shipping industry that we made the concession of a £5 million limit. That is generous, and evidence shows that it operates well. In 1988–89 eight shipping companies launched BES share issues. A few years ago we should have found that rather surprising, but that shows that the scheme has had some impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury suggests an increase to £10 million, we must bear in mind what the impact of that would be on the overall BES. It would be out of line with the generality of investment and the half a million pound limit. It could distort the scheme further and could even be higher than the very large limit for assured tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's second new clause on BES is more precise and targeted. It relates to the length of time for which companies can engage in ship chartering. That is difficult to get right. In response to representations from the General Council of British Shipping, we made our concession. My hon. Friend knows that in general we do not like BES to be used for leasing operations and that is why we concentrated on, as my hon. Friend could rightly point out, the riskier end of the market—short-term chartering. We did that because longer-term chartering had the backing of an asset and an assured stream of income and is more predictable and able to raise finance. I know that that is debatable and that one could argue about extending the time a little beyond one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury related to the rolling over of balancing charges against future capital expenditure. That has surfaced before when discussing previous Finance Bills. The new wrinkle in new clause 13 this year is that there would be a three-year replacement period, which is one year shorter than that which was proposed in the almost identical new clause tabled last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is suggesting the reintroduction of accelarated depreciation. Although that could apply only to shipping, it goes against the thrust of the corporation tax reforms that we have introduced. In getting rid of accelerated depreciation and 100 per cent. first-year allowance and allowing 25 per cent. per annum depreciation, we have succeeded in making the tax write-off more closely aligned with commercial depreciation and in bringing down our corporation tax rate. That has been welcomed by industry and is very desirable because it encourages profitable companies and investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>641</span>
My hon. Friend said that I would make that point and that he, in return, would point out that in some countries the effective rate of company tax was less because of their allowances to shipping. That may be the case, but it depends on how profitable the industry is, a profitable industry's rate of company taxation will be less in this country than in other countries. That applies to some countries that have special allowances for shipping. That is how it should be. The company tax structure should encourage investment in profitable activity rather than in loss making or marginally profitable activity. Therefore, I put it to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury that it is in the interests of British industry and of the economy to have a corporation tax structure that is more geared towards encouraging profitable investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sceptical about whether balancing charges would have any significant effect on reversing the trend in the British fleet. Throughout the period 1975 to 1983, when we had much more generous first-year allowances—100 per cent. for the years 1975 to 1983—the fleet declined in size from 33 million gross registered tons to less than 11 million gross registered tons. Obviously there are other forces, and, as I have said, deeper forces were at work in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are certainly not indifferent to the British fleet; and as to my hon. Friend's important point about the defence aspect of the size of the merchant fleet, that is kept under review by the Ministry of Defence in consultation with us. On the capacity of our fleet and our ability to operate out of area, I am assured that the Ministry of Defence is satisfied that it would have sufficient merchant shipping to carry out any likely out-of-area operation. I assure my hon. Friend that that matter is and will be kept under review, and we are bearing in mind the recommendations and remarks of the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to adopt the measure recommended by my hon. Friend, particularly with regard to corporation tax, would go against the thrust of our corporation tax reforms. I cannot recommend that to the Committee. My hon. Friend says that special reasons apply to shipping, but I am told that special reasons apply to the chemical and film industries and to many other manufacturing industries. We are determined to stick to the structure of the reforms, but we shall keep under review the problem that my hon. Friend has identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is right to say that the enormous decline in world shipping in which we took part from 1975 onwards was not even dented by the then fiscal structure in this country. There was an unprecedented collapse in world shipping rates because of overcapacity. Ships had been built in the early 1970s in the expectation of an expansion that never happened, and we also had a great deal of flabbiness in our shipping industry. We are now in a different ballpark. We now have a much smaller number of leaner, fitter shipping companies struggling to compete in a market which, as my right hon. Friend rightly identified, is showing a few glimmers of light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening remarks, I share my right hon. Friend's commitment to the view that, as far as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>642</span>
possible, our corporation tax structure or company tax structure should have no bias towards investment or, indeed, investment in particular sectors. However, I should like to leave one simple point with him before I withdraw the motion. Whichever option we eventually choose, I firmly believe that the situation will continue to worsen unless we recognise what is happening in other countries. I wish my right hon. Friend had been with me when I visited Venezuela three years ago. We could have sat talking to the people who are setting up a merchant shipping industry there about all the clever approaches that their Government have for making certain that Venezuelan goods are carried on Venezuelan ships and repaired in a Venezuelan yard which happened to be a client of my company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad fact is that we are looking at the service equivalent of dumping. I know that the Government have taken a few modest measures, but I leave my right hon. Friend with the thought that at some stage we shall have to do more. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

You have given matters such as deep discount bonds and all the other esoteric ways of company finance the same undivided attention you will give to the issue that I now raise, which is very close to your heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each of the new clauses relates to maintenance funds for historic houses. For a long time, Mr. Cormack, you have played a considerable role in the House in giving the most trenchant support to this cause. One principle that has guided you, Mr. Cormack, as you have worked for the cause, has been that of ensuring that the maximum cross-party support be found and maintained for the preservation of historic homes and the tax regime which must exist to enable them to survive and thrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was once a Liberal. In those days, he supported a curious constitutional coexistence called the Lib-Lab pact. The rest of the House is much less generous about events that occurred then than the hon. Gentleman. However, the current regime, as it affects historic houses and maintenance funds, dates from days which the hon. Gentleman will wistfully and nostalgically recall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>644</span>
During the last Parliament, I recall an occasion in Committee, late at night, when I was moving various amendments and new clauses dealing with historic houses and maintenance funds. The Minister who replied—Lord Rees, as he now is—most generously told the Committee that he was minded to accept the amendment that I proposed. This came as something of a surprise to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a Division in the House at the time and during the Division, the principal Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Davis) approached me and said that the Opposition were against that rather minor amendment. As a result, even though Lord Rees had said that he was prepared to accept the amendment, I decided to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, when dealing with matters that affect not only generation and this age, but future generations and centuries, to have the widest possible support zacross party lines. Since you have known about the Historic Houses Association, Mr. Cormack, I know that you have urged that principle upon the association and that it has been followed—to the considerable advantage of the heritage of our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be relieved to know, Mr. Cormack, that one of the incidental consequences of the line taken by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on clause 167—I was absent at the time, for which I apologise—is that new clause 15, which relates to what might have happened if clause 167 were approved by the Committee, becomes unnecessary. Although I am prepared to talk, possibly at length, about new clauses 14 and 28, I shall not trouble the Committee by talking about new clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14 deals with additional rate tax and maintenance funds. Maintenance funds are treated as discretionary trusts for tax purposes. That means that the trustees of maintenance funds are liable to the additional rate of tax as well as to the basic rate—in other words, to some 35 per cent. at present. In no circumstances can the income of a maintenance fund be withdrawn for personal benefit. All the income must be accumulated or used for the preservation of the historic heritage property. The additional rate of tax on maintenance funds acts, in my submission, as a major disincentive to owners to set up such trusts. The time has come for it to be repealed. New clause 14 would bring about the repeal of that additional rate of tax and would ensure that the trusts are taxed only at the standard rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of a maintenance fund did not originally confer any income tax benefit. A maintenance fund trust is not a charity and its income is therefore chargeable in the normal way for trust property. Because the purpose of the trust is to maintain the house occupied by the settlor or his heir, it is inevitable that the income will be taxable as that of the settlor, as in part XV of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, or as that of his heir. The Committee will be fully aware of the leading case of Lady Miller and the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>645</span>
There is no general provision which allows a deduction from the income chargeable in respect of expenditure on the house itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 prevents the property from being transferred to a maintenance fund that exceeds the maintenance requirements of the heritage property. The requirements of the National Trust for endowments give a reasonable guidance about what would not be excessive. Bearing in mind that there is no substantial income tax relief for maintenance funds, there will be few estates large enough to produce net-of-tax income sufficient for National Trust criteria,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of all of this is to extend the number of maintenance funds in this country. It has been disappointing that although maintenance funds established with cross-party support and although that support has been maintained even in the circumstances that I rather eccentrically outlined a few moments ago, the number of take-ups for maintenance funds is still very low and much lower than the number which my right honourable Friend and his colleagues in the Treasury have declared to be in the public interest. Therefore we must do what we can to extend the tax regime that applies to maintenance funds. New clause 14 would make it that much easier by reducing the disincentive of the extra tax—the extra 10 per cent. that is chargeable on these maintenance funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 28—I know how closely you have studied the detail of this, Mr. Cormack but if it assists the Committee I am prepared to read out each and every word of the new clause that I am proposing—enables maintenance fund trustees to improve heritage property as regards public access, subject to certain safeguards. Public access is the quid pro quo on which Parliament insisted to enable the owners of historic houses to take advantage of the existing tax regime for maintenance funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new clause 28 is to enable the trustees to improve heritage property over and beyond what is currently allowed. My right honourable Friend the Financial Secretary will remember speaking on that matter during the passage of the Finance Bill last year, when my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) was kind enough to assume responsibility for these affairs during my temporary absence to serve on another Standing Committee. His effort on behalf of the Historic Houses Association was most impressive and widely admired. Alas, this year the old team has returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely wish to remind my right honourable Friend that he spoke on the matter last year, although he did not have the disadvantage of hearing me speak on the subject. He said that it was disappointing that more maintenance funds had not been established. The reason is that the regime is still not sufficiently attractive. The setting up for a maintenance fund puts considerable burdens of preservation and public access on the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers are tightly drawn and do not allow for any improvement to the property. Many historic houses depend on agricultural income for their survival and, with the decline in agricultural profits
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>646</span>
and rents, it is vital that other sources of income be developed to maintain historic houses. Such sources include the tourist and leisure industries, but they necessarily involve some improvement to the property. Maintenance fund trustees cannot undertake that expenditure at present and the purpose of new clause 28 is to enable them to carry out improvements that would generate more income for the preservation of the house. It would also introduce safeguards to prevent owners from benefiting and would ensure that the character of the property was not adversely affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that these principles commend themselves to your heart, Mr. Cormack, and, although you would not wish to be drawn into our discussion and prefer not to be put in the position of using your casting vote, I know that I have your unspoken support in moving the new clause because of your long and close personal interest in such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not be judged to be compromising your impartiality, Mr. Cormack, if I join the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) in paying tribute to your outstanding chairmanship of the all-party parliamentary heritage group. Its work is much valued by many members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ensuring the easy and sensible maintenance of historic houses is a matter on which we join hands across the Committee. The opposition approach the new clauses tabled by the hon. Member for Corby with sympathy for the over-all aim. The hon. Gentleman said that new clause 15 has been overtaken by events, so I shall confine my brief comments to new clauses 14 and 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see clearly what the hon. Member for Corby is trying to achieve in new clause 14 and I have some sympathy with it. However, I am worried that it might be possible for a trust to be deliberately established under the terms of new clause 14 to achieve the lower rate of tax. The use of the establishment of such a trust for the purposes of tax avoidance is not something that we should encourage, although ensuring that there is no fiscal disincentive to the proper maintenance of historic property should be an objective. We are worried about the precise mechanisms of new clause 14, while sympathising with its aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We give a readier welcome to new clause 28. It seeks to provide a maintenance fund that would enable improvements to be made to a property in addition to maintenance work being carried out. The Historic Houses Association has argued strongly that with proper safeguards in place, the ability to make improvements or additions to an historic house, so that the public may appreciate and enjoy it, should be provided by a maintenance fund, with the tax advantages that go with it. The Opposition support that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Historic Houses Association helped the hon. Member for Corby to draw up his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>647</span>
new clause, and it has tried hard to include safeguards in it. It refers to additional improvements which should
	<br><q><p>"generate additional income without in either case materially affecting its quality".</p></q>
That is an important provision, but I am worried that the wording would not necessarily guarantee the exact character of the property in all its respects. The new clause should perhaps be reworded to make it a tougher and tighter condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association has gone to considerable trouble to ensure that the improvements that are made should benefit the public, not the owner of the property, and that the benefit should not give an undue tax advantage if the property is subsequently sold on and its value increased by the improvements made. Both those provisos are essential. We should be grateful to hear the Government's assessment of whether the wording in the new clause provides those safeguards. We believe that it should be tightened up a little to ensure that the objective of the association and, I am sure, the hon. Gentleman is properly fulfilled. If the provisions are tightened up, and we are assured that the safeguards are in place, the Opposition would welcome the new clause. I hope that the Government will give it a fair wind, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The entire Committee is indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) for raising such important matters, and for expressing the all-party consensus that established a favourable tax climate for heritage and bingo. That is obviously the way in which advances are made. I note that my hon. Friend did not advance the argument of a level playing field—the only speaker this afternoon not to do so. However, he could hardly have done that when so many generous tax reliefs are available for heritage and historic houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must remind the Committee of the existing generous tax reliefs. I do not wish to embarrass you, Mr. Cormack, as, over the years, you have played a part in establishing those special and justifiable tax reliefs. As my hon. Friends know, special inheritance tax treatment is given to assets put into maintenance funds. There are specific income tax provisions for assisting maintenance funds. Conditional exemption from inheritance tax and capital gains tax may be claimed on transfers of heritage property of the appropriate quality. There is an absolute exemption from inheritance tax and capital gains tax for gifts and bequests to certain heritage organisations. Over the years, Governments have recognised the importance of historic houses and the difficulty in maintaining and keeping them in good condition, which is why there are so many reliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Corby about the desirability of encouraging maintenance funds. At present, there are 63 such funds and a further 55 are being established, making a total of 118. That is not an insignificant amount, but I agree with my hon. Friend that we should encourage further the use of maintenance funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 14 aims to exclude heritage maintenance funds from the charge to income tax at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>648</span>
the additional rate, which applies to discretionary trusts generally. At present, the income of maintenance funds is taxed at 35 per cent.—the sum of the basic rate and the additional rate of 10 per cent. The capital gains of maintenance funds are taxed also at 35 per cent., and the new clause would indirectly abolish that charge, too. The new clause would also make several consequential changes to the way in which the charge operates if the property were used for non-heritage purposes. However, that is not an important part of the new provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult to exempt maintenance funds from the additional rate. First, the trustees of a maintenance fund have power to accumulate the income or to use it for specified heritage purposes at their discretion. I see no reason why such funds should generally be treated for income tax and capital gains tax purposes in a different way from other discretionary and accumulation trusts. Although the maintenance fund is dedicated to the maintenance of the property, the settlor and his family will benefit from that indirectly as there will be that much less need for them to find funds to maintain the property out of their personal income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, maintenance funds already have an advantage. In cases when the trust income would otherwise be treated as the settlor's and taxed at his personal rate—often at 40 per cent.—he has the option of electing to be taxed at 35 per cent. instead. There is an advantage there and it would be difficult to justify further special treatment for maintenance funds without facing pressure for similar treatment from other types of discretionary trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the present arrangements probably strike the right balance. The very generous inheritance tax reliefs for maintenance funds recognise the special problems which an occasional large capital tax liability could pose. Although I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby, I discussed the new clause with the Historic Houses Association in the past and I cannot recommend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby said that he felt that his second new clause may have fallen because of the decisions that we made in the Committee the other day. His third new clause is one with which I have some sympathy though I believe that it requires further study. My hon. Friend suggest that we should allow endowment property to be used for improvement of the heritage property itself, once the six-year period for which the maintenance fund has to run has expired, without payment of the tax clawback charge that might otherwise apply. I understand these would include improvements or developments that would generate additional income for the owner of the heritage property, who may or may not be the same as the person who created the endowment. Acceptance of the proposal would represent a significant extension of the scope of the present relief. To allow endowment property to be used for income generating projects would mean a departure from the existing principle of limiting expenditure to that designed to facilitate the maintenance and preservation of the qualifying heritage property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>649</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby has, of course, been careful to build some safeguards into his new clause. In particular, he rules out extravagant money-raising schemes that would materially affect the quality of the heritage property. Perhaps he was influenced by the recent cartoon in 	<i>Private Eye</i> which seemed to anticipate my hon. Friend's amendment. The caption read
	<br><q><p>"I understand there are plans to knock down the castle and extend the gift shop."</p></q>
I am sure that that is not what my hon. Friend had in mind and he has proposed safeguards. His new clause also enshrines the idea that the profit, after payment of the "fair return" to the trustees, is apparently to go to the heritage property owner for his own unrestricted use. So the proposal would open the way for heritage owners to use their maintenance funds to obtain total exemption from inheritance tax for commercial activities undertaken in the name of preserving their properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certainly interested in the proposal put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Corby, but I have a number of doubts about it. I do not want to encourage over-investment in too many commercial projects but we have been discussing this idea with the Historic Houses Association. We have not come to a conclusion on those discussions, and although I am favourably disposed to what my hon. Friend said I believe that the best way forward would be for those discussions to continue so that we may see whether the law needs amending. It is possible that some of the objectives can be achieved under existing law but if it needs amending we would certainly consider doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Member for Corby would seek leave to withdraw his new clause I assure him that we are sympathetically disposed to his proposal and if we can find a way forward we shall certainly continue discussions with the Historic Houses Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has given a full reply to my two new clauses. His remarks will be studied carefully by those involved in heritage and in the Historic Houses Association. His advice to withdraw the motion while discussions continue is sound. The HHA will wish to take up my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause makes a number of changes to the business expansion scheme. It is hoped that they will offset the reductions in the traditional business expansion schemes that have resulted from a large proportion of available investment being diverted into assured tenancy schemes. I understand that in the past year, out of £350 million, £320 million has gone into such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first proposal is to increase from £0.5 million to £0.75 million the limit on what eligible companies can raise under a BES. The industry feels that £0.75 million is still too low, but I have suggested that figure as it is more likely to be acceptable to my right hon. Friend the Minister and the Revenue. I believe that on last year's Finance Bill my right hon. Friend suggested that he would be sympathetic to an increase in the limit in this year's Bill. Will he open his heart now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish, secondly, to reduce from five to three years the time in which individual BES shareholders are locked into their companies. The proposal would release existing money, which could then be invested in new schemes, and would also solve the problems of successful BES companies that are finding it difficult to raise more traditional follow-on finance while they still have BES shareholders locked in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original limit was, I think, designed to compensate for the tax relief, but because of the success of the Government's policies in reducing tax levels—particularly at the higher end—the tax relief has been substantially reduced. We welcome such changes, but it seems reasonable to reduce the time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we seek to make investment in small workshops available through the scheme in the same way as assured tenancies. That could be a method of making available funds for small businesses. Despite the success of the Government's policies, there is throughout the country a real shortage of suitable small workshops. As many of the BES funds are now being channelled into property schemes, we feel that a small workshop scheme might also appeal to investors and help the Government's overall policy on small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we propose that those who invest in BES companies who have the expertise and who are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>652</span>
willing to give time and advice, should be able to receive fees to a maximum of £5,000 in any 12 months. That could be of great benefit to new companies. Currently, some of those people whose time is valuable may not be willing to give it because they are not reimbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary may find that the drafting of our rather long new clause is defective. I am no parliamentary draftsman, but I hope that some of the suggestions that I put forward as chairman of the small business Back Bench committee might be welcome, and that he might be able to consider them on report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having approached the previous new clauses in a bipartisan spirit, I fear that I am unable to give such a warm welcome to new clause 17. One section of it is worthy of some consideration, but the new clause does several things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seeks to increase the overall amount for individual business expansion scheme funds that are not applied to shipping or to private rented housing, from £500,000 to £750,000. If that provision were specifically directed at those enterprise sectors normally described as manufacturing industry—we ourselves promoted a new clause to that effect last year—we would see it as an argument for an increase in the limit. As members of the Committee know, we have considerable doubts about the effectiveness of BES as a means of raising risk equity capital. There are better ways of promoting small scale enterprise than the business expansion scheme. But as we have the beast before us, we might as well try to make it work. One way of doing so would be to encourage it more into manufacturing industry, in which BES has fallen dramatically. We might have supported a specific raising of the limit, but not a general raising of the limit, from £500,000 to £750,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the reduction from five years to three years. The intention of the BES has always been to ensure that the funds are made to work for a sustained period before the advantages under capital gains tax relief can be enjoyed at the end of the five year period. The proposed reduction begins to breach that principle of sustained investment over a substantial period. We do not support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major purpose of the new clause is to introduce BES relief for the provision of small workshops. We have greater sympathy with that part of the new clause. We are surprised and pleased to see an essential aspect of the promotion of small scale enterprise—the provision of workshop space—being promoted by Conservative Members. However, part of their definition gives me considerable cause for concern. Under the heading, "Buildings to which section 50A applies", paragraph (a) relates to the provision of a building to be used
	<br><q><p>"as an office or offices".</p></q>
That part of the definition seems to negate much of the purpose of encouraging the provision of small workshops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take as an analogy what has happened with the redefinition of planning categories in inner-city
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>653</span>
areas in the past year or 18 months. Because class B1 planning use, which used to be for small workshop and craft usage, has been redefined to include the provision of office accommodation, the inevitable has happened: a great amount of space—especially in areas such as my constituency—which in the past was used as workshop space by small crafts people, has become office space, with much higher rents being charged. The result is that many small enterprises have effectively been driven out of inner-city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that there will be the same effect if the definition of small workshops in the new clause is not amended. I hope that its supporters will reconsider the definition carefully because it becomes all-important in considering the ultimate use of the space provided through the business expansion scheme funds that are being proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We strongly oppose parts of the new clause. We have some sympathy with others. We would consider sympathetically the establishment of more workshops through the BES, imperfect though its mechanism is. Although the Government will reject parts of new clause 17, we hope that they will look favourably at the intention behind the proposal of the hon. Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support new clause 17. I found much of interest in the speech of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I am pleased in a way that he did not go further in support of our new clause because that might have damaged my reputation among my colleagues for usually being at the opposite end of the spectrum from him. Opposition Members appear to be moving more towards current Conservative Government thinking on helping small businesses, which has gone in that direction for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest. Not only am I involved in small businesses, and something of a supporter of them, but I am involved in business expansion scheme promotion and have been involved—and remain so to an extent—in the management of two BES funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This aspect of the BES, to which the main part of the new clause relates, deserves support. We should reflect upon what the scheme has achieved. Many companies would not have been started without it. Many companies in the portfolio in whose management I have been involved would not be in business today without the business expansion scheme. In particular, the BES has helped new companies with young management. Many people involved in business management in the companies with which I deal are in their 30s, while some are in their 20s. They could not have obtained backing for their companies without the benefits of the BES, under which those providing backing can get tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax relief has been extremely worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the BES some 2,000 companies have obtained tax relief and benefits and more than 20,000 direct jobs have started. I know of many such jobs and many indirect jobs have followed on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>654</span>
The accounts of some of the companies in which I am involved show that after three or four years, the BES has been a net gainer of income to the Inland Revenue. The Revenue's early reservations proved totally unfounded. I know of examples where the amount of VAT, corporation tax and national insurance raised now exceeds the tax relief originally given under the BES.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BES has been a net benefit to the Treasury and a definite success, but now funds have dried up. An exception, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) said, is rented housing in the private sector under the new proposals. There are also funds available in shipping and in one or two other schemes, but there has been a considerable reduction in the amount of money available for small individual companies, be they in manufacturing, trading or property development, which has not received a tremendous following. I have been involved in property development companies and some have created worthwhile office and business space. Much employment has resulted, and it has helped the expansion of the economy during the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies and financial sponsors face considerable difficulties on prospectus issues. The costs involved in legal and professional fees and taxation are great. They can amount to £50,000 or £75,000 even when low fee rates have been negotiated with professional advisers. The high costs make a prospectus issue that raises only £500,000 economically unviable and terribly inefficient as a means of raising capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will give serious thought to increasing the amount of money that can be raised in any one tax year from £500,000 to £750,000. Our figure of £750,000 is modest in relation to the sum that we should seek, which is £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago I was worried that money went only to big ventures. Now, given the problems of starting a business in high tech or in manufacturing, to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred, it is impossible to start a business with proper plant and machinery and with the technology required today unless there is a decent amount of starting capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another disadvantage of having too low a figure is the end out for the investor. An investor invests in a business only if he ultimately has an opportunity of realising his investment. He may not choose to take it. He may back the business for many years, but no one backs a business from its beginning unless there is the possibility of an eventual out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Marketability will not be achieved unless businesses are a reasonable size. I suggest that a business which starts with £500,000 capital, and which may in its early stages incur immense costs in professional fees and so on while raising that capital, cannot grow to a decent size. A business that starts with £750,000 capital has the opportunity to get on to the unlisted securities market of the stock exchange or even of having its shares quoted on the full listing of the stock exchange after three or five years.

I hope that the Minister will give the proposal serious consideration. Last year I managed to get a nod and a wink out of him, which was noted by Opposition Members. Unfortunately nods and winks do not appear in 	<i>Hansard.</i> This year I wish to press the Minister to make a stronger commitment than a nod and a wink. Indeed, I hope that this year he will give me a full, frank, unequivocal, complete and total commitment that he will review the limit during the coming year. I hope that he will not only review the limit of £500,000 to £750,000, but take no notice of the Opposition's observation about five years not being reduced to three years.

We need five years, because the rewards from the business expansion scheme are not as great as they used to be. Tax relief is down from 75 per cent. and 60 per cent. to 40 per cent., and that has an effect on the rate of return. If there is to be an investigation of the current situation, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will look carefully, and ensure that professional accountants look carefully, into the rate of return and the effect that it has had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I know that small workshops will command considerable support, the only observation that I shall make on directors' fees is that there are many people who would like to invest in and help small companies in their early stages in a way that has not been possible up to now. Such people wish to offer genuine support. They may not be consultants practised in consultancy; they may not be able to offer consultancy services. Nevertheless, they may be able to offer general business advice and services, and because they are not established in the field, they cannot receive tax relief and a fee of up to £5,000. If people provide genuine business services, advice, help or even work, they should be able to obtain tax relief as well as a modest fee of up to £5,000 for that contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will accept that this is an extremely modest new clause. I hope, too, that he will not heed the reservations of the Opposition, who do not have sufficient sympathy for the plight of small businesses, which still need further assistance despite all the wonderful achievements of this Government. Even if my right hon. Friend cannot give an absolute assurance that our proposals can be accepted tonight or in the coming few weeks, I hope that he can tell us that they will be considered seriously, that reports will be studied in the course of the next year, and that we may have grounds for hope in next year's Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Honourable Members may recall that on Second Reading I asked the Financial Secretary for a full monitoring report on the business expansion scheme. When Conservative Members call for full, frank and on-the-record support for BES, we surely need a full, frank and on-the-record assessment, because I am not prepared to agree that the scheme has been a success if there is no means of assessing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>656</span>
whether it has been. In my own area, for example, I do not know how the resources have been spent, because there is no proper public accountability, and as the scheme involves tax relief and is part of the tax system and public funding, there should be proper accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the part of the new clause that proposes a shift in the direction of small businesses, and I draw a small parallel. In Leeds—and, I am sure, in other inner-city areas—we have attempted for some years to use the urban development programme to build small premises where only large premises had been available, when people wanted start-up premises instead of renting huge spaces that they could not afford. We have also used the urban programme money for grants to small businesses and co-operatives. In each case, the Department of the Environment insists that it and the local authority see the business plan of the company. An annual report is then made by the local authority covering every penny spent under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same happens with the urban development grant schemes. Some of them are much larger than the urban programme schemes. Companies go into housing schemes that cost millions of pounds, but they are accountable. I shall be surprised if Ministers tell me that confidentiality is the reason why there cannot be a report and full assessment of the operation of the business expansion scheme. I refer them to urban development grant and urban programme schemes. Details are given about companies and individuals, and about the precise amounts of money received as help in getting a venture or a business off the ground or, indeed, in continuing it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this matter. In Scotland local authorities and the Scottish Office have expressed sympathy with the use of urban programme money for economic development. Is my hon. Friend aware that the Department of the Environment in England and Wales does not take the same sympathetic attitude? That prevents business development similar to that in Scotland—especially the community business kind—in deprived areas of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are waking up to what is happening late in the day. Some local authorities in Scotland, and in England and Wales, have been actively engaged in local economic development for nearly 10 years. This Government saw fit, during the passage of the Local Government and Housing Bill this year, to introduce the welcomed new power for economic development. The Government are moving rather late in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as the amendment proposes, resources are geared towards small firms and premises and startup businesses, there should be clear accountability. There is no reason why there should not be a regular monitoring report, delivered annually or every three years, on how the resources are used. If there is no report, the businesses could become an unaccountable excuse. That is not the way to spend

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>657</span>
public money. There are reports on other forms of assistance in inner-city areas and on general economic development and we should insist that there is at least an on-the-record report on how these resources are used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop that point further. When public money is used for economic development, it needs to be compared with its other uses to discover whether it is an efficient way of stimulating economic development. In the past few years, less and less Government attention has been given to regional policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of money has become more discretionary and there has been a redistribution of Government resources to the south-east, away from the north-east, Scotland and other areas. The proposers of the new clause hinted that the business expansion scheme is operating to stimulate development in areas where it is not needed as much as other kinds of development. The regional imbalance between the south-east and the rest of the country has accelerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that public money for stimulating economic development is given to areas that need it most. When I intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) I was trying to emphasise that one of the good things that the Scottish Office has done is to acknowledge that the urban programme is a good way of allowing local authorities and local people through community businesses, with which I have been involved for years, to stimulate economic development. It was extremely interesting that when prizes were given on television for the stimulation of local economies, the first prize for economic development went to Govan Workspace. Local people took over an old school, converted it into work shops and stimulated extra jobs. They went on to take over the old Elderpark bakery and several hundred jobs were created for local people. That enterprise now works fully economically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to acknowledge the role played by the Scottish Office in allowing urban aid, and the cooperative attitude of Strathclyde regional council, without which the programme would not exist in England. Public money was sympathetically put to valuable use to stimulate jobs precisely where they were needed, and to use the skills of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have been trying to get a commitment from the Financial Secretary to provide a full assessment of the business expansion scheme. We accept that some activities such as assured tenancies, have been stimulated by the scheme but one doubts whether stimulating economic recovery throughout the country is the number one priority. What commitment will the Financial Secretary give to providing a full assessment of the BES, to let us assess whether that is the best way to use public money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) and for Dover (Mr. Shaw) put forward a four-barrelled and rather an ingenious new clause designed to change significant parts of the business expansion scheme. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>658</span>
would not reject them all, but I made it clear on the Floor of the House that we had decided, after all the major changes made to the BES last year, that this was the year to let things settle down to see how the scheme developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) that we do not rule out reviewing the BES. However, we shall not give a yearly report to Parliament of the type which the hon. Member for Leeds, West suggested. In one sense, we review the scheme every year, which is precisely why we imposed the limit of £500,000. We made a policy decision that too many of the scheme's resources were going to medium-sized business in which the additionality was not so evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not rule out commissioning a study similar to the Peat Marwick report of four years after the original business start-up scheme, which was two years after the BES itself. Having made so many changes to the scheme last year, it is too early to commission another report. I was astonished when the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie made his assessment of the impact on assured tenancies. That scheme has been going for only a year and we need a little more time to judge its effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall keep the BES under review—the decisions we have taken show that we do—and we may undertake a fuller study similar to that made in 1985. There would be nothing wrong in doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Will the information contained in that study be for the Minister himself or will it be made public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, I am sure unwittingly, distorting what I said. I did not give a commitment to undertake that study and I shall certainly not give a commitment to make any such study public because that is to leap ahead. However, I see no argument against such a study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four points were raised in the new clause. The first, and most important, was raising the limit from £500,000 pounds to £750,000. The reduction did not go down well with all the business expansion industry, but we felt that the scheme needed to be better targeted. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Dover, who urged us to make that reduction because he genuinely wanted to encourage mini-business, the small business and the start-up business. He wanted to get closer to the original purpose of the start-up scheme, which became the business expansion scheme, and to encourage new businesses. That is why we decided to impose the limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The signs are that the scheme is working satisfactorily. The amount raised from the public to go into BES companies that seek less than £500,000 is higher than it was two years ago, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dover says, the total amount raised, exclusive of assured tenancies, is less. That is hardly surprising; it would be astonishing if it were not so. We must also consider the cost of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>659</span>
prospectuses and legal fees. My hon. Friend has a special interest in funds, but the new clause may make funding more difficult. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) also has an interest in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover asked me for an assurance that we would review the limit during the coming year. I give him that assurance because he has made some good points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not so persuaded by the second barrel of the four-barrel gun. Under the present rules, to qualify for the BES reliefs, an investor must not be connected with the company that he invests in and he must keep his money in a BES company for a minimum of five years after the share issue. Paragraph (b) would reduce that period from five years to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions are important. We consider that the generous BES reliefs are not necessary for investors connected with the company; they are likely to want to invest anyway. Without a time limit on withdrawal, an investor could withdraw his money shortly after making his investment and still receive tax relief. To reduce the five-year period to three years would have undesirable consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To qualify for the scheme, a company must carry on a qualifying trade for a minimum of three years. If the scheme is to be effective, the money raised by BES companies should be actively used in a trade for at least three years, but a company does not have to begin trading until up to two years after the date of issuing shares. That is to allow start-up companies time to prepare for carrying on a trade after they have raised the finance. So a company's qualifying period may end five years after the shares were issued. If we were to reduce the five-year period to three years, it would be possible for a shareholder to become connected with a company during the company's qualifying trading period and still get BES relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have over-complicated my hon. Friend's intention—he may not have intended that double effect. Furthermore, a shareholder could realise his investment after the company had been trading for as little as one year. That is not desirable. We want the investor to stay with the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the tax rate has been reduced from the higher rates to 40 per cent, the benefit of the tax relief is less. If small companies invest in shares on the stock market, they can sometimes get a higher rate of return from a moderately successful BES investment over a three-year period. We are concerned that there is not so great an incentive to invest in the BES company as there is in the stock market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with that. My hon. Friend is saying that the cut in tax rates has made other investment opportunitites more attractive and, therefore, that we should increase the tax subsidy to keep the playing field level. I cannot accept that argument. The reduction in tax rates not only makes other investment opportunities more attractive but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>660</span>
it means that the investor has more of his own money to put in the BES company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of new clause 17, emphasised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington, relates to small workshops, which are defined as those with less than 2,500 sq ft. Such companies are likely to be excluded from BES because of the proportion of their assets in land and buildings and they would also be caught by the exclusion of companies that lease assets. We should consider that in the context of what now BES would be affected. There is an argument for investing in small workshops; there are problems in inner city and rural areas, but the last survey that we carried out showed that they are not universal. There has already been a large diversion of funds because of the inclusion of assured tenancies in the BES and we would have to consider how any measure to subsidise small workshops might affect the scheme. In general, with the exception of assured tenancies, we have tried to get away from encouraging asset-backed investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 3 of new clause 17 deals with directors' fees. Directors who are paid less than £5,000 a year by a company would be allowed BES relief on any investment in that company. All employers and paid directors of the company are prohibited from getting relief on any investment they make in the company they work for. Reliefs are generous because they are intended to encourage investment by outsiders. People who work for a company already have an incentive to invest in it, so it is doubtful whether the proposal would be a cost-effective form of tax relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of that part of the new clause may have been misconceived. An example of what the new clause aims to achieve arises when a husband wishes to invest in a BES company and his wife wishes to have the opportunity to work. If the wife is not a business consultant or accountant and receives no income from being one, she would not be able to receive remuneration. She may not have had experience of work before, and may become involved in helpful work. In one example in which I am involved, the wife and husband do not need remuneration because of their financial position, but the present law discourages people who might need remuneration because they may not be so well endowed financially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My argument would still apply in my hon. Friend's case. My hon. Friend interrupted me when I was about to say that I might change my mind, that we could review the matter and that the arguments were not all one sided, given that we were talking about a modest remuneration. We shall review the £500,000, but I have strong doubts about reducing the five years to three years. We can review the other measures, but without a commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We tabled the new clause as a marker for next year. In view of the reply of my right hon.

	<div class='title'>WRITING DOWN ALLOWANCES FOR PIG HOUSES.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"In Schedule 15 of the Finance Act 1986 (which provides for a writing-down period of twenty-five years on allowances for agricultural land and buildings), there shall be inserted in paragraph 1(1), after 'twenty-five years', 'or ten years in respect of pig houses'."—[	<i>Mr. John Townend</i>].</p>

	<br><q><p>"In Schedule 15 of the Finance Act 1986 (which provides for a writing-down period of twenty-five years on allowances for agricultural land and buildings), there shall be inserted in paragraph 1(1), after 'twenty-five years', 'or ten years in respect of buildings and for intensive poultry production'."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These new clauses reduce the writing-down period for pig and poultry buildings from 25 to 10 years. I have never supported excessive wear and tear allowances and I strongly supported the Government's abolition of the 100 per cent. first year allowance as part of their corporation tax reform. The Revenue should base allowable depreciation for tax purposes on what a prudent businessman or accountant would write off in his financial accounts. No reasonable, prudent person would write off 4 per cent. on pig and poultry houses. If he did, the assets in his balance sheet would be grossly overvalued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the present system was introduced in the Finance Act 1986, all agricultural buildings could be written off against tax over 10 years. After 1978 there was an issue allowance of 20 per cent. It was sensible for the Government to alter that and bring agricultural buildings into line with industrial buildings. Huts and barns of stout construction can easily last for 25 years and it is not unreasonable that they should be written off in the same way as a permanent factory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a difference with pig and poultry buildings. They are generally wooden and are designed for a much shorter life. Many of these specialist buildings are marketed as having a life of only 10 to 12 years. They are supplied, as an integral part of the building, with whirring equipment—for ventilation, for example—which wears out easily in 10 years. They are subject to legislation and particularly to welfare requirements that may require substantial changes to allowable building design much more often than every 25 years. Experience of past years shows significant changes to the regulations every seven to 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pig and poultry industries are developing rapidly and a writing-off period of 10 years would encourage them to re-invest. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will not use the old chestnut of saying that it does not really matter because if the buildings fall down in five years time, there will be a balancing allowance. If he uses that argument, he may as well say that there should be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>662</span>
only a 4 per cent. writing-down allowance for plant and machinery, on the basis that if the plant and machinery wears out in less than 25 years, there is a balancing allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses are sound and are based on prudent accounting and business principles. This anomaly should be put right. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's new clause, having received representations from the Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Rutland counties branch of the National Farmers Union. I always pay attention to that organisation because I have the honour of having been its chairman in 1983. At the same time, I must make it clear to the Committee that I have at no material stage, certainly in my adult life, been involved in pig keeping. I would simply mention two points in support of my hon. Friend which the NFU has put very strongly to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point relates to the importance of certainty in advance of investment. As I understand it—perhaps my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will amplify this—there is a fallback possibility, if a building falls down or is scrapped, of calculating a balancing charge—but not in advance. It is not clear exactly what is to happen; the position is to some extent precarious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I should share the second point—about weaner vans—with the Committee because it was new to me. Indeed, I had to ask my lobbyist to explain the concept of weaner vans to me. Weaners are pigs that have been weaned and are being taken on to fatten; vans are as in "caravans". It so happens that the options for modern pig production are either to instal buildings of the type to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington has referred—which have a notoriously and typically short life—or to instal weaner vans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Weaner vans are largely metal, mobile objects and are treated as plant and machinery—which in itself is anomalous. Further, however, they tend to operate in tiers so that the pigs are stacked on top of one another. That may well attract the attention of the farm animal welfare Committee in the near future and eventually be discontinued. Until then, it seems anomalous and unfortunate that the less welfare—friendly practice is treated as plant and machinery and the best practice is subject to an unreasonably restrictive tax allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons, I support my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following our excellent debates on bingo duty, we now have before us a series of pleas to the Financial Secretary for advantageous tax treatment of specialist interest groups. Conservative Back Benchers' as a Committee we are examining each of the specialist interest on their merits, and in making such an examination we must, as the Financial Secretary said, consider the sorts of subsidies that are already available to different industrial sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>663</span>
It will not have escaped your notice, Mr. Cormack, or that of other Committee Members, that the agricultural industry in this country is not particularly hard done by when it comes to subsidies. As a whole, it receives more subsidies than any other sector of industry. Labour Members have had to watch employment in the shipbuilding, steel and coal industries—and in the communities that rely upon those industries—fall because the Government refuse to give them aid and support, and we look askance at the special pleading from the agricultural industry. The communities that are supported by that industry tend to return Conservative Members of Parliament, whereas steel, coal and shipbuilding communities return Labour Members of Parliament. There is a strong lobby on behalf of the agricultural industry among Conservative Back Benchers, and these propositions are clearly motivated and supported by that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of the proposition it is said that the buildings—the pig sties and chicken coops—will not last the 25-year period which is the average period that industrial and agricultural buildings are presumed to last, for the purposes of tax treatment. The hon. Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend), who moved the new clauses, said—quite fairly—that he felt that it was right, on balance, to bring the treatment of agricultural buildings into line with that of industrial buildings. He said that that was sensible, but that the buildings referred to in the new clause were anomalies. Any scheme that has as its yardstick the average treatment of buildings will have anomalies. Averaging out the lifespan of a building will disadvantage those that can be shown to last for a shorter time. Of course, many buildings will last for substantially longer periods, and the hon. Member for Bridlington has not suggested how they should be treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are against the hon. Gentleman's proposition because an average time span is involved and because of the evidence of our eyes. I grew up in a rural community in the heart of Kent where poultry farming was carried out extensively—it probably still is—and the buildings used for it have lasted substantially longer than 10 years. I can remember the same building being in place for at least 16 years—in all likelihood it is still there, propped up and decrepit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the letter circulated to most members of the Committee, the National Farmers Union argues that technological change means that a shorter time period is needed. That is an argument that any industry can advance—it is not unique to farming or the National Farmers Union. No case has been made as to why the argument should apply exclusively to agriculture and, in particular, to poultry and pig breeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason for looking somewhat askance at giving special extended tax reliefs to this industrial sector concerns the way that animals are treated. There has been widespread disquiet about the battery farming of chickens and the intensive farming of poultry. I took the point of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) about the tax treatment of weaner vans, which are used for stacking pigs on top
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>664</span>
of each other. That is not a pleasant way to treat animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us have been perturbed to read about the practices of some keepers in feeding battery chickens. Chopping up and recycling dead chickens as foodstuffs for live ones is pretty revolting to read about over the breakfast table. In addition to torturing the animals, the effects of such a practice may poison consumers of the products. That is not the sort of information to put before a Committee considering further tax concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are considering giving yet further tax reliefs to their friends in the NFU, they should consider the farmers who treat their animals kindly and do not use intensive farming methods. Tax relief should be available for farmers who take care of the product that they offer the consumer, not those who farm animals intensively for the least possible cost and the greatest financial gain. There may be a case for further reliefs in this area, but it is not made in this proposal or by those who indulge in intensive farming and who treat their animals in a way that many people deplore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend) seeks to reduce the writing-down period generally applicable to buildings and works that qualify for the agricultural buildings allowance from 25 years to 10, but only in respect of pig houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg my hon. Friend's pardon. I have two identical speeches here. One has the word "pig" and the other "poultry". I shall try to ad lib and say both. The new clause would increase the basic rate of allowance from 4 per cent. per annum to 10 per cent. for one class of agricultural building. As my hon. Friend knows, the system of agricultural building allowances was completely restructed in 1986 when corporation tax was reformed, to create a more neutral system with lower rates of tax. Under the new system, the writing-down period has been brought into line with the 25-year period that applies to industrial buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases we are talking about rather insubstantial structures and some people might quite legitimately question why they should get the 25-year 4 per cent. per annum allowance. A feature of the new arrangement was the introduction to the agricultural buildings allowance for the first time of a system of balancing adjustments. My hon. Friend referred to the balancing adjustments as an old chestnut but it was first made available in 1986. As my hon. Friend well understands, it means that the taxpayer has an option when the building is demolished, destroyed or sold. That option is of value. If, as my hon. Friend suggested, a pig house falls down after five years, the taxpayer can elect to receive the balancing allowance and can put that against his tax. When describing that as an old chestnut, my hon. Friend asked why, if it was so valuable, we do not depreciate machinery at 4 per cent. per annum over five years. That is not a valid comparison. Plant and machinery get a 25

per cent. writing-down allowance so that 90 per cent. of it is written off after eight years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An agricultural buildings allowance of 4 per cent. is generous for building as a whole. As there is also the facility of the balancing charge, it is certainly quite generous and certainly appropriate. It would be extremely difficult to specify, as is perhaps being hinted, different timetables for different agricultural buildings. My hon. Friend should not underestimate the generosity and usefulness of the balancing charge.

My hon. Friend for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) touched upon the mystery of weaner vans. I have no information about them, but I got the general thrust of his argument. It is, of course, argued that some buildings are so specialised that they ought to be classified as plant rather than agricultural buildings so that they can qualify for capital allowances at the machinery or plant rate of 25 per cent. of the reducing balance. Many structures that are used in pig farming qualify in that respect. The new clause does not go so far as to give the 25 per cent. rate for everything, but it would have a far-reaching effect for pig houses, by substituting a 10 year writing-down period for the present 25-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no statutory definition of plant and machinery for capital allowance purposes. What is or is not machinery gives rise to little difficulty; but there is difficulty in drawing the line over plant. A considerable body of case law provides guidance as to what may be plant but, at the day's end, whether a particular asset is regarded as a building or as an item of plant is very much a question of fact and degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that respect, it is worth noting that certain types of structure already qualify as "plant". They include semi-portable units, pig boxes, farrowing huts and dry sow huts and, for all I know, weaner vans. I shall certainly look into the case raised by my hon. Friend and will write to him about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases where machinery or plant allowances are not available to cover the cost of putting up the actual fabric of a building, any part of the building that clearly represents machinery or plant—for example, heating systems, mechanical pumps, movable pens or cages—also qualify for machinery or plant

allowances in the usual way. To that extent, the purpose of the new clause may be partially met.

I regret that I cannot go along with the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington. I shall study what he said to see whether I have missed any point. These matters are kept under review, but I should have great difficulty in recommending my hon. Friend's new clause to the Committee. Some parts of pig accommodation may qualify for the 25 per cent. allowance, depending precisely on what the equipment is and the plant that is in there. It is difficult to draw a definition, but I know from my limited experience of agriculture that quite substantial parts of the plant used in pig farming often qualify for the 25 per cent. allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is sceptical about the argument that I deployed on balancing charges, but there are arguments for saying that the treatment of buildings is quite generous and a balancing charge on a short lived-in asset may be useful. I shall study what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) is concerned, the last thing that I would advocate is a subsidy. I have taken a lot of flak in my constituency for being against subsidies. I consider the matter to be a fair writing-down allowance of any prudent person. In view of what the Minister said, I am disappointed. It is clear that there is not much support in the Committee for my point of view. However, the speech of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East will do me a power of good in my constituency, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
