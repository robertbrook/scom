I should like to remind hon. Members of the position over amendments that are handed in during the recess. Under Standing Order No. 62, amendments handed in during a recess not later than 4.30 pm on the last day are accepted as if the House were sitting that day. So any amendment handed in during the recess next week or on Monday 5 June will appear starred at our sitting on Tuesday 6 June. I further remind hon. Members of what I said on a previous occasion about starred amendments. When they were accepted last time it was exceptional and normally I do not propose to accept them in the future. Will hon. Members please bear that in mind? If there are points that hon. Members wish to raise with the Clerk when the Committee is suspended for dinner, he would be happy to advise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we proceed to our first group of amendments, I have been notified that the Opposition do not wish to move amendments Nos. 206 and 207, which are the first amendments listed on the amendment paper. Furthermore, I have accepted the request that under the group of amendments headed by amendment No. 211, should be included not only amendment Nos. 212 and 213 but amendments Nos. 214, 215, 219, 216 to 218, 220 and 221. It is a very large group. We are effectively grouping the list headed by amendment 211 with the lists headed by amendments Nos. 214 and 216. I am advised that that is acceptable to both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ELIGIBLE CONTRACTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Major)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 41, line 26, leave out from "and" to end of line 28 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"being either a national of a member State or a company or partnership formed under the law of any part of the United Kingdom or another member State and having its registered office, central administration or principal place of business in a member State.".</p></blockquote>
This is essentially a technical amendment, which corrects the drafting of clause 52(8)(b). Its effect is slightly to restrict the definition of "qualifying insurer" to what has originally been intended. Our intention is that tax relief will be available only on eligible contracts of private medical insurance that are issued by qualifying insurers. That includes all insurers lawfully carrying on medical insurance business in the United Kingdom, but it also includes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
insurers of European Community countries who are not carrying on business in the United Kingdom by virtue of establishing a branch here but who nevertheless wish to sell tax-relieved medical insurance contracts here. It is of the essence of the freedom of markets within the EC that they must be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as drafted at present would go rather beyond that. It would also allow non-EC insurance companies whose only presence in Europe is a branch in another EC country to offer tax-relieved contracts. That goes well beyond what the Government intended and well beyond the requirement of the European Community non-life insurance services directive. The amendment therefore limits the relief to contracts issued by insurers lawfully carrying on business in the United Kingdom and genuine European Community insurers with no formal presence in the United Kingdom. I hope that hon. Members can accept the amendment, which restricts the tax relief, although I understand that Opposition Members object to the general principle of the relief. However, in this instance it restricts it to the original intention, and I hope that on that basis the amendment will be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In so far as the amendment tightens up the conditions that make tax relief available for private medical insurance, we do not seek to divide the Committee on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) who on Second Reading and in the discussion during the Committee stage on the Floor of the House, drew attention to the effect of European regulations on the proposals on private medical insurance. It may be due to his promptings that new amendments have been tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the new amendments tidy up the Bill. We shall not seek to divide the Committee on amendment No. 164 because we wish to deal with the more substantive points of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you said, Mr. Cormack, the major amendments are to the next clause and our major discussion should centre on it. But we should not let the debate on clause 52 finish without making a general point on clauses 52, 53 and 54. We are in a unique position because the tax relief made available for private medical insurance is open ended in three ways. It is open ended, first, in the numbers of persons over 60, and some under 60, who are eligible to claim the benefit; and secondly, in the cost that could have to be met by the Exchequer because no limit is placed on the amount of money covered by the policies. Thirdly, it is open ended because such a system will have an inflationary effect on Health Service costs. In so far as that is so, it is unfortunate that we are discussing only definitions of the contract between the person taking out private medical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
insurance and the company, and what the Government are prepared to support. We do not have even a draft of the regulations that might restrict the health care on which insurance tax relief can be provided to medical treatments, as opposed to dental treatments. We have no evidence about what costs in the form of tax relief the Board of Inland Revenue will consider reasonable. We are, therefore, discussing the definition of the contract without a clear idea of what it involves. It offends every traditional Treasury principle, that there should be no open-ended commitments to numbers of people and amounts of money, and that a policy should not be agreed that will have an inflationary effect on Health Service costs. It is unfortunate that the Treasury has not seen fit to give us even a copy of the draft regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since February discussions have taken place between the Government and the private medical insurance industry. On 17 February I asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tell me whether he was discussing private medical insurance tax relief with health boards up and down the country—which are affected by the proposals because pay beds are obviously involved in the scheme—doctors, nurses and other interested parties who represent the consumers of health care. The answer was that he was discussing his proposals with the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Association of British Insurers, the British United Provident Association, Private Patients Plan, the Western Provident Association, the Bristol Contributory Welfare Association, the Exeter Hospital Aid Society and the Civil Service Medical Aid Association."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 February 1989; Vol. 147, 	<i>c. 479.</i>]</p></blockquote>
In other words, we are asked to pass clause 52 without knowing what the draft regulations are, but knowing that they are being discussed only with that select group of individuals representing the private medical insurance industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal will cost the Exchequer at least £40 million in the first year and, depending on what the Chief Secretary calls the marketing of the private medical insurance industry, will cost a great deal more in the years to come. I cannot believe that it is right that on a proposal of such importance we should be asked to pass this very general clause stipulating what a contract is without the draft regulations or without there having been consultation with a far broader group of people. We fear that the consultations that are taking place at present are one-sided and will give succour to the private medical insurance industry without properly protecting either National Health Service patients or the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Chief Secretary should tell us in his reply to this short debate what the draft regulations are, what they will contain, and with whom they will be discussed before they are brought before the House of Commons—presumably after the summer. If he is not prepared to give us the regulations today, it would be useful for the Committee to know when they are likely to be published and when, therefore, they will be debated on the Floor of the House. It is unsatisfactory that whereas we spend a great deal of time in the Committee discussing other clauses in the minutest of detail, we should today be asked to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
consent to the general principle of a contract between an individual and the private medical insurance industry that will cost cumulatively at least £40 million. We are being asked to do that without knowing the precise details of that contract and without even having the draft regulations before us, while knowing perfectly well that the only people whom the Government are consulting at present are from the private medical insurance industry—precisely the people who stand to benefit, perhaps even at the expense of patients in the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) made several specific points, which I shall answer in a moment. We shall return to some of his points—which I concede are important—under clause 53, and I suspect that we shall have a longer and more detailed debate on the matter in the fairly near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that this was a general clause. It is very important: it sets a clear framework for determining which contracts and medical insurance will qualify for the tax relief that we propose. Like any new tax relief, it is clearly essential that it be defined beyond doubt and properly targeted, and we are determined that we shall meet both those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, we had three main objectives that we wanted to ensure were met. First, we wanted to keep the rules for the new relief as simple and straightforward as possible. Secondly, we wanted to provide that they should be due only where a contract provides no significant benefits other than indemnity for genuine medical costs. The purpose of that is simple, and the hon. Gentleman and I would agree about it: it is to prevent abuse. Finally, we wanted to ensure that we met our obligations to our European partners by allowing European Community insurance companies to offer tax relieved medical insurance if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made some detailed points, to which I shall seek to reply. He referred first to his concern that the relief is open ended, and he specified the ways in which he believed that it is open ended. I understand his concern, but I do not accept that the relief is open ended, for various reasons. The treatments permitted under the contracts eligible for tax relief will be carefully defined in regulations, so there is no open-ended option there. There is also a natural limit on insurance costs for such treatments, and competition among medical insurers, a number of whom are non-profit making, will help to ensure that subscribers get the best value for money. Therefore, although I understand why the relief appears open ended to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East, it certainly is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is concerned that the regulations are not yet available, and wonders when they will be available and what they will contain. We intend that they will be available in the early autumn, when I have no doubt that the Opposition will pray against them and we shall have a full debate.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
Although discussions are not yet concluded with the bodies that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, it is intended that treatments that may be covered by eligible contracts—that is, those that we shall specify in regulations—will include medical and surgical treatments normally available in National health Service hospitals, and ancillary services such as diagnosis, nursing care and certain treatments by GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we shall not include treatments not normally available under the National Health Service, such as cosmetic surgery for non-medical reasons. Cosmetic surgery for legitimate medical reasons—for example, following a motor accident—would certainly be included. We shall probably also exclude routine dental work—that is, non-hospital dental and ophthalmic treatment—although that is still under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause sets an important framework for the relief offered under clause 51. The conditions that circumscribe that relief are set out in clauses 52 to 54.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that a number of papers now refer to the discussions, to which we have referred, between the Government and the private medical insurance industry and to the points made by the industry and by the Inland Revenue. Does the Chief Secretary agree that all those papers should be placed in the Library, and that they are a legitimate subject of concern for the Opposition and for others concerned with the Health Service? Does he further agree that there should be wider consultation before he finally frames the regulations to be published in the autumn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always keen to agree with the hon. Gentleman whenever I can, not least in the interest of progress. However, I must enter a ripple on our present harmony by saying that I cannot agree with his present proposition. Our discussions with medical insurers are needed to ensure the smooth introduction of the relief. There are several ways in which the relief will be circumscribed, which we shall discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that discussions with the health boards and others would help the process of determining what regulations the Government wish to bring before the House. The health boards have been free to make representations since the relief was announced on 31 January. When I was at the Department of Health and Social Security, the health boards made representations when they felt that they had an important point to make. I do not think that they have made any representations, so the hon. Gentleman's concerns are more theoretical than practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to reply to the Chief Secretary, but we take issue with several points that he raised, not all of which are covered by our amendments, and many of which are central to the definition of a contract in clause 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary's first point was that his discussions with the private medical insurance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
industry are private and are designed to expedite the introduction of the private medical insurance scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my exact expression, which has a slightly different meaning, was, "to ensure the smooth introduction of the relief." It is self-evident from the fact that we have had to table technical amendments that it is often difficult to ensure that the precise intention required is phrased in legislation. For that reason, among others, it is essential to discuss the matter with insurers to make sure that we have the information required to frame the regulations in a way that meets our requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary is describing one part of his discussions, which is how the regulations are to be properly framed. But the regulations go to the heart of the scheme. Clause 52 is merely the skeleton of what the contract will entail; the gist of the Chief Secretary's remarks was to accept that that was so. Indeed, he said that decisions had not yet been made about what was to be included or excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can surmise only that those decisions will be made as a result of discussions within the Treasury and with those whom the Government are consulting. When we are discussing matters of substance, such as what is included in private medical insurance contracts, it is entirely wrong that the only people whom the Government have specifically contacted and invited to meetings to discuss proposals are those in the private medical insurance industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary also said that the health authorities and boards were not being specifically consulted, although they could put their suggestions to the Government. As those bodies are directly involved in the conclusions that will be reached and the recommendations that will be made, they, of any group, should be consulted before the draft regulations are produced, for this reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One set of proposals will refer not only to private hospitals—those run by BUPA or those run for profit—but to the future use of pay beds in National Health Service hospitals. One vehicle for private medical insurance tax reliefs will be the further encouragement of the use of pay beds in NHS hospitals. That affects not only the beds in those hospitals but the use of nursing and medical staff, including doctors and consultants, as well as the use of operating theatres and other facilities. So how can we proceed on the basis of the Chief Secretary's proposals that regulations will be drawn up for consultation with the private medical insurance industry if those consultations do not involve health authorities whose pay beds and staffing resources will be directly affected by the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Chief Secretary, even at this stage, to reconsider his decision to narrow the scope of the group that he is prepared to consult directly to the private medical insurance industry. The regulations, which will come before the House in the autumn, are important and it is wrong that the group to be consulted is so narrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
The Chief Secretary said that he was not prepared to make public, which includes putting them in the Library, the relevant papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no formal papers to put in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that there are no formal papers to put in the Library, and I ask the Chief Secretary to reconsider that. I had consultations with the private medical insurance industry yesterday and this morning and I was told about a confidential paper that formed the basis of at least one meeting with the Treasury or the Board of Inland Revenue. It is clear that there is a paper, or papers, which refer to the Government's proposals or their consultations with the private medical insurance industry and that the papers were presented to the industry and to all the other organisations that I listed earlier. Perhaps the Chief Secretary now wishes to correct the statement that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there are papers; they are marked "Confidential"; they refer to the scheme; but they are not available to the Committee and will not be put into the Library. I have been told by the private medical insurance industry that the papers exist and I hope that the Chief Secretary will correct his statement. Otherwise, we shall not be able to proceed with a satisfactory discussion. Why should the papers be condifential and why should the Chief Secretary deny their existence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond, because there is the danger of misunderstanding and it is wise to clear up the matter as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I replied to the hon. Gentleman, I said that there were no formal discussion papers that were to be generally circulated and to be made available to other bodies such as the health authorities and, perhaps, the Opposition and others. The only papers of which I am aware or that I have been advised of—I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to these—are informal lists of possible treatments for discussion. That information has just been confirmed, but if I have been misinformed, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essentially, we are seeking to determine a smooth introduction and for that reason we need to discuss the appropriate treatments which are likely to be covered by insurance—and which we believe are covered by normal Health Service treatment—with the insurers in order to ensure that we do not spread the relief too widely. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now understand only too well what is happening. A discussion is taking place between the Government and the private medical insurance industry on the appropriate list of treatments to be included in the contracts for the purposes of private medical insurance tax relief. That goes to the heart of our present debate. The Government's discussion is not an informal one with the industry about how it might redraft the wording of a clause or part of a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
regulation. The discussion goes to the very heart of the items that will be considered for tax relief under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary should now answer my question. Will he place in the Library or make public the list that is being discussed? It appears in the paper marked "Confidential", which includes the very detail of the scheme, which should come before the Committee before we decide on clauses 52 and 53. The detail has been denied to us because the paper has gone only to the private medical insurance industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has exceedingly well-developed conspiracy theories. I am sorry that he believes them because no conspiracy is involved, even though he may dig deeply to try to find one. When the discussions are concluded, they will not be kept secret. The fruits of them will be brought to the House of Commons for debate and decision. Nothing secret or unusual is taking place. It is normal practice when the Government are in the process of determining a policy that they will subsequently bring it forward for Parliament to accept or reject. It is no more secret than when the Opposition—I shall be non-contentious and omit any further comment in the twin interests of harmony and progress. There is no conspiracy and nothing for the hon. Gentleman to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the last person to look for conspiracy theories, but what the Chief Secretary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would remove the term "eligibility". The concept of "eligibility" in clause 53 as drafted is slightly different from that in clauses 51 and 52. The amendment would remove confusion and make the legislation clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 166 and 168 deal with another aspect of the clause that is unsatisfactory at present. The clause provides for the Inland Revenue to certify that medical insurance contracts meet certain conditions, and for the Revenue to revoke the certification when a contract ceases to satisfy those conditions. But the Revenue is also required by clause 53 as drafted to revoke a certification even where it has no knowledge that the relevant conditions are no longer satisfied. That is clearly impractical, and the amendments therefore provide for the Board of Inland Revenue to revoke
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
a certification only where it comes to its notice that the conditions ceases to be satisfied.

Amendment No. 217, which relates to clause 53, should read:

not "for lung diseases". Amendment No. 219 has an even more significant error. It should read
	<br><blockquote><p>"and provided that the insurer makes a payment to the National Health Service to cover all costs of training nurses in the public sector",</p></blockquote>
not "in the private sector". Hon. Members should realise that we are not debating lung diseases, and references to them, other than those made 	<i>en passant,</i> will be ruled out of order.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments attempt to put a ceiling on the amount of money that would be eligible for tax relief—the cost of a policy—and demand that certain conditions should be met in the contracts. The conditions are that the administrative costs of the private medical insurance schemes are not greater than the administrative costs of the National Health Service. That would ensure that the money for which tax relief is being awarded is spent on health care rather than on the administration or marketing of private health insurance policies. The other amendments in the group, which are probing, insist that if the private health insurance industry received tax relief, the cover offered would be comprehensive, so that patients with long-term or chronic illnesses would know that they were guaranteed cover under the schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government should provide us with a formula to ascertain how much advertising costs.

Private health companies should make it clear in their accounts what moneys have been devoted to administration and what moneys have been devoted to health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the evidence suggests that the administrative costs in the National Health Service amount to about 5 per cent., but administrative costs for BUPA come to 10 per cent. of the resources spent. I understand that such costs are even higher for Private Patients Plan. Some of the other schems that have not been investigated may have administrative costs that are higher still. I shall deal further with that point shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
The other amendments in the group ensure that certain items that some people may think should be eligible for private medical insurance tax relief are not eligible, and would not, therefore, become a drain on the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are drafted in the context of our view that this subsidy is wrong in principle, because the queue is being invited to subsidise the queue jumper, and is also wrong in practice. The Government are proposing an open-ended commitment without giving sufficient information about whether the regulations will ensure that the taxpayer will get a good deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary referred to private dental care. Amendment No. 221 would exclude private dental care from the scope of private medical insurance policies. The Chief Secretary thought that dental care would probably be excluded, but he could not give us a definitive answer. He must be aware of the lobby for private dental care to be included as part of private medical insurance policies. I hope that he can give us a definitive answer at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, on 25 April, the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Couchman) declared an interest in a company called Denplan, which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"may well prove to be the most important financing scheme for primary health care in the private sector."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 April 1989; vol. 151, c.857.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that Denplan and similar schemes offering private dental insurance should be eligible for the same sort of cover that will be provided for medical care. He drew our attention to the dangers of having too general a definition in the Bill without having the regulations before us. He cautioned the Chief Secretary about having "too prescriptive a definition" of what was covered by private medical insurance so that private dental care could, at a later stage, be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gillingham suggested not only that we should give public funds in the form of tax reliefs for private medical and dental care, but that we should subsidise people who used private dentists and were insured for dental care at home and abroad. The proposal is widely drawn and would involve the taxpayer in substantial sums of money, if accepted by the Government. Before we allow the scheme to proceed, we must ensure that strict regulations will exclude items such as private dental care from eligibility for tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Chief Secretary will not be moved by the proposals from Denplan or the private dental insurance lobby. When we examined Denplan, we found that the company had accumulated losses of half a million pounds. Therefore, we are being asked to subsidise private dental insurance for a loss-making company, which has proved itself to be inefficient in the private sector and is now looking to the public sector to bail it out. I hope that dental care will be excluded from the proposed scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other problems arise from the wide scope of the definition of "contract" and of what is eligible for tax relief. On 17 May, BUPA wrote a letter dealing with private medical insurance tax relief. It said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any policy including entitlement for nursing care would come within the requirements as they exist provided the scheme did not include a cash benefit in excess of £5.00 per night."</p></blockquote>
A cash benefit in excess of £5 per night for people using, for example, the National Health Service, has been excluded. But until BUPA's letter appeared, we did not know that policies would include entitlement to nursing care. Many definitions could be applied to what is eligible for tax relief under "nursing care". It could include not only nursing care in a private hospital or at home, but in nursing homes. That opens up a huge potential for Government subsidy of the private nursing home industry, or people who use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we proceed with regulations, we need an assurance from the Chief Secretary that the scope of private medical insurance tax reliefs will not be as wide as BUPA believes they are, or Denplan wants them to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the question of who supports the proposals before us, and who would be in favour of our amendments. The Chief Secretary will probably be aware that the Select Committee on Social Services reported today. Its report, "Resourcing the National Health Service: The Government's White Paper, Working for Patients", makes it absolutely clear that the Select Committee, which has a Conservative majority with two members dissenting from the general terms of the report, does not believe that private medical insurance tax relief is a wise use of scarce public resources. The report refers to the cautionary advice that the Select Committee gave the Government immediately before the White Paper on health was published: that the scheme be abandoned and that there should be no open-ended private medical insurance tax relief either for everybody or for people over 60. It also says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The planned tax subsidy … need thorough and more detailed examination … The Government needs to be able to demonstrate that this money would not be better spent on direct investment in patient care."</p></blockquote>
In all the debates that we have had on the matter on the Floor of the House—debates on the White Paper on health care, on the Budget and during the Bill's Second Reading—the Select Committee on Social Services has not been persuaded by the Chief Secretary's arguments that a better use of scarce public resources would be to give money to private medical health care tax reliefs, rather than to the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee took evidence from people in the medical insurance industry, the NHS health authorities, doctors, nurses and many others. It listened to what happened in America as a result of tax reliefs being available for private medical insurance. It heard the evidence of those associated with how those schemes work in America and now concludes that the Government have been unable to demonstrate that the money would be better spent on investment in private medical insurance tax relief than on investment in patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's report, issued today, represents the widespread feeling on both sides of the House that the scheme is a wasteful use of public resources. Our amendments, which would give the Chief Secretary the choice of a ceiling of £200, £300 or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
£400, are a restriction on a bad scheme, rather than leaving the scheme open ended in the amounts of money that would qualify for tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the Select Committee on Social Services is in line with what has been said by the British Medical Association, by Help the Aged and by Age Concern which, at the time of Second Reading, urged us not to go ahead with the scheme. It is in line also with the general feeling of people throughout the country. What will be covered by the private medical insurance tax reliefs? How can we justify the claim that that will relieve pressure on the National Health Service? What will pensioners and others get in return for the money that they pay out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.21 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>5.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was stating the Opposition's view that if private medical insurance schemes were to relieve pressure on the National Health Service we would need some proof that their cover was comprehensive and that the private health industry was able to offer the facilities needed by those people who would be enticed or persuaded to take up the schemes. I wanted to draw the Committee's attention to a case described in 	<i>The Independent</i> on 31 October 1988 of a 64-year-old woman who had taken out private medical insurance. Whenever she became ill with any illness that we might classify as serious she found that the private medical insurance industry, despite charging her substantial sums of money for her policy and despite now wanting the public to subsidise that policy, was quite unable to provide the service she required. She became ill with cancer and suffered renal failure. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the very time when you need private health insurance, they tell you they won't cover you for the very things that you need."</p></blockquote>
She found that despite the claims made of the great merits of private medical insurance she eventually had to rely on the National Health Service for treatments for those major problems. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as you are really ill they come along and say they don't want to know… What I do need is cover for what is wrong with me now, when I've been a member of PPP for more than 30 years. What they are offering me is almost a £200 increase in subscription, to £934 a year.".</p></blockquote>
Having been asked to pay that extra sum she found that there was no cover for the very conditions for which she thought she had insured herself in the first place. That is the problem and that is why we seek to ensure that the policies that are granted tax relief provide comprehensive cover and why we ask in these probing amendments that private medical treatment also be given for chronic and long-term illnesses and disabilities when people with private medical insurance policies develop them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disturbs us more is that the private medical insurance industry seems quite reluctant to cover the illnesses from which many pensioners are likely to suffer. Mr. Bob Graham of BUPA says that chronic illness is not a suitable subject for insurance and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
another way must be found to tackle it. That other way is not another private health insurance policy, but reliance on the National Health Service. The Private Patients Plan brochure defines treatment as a surgical or medical procedure the purpose of which is to cure a medical condition and not to alleviate long-term illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition by BUPA and Private Patients Plan of what they regard as comprehensive cover excludes cover for chronic illness and for anything beyond surgical or medical procedures that does not alleviate a long-term illness. The private medical insurance industry provides no proper cover for people with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should taxpayers subsidise those private medical insurance policies for private individuals when the measures that are enacted do not ensure that comprehensive cover is available for people with private medical insurance policies? Even when private medical insurance tax relief is provided up to an unlimited sum of money for particular individuals, the National Health Service must still foot most of the bill for those patients in difficulty. Far from devising a scheme that relieves pressure on the National Health Service, even when people take out private medical insurance policies and even when this country subsidises those private policies, it is the National Health Service that must deal with most of the complaints that patients face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the policy of another private medical insurance company, there is no possibility of insurance for nursing the elderly infirm or even for surgical treatments that would be regarded as serious. Once again, people would have to rely on the National Health Service eventually. It is a sad business to compare that reality with the claims by some private medical insurance companies of what they can do. When BUPA made its case to the Government, on 14 June 1988 the chairman spoke for the principle of private medical insurance tax relief:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, for example, the over 65s"—</p></blockquote>
the Government have been even more generous, by covering the over-60s—
	<br><blockquote><p>"were given an incentive, whether by way of tax relief on their subscriptions or by some other means"—</p></blockquote>
no doubt that could be considered later in the Government's private discussions with BUPA and other organisations—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… much of the treatment during the remaining years of their lives would be in the private sector. A huge burden would thus be lifted from the shoulders of the NHS. Those senior citizens who continued to use the NHS would then find their waiting times drastically reduced and the resources available to treat them much increased."</p></blockquote>
That is the claim. The reality is more like the description by the pensioner in 	<i>The Independent</i> article that despite paying money to Private Patients Plan for 30 years, she was not covered properly under that scheme when she became seriously ill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A whole series of private medical insurance schemes are now being marketed. A Conservative party handout, which I picked up a few days ago, markets the latest scheme with the headline:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Prime Health offers you the private health prescription you have been looking for—Comprehensive cover plus unbeatable value."</p></blockquote>
That is now given advertising space in Conservative party publications. The handout begins with the remarkable admission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every day, all around the country, doctors are reluctantly having to tell their patients the disturbing news that there is a very long waiting list for the operation they require. The facts are that over 750,000 people are currently waiting for treatment…and over 160,000 of them have already been waiting a year or more."</p></blockquote>
That advertising literature has been circulated in Conservative party circles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. Peter Brooke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman supply me with a copy of that document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the chairman of the Conservative party is his own advertising standards authority, but I hope that he will look at it, no doubt to find out whether the advertisement lives up to the expectations raised by the headline. When we looked at the conditions in more detail, we found that "Prime care plus" did not cover the cost of any ailment for which a pensioner had had to consult a GP in the past fives years. Therefore, although Prime Health would pick up the policy under the new scheme and insure the person, such a pensioner would not get cover, even though he had private medical insurance subsidised by us through tax relief. The taxpayer would pick up the bill for the treatment and would end up paying twice over, not just in the tax relief for the private medical insurance policy, but in funding the National Health Service which would pick up the pieces as "Prime care plus" failed the pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see, too, that 	<i>The Sun,</i> which is one of the Government's favourite newspapers, has an
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exclusive Sun offer. Free family health cover"</p></blockquote>
Private health care is now being advertised with a joint partnership between Mr. Murdoch and a private health care scheme. Despite claims that it covers everything, Family Health Cover can provide cover for only certain conditions unidentified for some years before that person takes out private medical insurance. We are being asked to give unlimited public funds in tax relief to subsidise private medical insurance policies which cannot—unless the amendment is accepted—cover many of the serious illnesses that will afflict pensioners
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument behind amendments Nos. 216, 217, 218, 220 and 221 is that unless we have an assurance that these private health insurance policies are comprehensive in their cover, we shall have a duplication of public payment. First, there will be a payment in tax relief to the private medical insurance industry. Secondly, there will be a payment for health care that will have to take place under the National Health Service since the private industry will undoubtedly fail people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled amendments Nos. 211, 212, 213 and 219 to deal with an even more significant disadvantage of the scheme. The question is whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
it is a better use of public resources to have money spent on private medical insurance tax relief or on the National Health Service. The Select Committee on Social Services seems in no doubt that the Government have not proved their case that private medical insurance tax relief is a better use of public funds than giving money directly to the National Health Service which needs it. It is ironic that we should be debating this proposal when the Chief Secretary has this week received from the Secretary of State for Health a demand that the Health Service must have more money—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is a demand that he must receive by tomorrow, as that is when the bids for public spending must be received. If it is only leaks and rumours from the Department of Health that it is demanding specific sums of money, so be it. However, I understand that the Secretary of State for Health is clear in his request for more money for the Health Service, beyond the figures that the Government considered generous. It is clear why the Secretary of State needs more money and it will become clear that it would be better to give the Health Service money directly than to give these private medical insurance tax reliefs. Despite the claims about the generosity of the award to the Health Service in this and the coming financial year, higher than expected inflation has eroded much of the value of those awards. The Health Service is still underfunded and waiting lists in England have, tragically, not gone down, but gone up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it a better use of public resources to give them to the Health Service or to the private sector? Our information is that the National Health Service is far more cost-effective than the private sector. We can produce figures to show that almost every operation is carried out more cost-effectively in the public sector than in the private sector. The evidence shows that administration costs are higher in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point defeats the case of the Government and the Chief Secretary that using money for tax reliefs for private medical insurance is more cost-effective because it relieves pressure on the National Health Service. A study by the Department of Health on the movement of nurses and nursing skills between the National Health Service and the private sector shows that when the private sector expands, the NHS suffers through the loss of qualified, trained and skilled nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Health Service spends money training nurses, giving them skills for the expansion of health care in the public sector, but because of allurements from the private sector those highly qualified nurses are lost. So the National Health Service is not helped by the expansion of private care but loses scarce nursing resources, especially, as the survey points out, theatre nurses. One reason why the Health Service is unable to reduce its waiting list is that it does not always have the qualified people to run operating theatres because it has lost nurses and doctors to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
The survey suggests that the Government would have to spend more money training nurses or have an arrangement for the private sector to pay for the training of nurses if an expansion of the private sector were not to be a drain on NHS resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in the 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> in January 1989 referred to a project funded by the Department of Health—I give it credit for that—about the use of resources in the private sector and the extent to which that affects the National Health Service. The article concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is difficult to see how in the short term private sector activity could increase further without NHS consultants doing more work outside the normal working week, which may have consequences for the costs of treatment, or without many full time consultants switching to part time work, thereby reducing their NHS caseload. Similarly, the nursing pool is finite, and there is already evidence of shortages in nursing staff in the NHS resulting in bed closures, and these shortages may be exacerbated by the burgeoning private sector, which, it is known, recruits about half its nursing staff from NHS posts."</p></blockquote>
That is the finding of research funded by the Department of Health. It questions the basis of the arguments put forward by the private medical insurance industry and the Government, who have voiced their concern in recent months. Not only is it a better use of public resources to invest in the National Health Service, but it is clear that the private sector is draining resources away from the National Health Service and using them less efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, our amendments seek to limit the damage done by the implementation of a scheme that we shall not support. We propose to limit the amount of tax relief available on private medical insurance and to require the private sector to provide comprehensive care when it obtains private medical insurance tax relief, and to cover the training costs incurred by the National Health Service on its behalf. We cannot support a scheme that asks people on waiting lists to subsidise the queue-jumper, and taxpayers to make a limitless commitment to the private sector, when we know that the National Health Service would be the far more cost-effective user of the scarce resources available for health care in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Conservative Members expressed their reservations about the scheme during the Committee stage on the Floor of the House and expressed their doubts and opposition to it in the Select Committee on Social Services report. I hope that they will tell the Government that enough is enough, and that the scheme is a waste of resources and the wrong way to use public money. The Opposition's amendments are an attempt to limit the damage done by the whims of the Prime Minister which have produced a scheme that the majority of British people find repugnant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to ask several questions about the proposed scheme. I also wish to comment on the ineffectiveness of private treatment. En passant, I say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already negated what he said in his Budget speech. He said that the scheme would be for people over 60, but under the Bill nearly 1 million people under 60 could benefit from the tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled several amendments to limit premium costs. Our figures are reasonable in terms
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
of the cost of treatment within the National Health Service. The options of £200, £300 or £400 are eminently reasonable, but differ from the costs of premiums under the various companies that provide care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Exeter Hospital Aid Association offers couples aged 65 first-class treatment at £602.38 a year and second-class treatment at £438.96 a year. For single people aged 70 its first-class treatment costs £365.43 a year and second-class treatment £262.20. Figures range from BUPA's first-class treatment for a single person aged 70 of over £1,000 a year, down to the Private Hospital Plan's premium of £330, which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"basically a low-cost relief from 'waiting lists' plans. Discretionary doubling of benefits for complications."</p></blockquote>
Almost all schemes offered by private companies are vastly in excess of the reasonable cost of the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is reflected in treatment costs. In the National Health Service a tonsillectomy costs, on average, £360; privately, a patient would be lucky to get it for £600, and the cost may be as much as £1,400. Hernia operations in the NHS cost £710, but the cheapest in the private sector is £950, rising to £2,000 if the patient is unlucky enough to be caught by a hospital that is really on the make or is very inefficient. That shows how the private sector charges vastly more than the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have the scheme at all, we should be able to set a limit on it in the legislation. Can the Minister say whether the Government are prepared to accept any of the amendments or would they prefer to set a slightly higher figure? The Government should set a limit on what private companies can charge for administrative costs by using the Health Service as a yardstick. Will they do that when they approve the contracts for treatment? Will the scheme give comprehensive cover?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that the contracts should cover all treatments that are normally available in the NHS, but will they confirm that they will specify that in the contract and that the cost, which will be covered by the private treatment, will be similar to costs in the NHS? It is important to include chronic and long-term illnesses and disability, because 60 per cent. of people between 65 and 74 have long-term illnesses. Of those over 74, 69 per cent. have long-term illnesses. The normal run of private pension plans will not cover long-term and chronic illnesses, so a large section of the elderly population will be excluded from the Government's scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we oppose the scheme in principle, if there is to be a scheme it should be open to everyone, irrespective of health. The worse health a person has, the more important it is that he receives treatment. Before the Government approve a contract, will they ensure that those with long-term and chronic illnesses and disabilities are included?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that the Government get rid of other restrictions on the private health care sector.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
Almost all the schemes have a maximum age of entry. For example, anyone over the age of 74 can forget about insurance with the Exeter Hospital Aid Association. Shield Plus, Senior Primecare, BUPA Budget, PPP and Sun Alliance Health First all have age limits of 74. Some have lower limits. For Prime Health Primecare, Primecare Plus, BUPACare and Private Hospital Plan the age limit is 64. For the Bristol Contributory Welfare Association the cut-off point is at 69. Therefore, under the current private plans many people will not be eligible for the tax relief proposed because of their age. If they were and if they applied, that might put a new gloss on the estimated costs of the scheme. The Treasury might blanch at the thought of providing tax relief for all those who are excluded under the existing private plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will say that they do not intend to allow private companies to place age entry restrictions on the contracts that they approve. We are opposed in principle to the scheme, but if it is to exist, it should be available to everybody irrespective of age and health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally we should consider the important point of whether the private sector pays the real costs of the staff that it employs. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) pointed out that this came to roughly £10,000 per nurse trained in the public sector and who moves across at low cost to the private sector. Frankly, a levy should be imposed on the private sector if the scheme is to make headway. I am interested to hear what the Government will say about stopping the private sector acting in this parasitic fashion on the publicly funded Health Service. In connection with the way in which the schemes are costed, do the Government intend to specify in the contracts covered by the scheme the medical, aftercare, nursing, administrative and advertising costs of the company? Anyone considering using one of the companies should know exactly what he or she is paying for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of justice and equality, I hope that the Government will state that they will sweep away many of the private sector's restrictions when the scheme is introduced. It will then be available to all. I hope that the Conservative Members who have expressed their doubts will vote with us to give us a majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At best, the scheme is an unnecessary incentive to many people who have already made the free choice to take up private health insurance. They are fully entitled to do that, but they do not need an incentive from the Government. At worst, the scheme is a subsidy to queue-jumping and that is the most distressing and disreputable aspect of it.

Like me, I am sure that the Chief Secretary has had to explain to people in his constituency surgery why they have been told by doctors that there was a long waiting list for an operation and that if they were prepared to go private they could have it within a fortnight. That has happened to me time and again, and I find it one of the most offensive features of our society. I hope that the Chief Secretary finds it similarly offensive and realises that he should be devoting efforts to putting right that terrible indignity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give another example, which a constituent of mine has found most offensive? He was waiting for a heart operation and his health authority, through money provided by the Government, offered him treatment in a private hospital in the west country and offered to pay for him to go there and back by taxi. If he did that, he could have the treatment about six months quicker than if he waited to be treated in his own hospital. He was livid that all those hundreds of pounds were being wasted on the non-medical side of his treatment rather than the money being spent on the hospitals in south Wales so that they could provide the treatment there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That illustration certainly shows up a deficiency in the Health Service. However, unlike the hon. Gentleman, I think that I would have said to his constituent, "Take it," because at least in that instance public resources were being used to ensure that the constituent could get the medical help that he needed. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman has done, I would have quickly used that instance to point to the enormous deficiencies in health provision in his area of south Wales. However, I would rather see patients assisted to get treatment where it is currently available, since their need is here and now, than see the money go into the subsidy to private insurance that we are discussing today. Indeed, I have argued for a right of patients to say that if the facility is available somewhere in the country, they should be entitled to make use of it if their doctor thinks that it is the right facility for them. They should have public support to get them to wherever that facility is available, if it is not available within their own health district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may tell the Chief Secretary that I have a case—about which I wrote to the Minister of State, Department of Health last week—where a constituent was offered an appointment with a consultant in 1991. My constituent could not believe it. In the face of such deficiencies in our Health Service, why are we diverting money in this way? Should we not at least place some limitation on the amount of money which is so dispersed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chief Secretary is engaged in discussions with health Ministers at present. Has any health Minister yet convinced him that it would be reasonable for him as Chief Secretary to say, "Yes, I give you an open-ended commitment, however much it costs, to provide a facility. However much the cost is increased by the level of demand for that facility, I, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will underwrite that commitment?" That is what the Chief Secretary is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
doing in this clause, and that is what the amendments restrict. I do not understand how he can defend the open-ended nature of these provisions, and the entirely demand-led level of public expenditure that they involve, when he cannot do the same for his ministerial colleagues who are asking that public provision in the National Health Service should meet at least some of the real demand from consumers who need medical attention. That is why I support the principle in the amendments of capping the facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential illogicality of the Government's proposals has emerged in some of our discussions today. It emerges when we consider that insurance relief is not available for policies that offer merely cash benefits. Yet there is a provision for cash benefits to be available to those who have taken out a medical insurance as long as that cash benefit is over and above the medical insurance provisions. There have been for many years health insurance policies which merely provide cash benefits to people at a time when they are in hospital and in medical need. I remember from my childhood that our neighbours used to belong to the Manchester hospital Saturday fund—an insurance scheme designed to give people benefits for the extra costs incurred when they were in hospital. I understand why the Government do not want to have an open-ended commitment to cash benefit insurance schemes, but where is the logic of this? Under the clause, someone who has taken out health insurance can be in a private hospital or have a pay bed in an NHS hospital and receive £5 a day for the many extra costs that arise when people are in that predicament. Yet someone in an NHS hospital, who has made separate national insurance provision for £5 a day for ancillary costs, cannot have tax relief on the insurance policy for that benefit. That is part of the essential illogicality of providing tax relief on private health insurance. The complex role of the private sector is a further reason why the Government should not get involved in public subsidy of private medical insurance.

The more we examine the details, the more we see—as the Select Committee on Social Services saw—that the Government should not be involved in this area. I reiterate to the Chief Secretary the commitment expressed by the Select Committee on Social Services: further tax concessions to encourage private health insurance are not desirable. They are not even necessary, and they represent a diversion of public funds. If there is to be such a diversion, it must at least be limited, and the amendments would provide a limit. We should not be doing our job as a Committee examining the Finance Bill if we did not press upon the Government our desire to contain public expenditure. I am amazed that the Chief Secretary does not appear to share that desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Opposition Members are infuriated that the White Paper, "Working for Patients", contains statements on the increase in private health provision such as:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government welcomes this increase, not only because it relieves pressure on the NHS but also because it increases the opportunities for the NHS and the independent sector to learn from each other".</p></blockquote>
That statement contains an unquestioned assertion that the private sector
	<br><blockquote><p>"relieves pressure on the NHS".</p></blockquote>
That is undemonstrated and unsupported by any evidence, but quoted time after time. I asked the Department of Health what research it had commissioned on the relationship between the National Health Service and the private sector. It came back with the articles that have been quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown). I should have thought that the research would have supported that contention, but it does the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 	<i>British Medical Journal</i> of January 1989 carried an article on research done by the University of Sheffield Medical School on the "Role of the private sector in elective surgery in England and Wales, 1986". It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is concluded that mainly for reasons of available manpower private sector activity may not be able to grow much more without arresting or reversing the growth of the NHS".</p></blockquote>
That research was done up to 1986. Naturally, there has been considerable expansion since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research commissioned by the Government warned them that if they expanded the private health sector, they would arrest the development, or promote the decline, of the National Health Service. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East, said, it is difficult to see how, in the short term, private sector activity could increase further without NHS consultants doing more work outside their normal week, or more and more consultants lessening their commitment to the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are clearly dealing with finite resources. Further expansion of the private sector does not aid the National Health Service but drags resources away from it. That is so with regard to NHS waiting times, too. The research says that there is no evidence that high levels of private sector activity are associated with reduced National Health Service waiting times, irrespective of the total level of the combined private sector and NHS activity. That means that one of the reasons for expanding private sector activity—the reduction of National Health Service waiting times—is not supported by Government-commissioned research. Despite that empirical evidence—not ideological assertion—the arbitrary extension of the private sector has been inserted into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also considerable concern about the effect of the extension of the private sector on the provision of NHS nursing services. We are heading for a period when, for demographic reasons, the recruitment of nurses in the NHS will be extremely difficult because the pool of available labour will shrink considerably. The research states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even without absolute growth, the private acute hospitals are likely to require greater numbers of highly skilled nurses"</p></blockquote>
who can only be those trained by the NHS. The private sector, including that which will make more provision for the elderly, will make heavy demands
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
on nurses who can undertake theatre duties. There is currently an estimated pool of 900 nurses. More and more are being siphoned off into the private sector so
	<br><blockquote><p>"the private sector will inevitably be competing with the NHS for trained and experienced staff".</p></blockquote>
The research shows that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the private acute sector fills 42 per cent. of its vacancies"</p></blockquote>
by taking staff from the NHS, and from a specific section of the NHS work force—the under-30s with specialist skills
	<br><blockquote><p>"such as theatre nursing, renal nursing, intensive care and oncology."</p></blockquote>
The nurses most needed by the NHS will also be those most in demand by the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us make no mistake. The Prime Minister's imposition on the Bill of an ideological requirement will damage the National Health Service directly. We challenge the Chief Secretary to find evidence to justify this misuse of public money. As my hon. Friends have said, the problem is not just that public money would have been better spent in other ways in the National Health Service. Unless the Chief Secretary can provide the Treasury with direct evidence to the contrary, we believe that there is a real risk that the £40 million will not support the NHS but will damage it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The further evidence of Government support and the pumping of £40 million into the private sector will support the Health Service in the way that a rope supports a dying man. The private sector is inefficient, more expensive than and a parasite on the NHS. Putting money into the private sector is not the most efficient use of public money. The figures show how inefficient the private sector is. It has an occupancy rate of between 35 per cent. and 50 per cent. compared with 81 per cent. in the NHS. Operations in the private sector are much more expensive. On average, a hip replacement under the NHS costs £2,390 but in the private sector it costs £4,450. Worst of all, and I speak with some feeling about this because my mother was a nurse until she retired, the private sector is essentially a parasite on the NHS. It trains no nurses, and it drains the NHS of the nurses it needs.

sector which is a leech on the NHS. Even as we speak the morale of nurses—nurses like my mother, nurses like those across the river at St Thomas' hospital and nurses in my area at St Bartholomew's and the Homerton hospital—is at a serious low. They can see clearly that the spirit and intention of these Budget proposals is to give the imprimatur of Government support to the private sector.

It is no coincidence that Mr. Murdoch of 	<i>The Sun</i> is promoting private health schemes through his paper.

These clauses are undoubtedly the thin edge of the wedge in the promotion of private medicine. The increased expansion of the private sector is not just parasitical on the NHS but does not lead to a more efficient and cost-effective form of medicine.

In my district of east London, we can see the inevitable consequences of the creeping privatisation of the National Health Service. We have one of the finest hospitals in the country—St. Bartholomews—which was set up hundreds of years ago by public subscription to provide health treatment for the poor. St. Bartholomews is now having to develop private facilities, in conjunction with an American private hospital, for City gents and yuppies. St. Bartholomews is having to turn its attention to yuppies and rich Americans because of the privatisation pressures from the Government.

Even at this late stage, we hope that the Government will take seriously the amendments which attempt to remedy the worst effects of the clause. We believe that the private sector has nothing to offer the Health Service and can act only as a drain and a parasite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 214 which raises the issue of administrative costs in the private health care world as opposed to the administrative efficiency of the National Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard how administrative costs in the National Health Service amount to 5 per cent. That is even less than the administrative costs of Marks and Spencer. I can illustrate my point with a story. I have had the experience, which I think may be unique among members of the Committee, of working as a billing clerk in a private hospital. I was the fellow who took in all the accounts from the various doctors and sent out bills to their unfortunate patients. The hospital was, of course, in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early in my work experience, I received a notification from a doctor with an account of a patient that he had seen for the first time. The patient had received some kind of radiation overdose from working with radiation machinery. The doctor talked to him for a couple of minutes and advised him to make an appointment for a proper consultation and check up. The whole exchange took three or four minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bill for that encounter was put on my desk to send to the patient. The doctor had charged $200 for that brief encounter. In my naivety and lack of experience, I thought that there was some mistake. So I went down the corridor to see the doctor. I said, "Sorry to disturb you, but I think that you must have made a mistake. You wrote down £200 when you obviously meant $20 for three minutes in which you gave no medicine or advice, but just told the fellow to come back at a convenient time". The doctor said that there was no mistake. When he saw my look of amazement, he said, "Don't worry, the insurance company will take care of the bill".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are so worried about the inefficiency of the private health care market. Amendment No. 214 would require the administrative costs of any insurer trying to exploit this tax relief to be superior to those of the National Health Service. If the Chief Secretary does not wish to be that stringent, he should at least concede that insurers should be required to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
be as efficient as the National Health Service. He should not say that it is too difficult to discover the administrative costs of a particular operation because he is always telling us that the NHS should try to ascertain what its costs are in all its various operations. The same should be required of any private insurance company, so the administrative costs should be made known and the Chief Secretary should not try to dispute that. If the costs exceed those that obtain in the NHS, it is reasonable to require that the insurers should be penalised by being excluded from this form of tax relief.

I hope that the Chief Secretary will comment on amendment No. 214 and the many excellent suggestions made in the other amendments. I further hope that he will accept some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly deal with some of the points, but in the hope of giving information rather than providing answers it may be of interest to the Committee to learn that Australia are 115 for six and need more than seven runs an over to win.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will not be an intervention whose details I shall enjoy better in this parliamentary Session than that just made by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell). If the hon. and learned Gentleman should obtain further information, I hope that you, Mr. Cormack, will permit him to deliver it at once to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a well-structured debate of principle and detail which was opened by the wide-ranging speech of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown). The hon. Gentleman may be a little surprised and even a little shocked to learn that, apart from the points of principle on which there is dispute across the Committee, he and I are in greater agreement on a number of matters than he may have imagined. That may worry him, but I promise not to tell his constituency executive committee if he will give me an undertaking that he will not tell mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dunfermline, East, for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) referred to amendment No. 214 and expressed concern about administrative costs. The essence of the amendment is that it appears to presuppose a read-across between the administrative costs of private medical insurers and those of the National Health Service. However, there is no read-across that can legitimately be seen. The administration of any insurance, whether medical, house or motor, is a beast dissimilar from that of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might have understood if the amendment had suggested that there was a comparison between the administrative costs of public and private sector hospitals, but that would not be a legitimate matter for a Finance Bill debate. However, I understand what worries the Opposition, so I assure the Committee that, overall, the medical insurance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
industry is competitively run. I hope that that allays the thread of concern which ran through their comments on amendment No. 214. People are offered a wide range of cover by a number of insurers and we judge that the competition between them will keep administrative costs to a minimum because those who wish to take out insurance will be keen to obtain competitively priced insurance and will research the market carefully before doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one compares the administrative costs as a proportion of income of the National Health Service and medical insurance companies, one runs into difficulties, essentially because of the different nature of their activities and the lack of any common definition of their income. That problem is almost impossible to overcome. At district health authority level, the National Health Service claims that its administrative costs are 4.2 per cent. of income, but the figure for the entire service, including regional health authorities, is considerably higher. The information is not explicit, but as far as one can see the figure would be some 6 per cent. I am afraid that there are no centrally-held figures of administrative costs of medical insurers, although I suspect that BUPA's administrative costs are higher—about 10 per cent. of premium income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of other medical insurers—run on a smaller scale with smaller overheads—probably have considerably lower costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be sure on this point. Does the Minister know that in Wales there is no regional health authority, and that the costs are those of the districts, so his argument would not apply to Wales? Does he therefore propose to exclude Wales from the provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That wins the prize as the most ingenious intervention of the afternoon. I can give the hon. Gentleman a clearcut and categorical answer no. I know that there is no regional health authority in Wales—other than the Secretary of State for Wales. I receive regular and detailed advice on the position in Wales from both my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and from my private secretary who is Welsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East asked that dental treatment should be excluded from the ambit of the insurance cover eligible for tax relief. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that non-hospital dental care is likely to be excluded when we have finished our deliberations. He also asked whether overseas treatment will be covered. Generally, it will not, except it is possible that the cost of essential treatment while on holiday abroad will be, but that matter is still under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the letter from BUPA saying that nursing care is included in the scope of the cover. I have several comments to make on that letter. It is not for BUPA, or anyone else, to anticipate the regulations that we intend to bring forward. Secondly, our present intention is to cover nursing care in hospital, but not in nursing homes. That answers the specific question that the hon. Gentleman asked. In the spirit of amity that is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
prevailing this afternoon, I can again give the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East the assurance that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about eligibility. Clause 53(3)(a) provides that the treatments permitted in eligible contracts will be specified in regulations. Those, as we have discussed, will be laid before Parliament later in the year. Our general approach will be that medical and surgical treatments of a kind normally available under the National Health Service will qualify for inclusion in eligible contracts, as will services ancillary to those treatments, including diagnosis and nursing care. In addition, certain private treatments by general practitioners may also be included. Those provisions are fully in line with the objective of the relief, which we made clear at the outset—it is to help to relieve pressure on the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary has said throughout that the Government's desire is that people who have private medical insurance while they are at work should be able to continue it after the ages of 60 or 65. On that basis, is there any one scheme marketed now by the private health care industry that qualifies under the regulations that he is proposing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the regulations have not yet been determined, it is difficult to be precise. I have no doubt that a scheme will qualify, and I suspect that there already is one that does. I cannot claim to be totally familiar with what is available, but I shall receive excellent advice on that. The regulations to which the hon. Gentleman referred are draft regulations, but have not yet been drafted. Until they are drafted, it is difficult for me to reply to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to chronic illnesses. It would not be right to specify that contracts must cover, for example, disabilities or chronic illnesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that is clear and the hon. Member for Bridgend touched on some of the arguments. First, the essence of insurance is that it covers only future unexpected events, not those that are certain to occur. If that were otherwise, we would be giving tax relief not on genuine insurance, but on virtually any payment for future expected needs, and we have no plans to do so. As the hon. Gentleman wisely said, the cost would be prohibitive and we are not keen to undertake that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Dunfermline, East, for Bridgend and for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) referred to amendments Nos. 211 to 213, which would limit the maximum premium possible under tax-relieved private medical insurance to £200, £300 or £400. I shall not be cheeky and suggest that in the amendments the hon. Members accept the principle of the Government's policy, because they would tell me explicitly that they do not. But they seem to accept it while seeking to hamstring it at the same time with the amendments. In impolite circles such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
amendments are known as wrecking amendments and they tend not to be accepted by the Government. They seek to impose artificial limits on the amount of premium payable for medical insurance contracts that attract tax relief and they would discriminate against those who must pay a higher than normal premium for their insurance cover. That includes the very old. Opposition Members dislike the principle, but they would not wish, if the principle is enacted, to discriminate against the very old. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may have been referring to these amendments when he said that some of his amendments were probing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have heard what I said about private medical schemes that already discriminate at various stages against old people. People cannot enter such schemes if they are older than 64, 69 or 74, depending on which scheme they wish to enter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is taking two matters together that need not necessarily be put together. It is true that some private medical insurance companies exclude people with specific characteristics, whether age or something else. Others may not exclude them. That depends on the specific insurance offered. I refer to the example that the hon. Gentleman gave earlier. If those inhibitions were not included in insurance contracts, many chronic and certain future ailments would be covered by private medical insurance at a substantially higher cost in tax relief, which is precisely what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues do not want. I am not sure that that is an attractive argument from the hon. Gentleman's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would have several other effects. They would certainly reduce flexibility and freedom of choice, and would act against the general purpose of the reasonable premium test by introducing a crude measure of price control. They are unnecessary if the intention is to ensure that the relief is not open-ended, as the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and other hon. Members said earlier. I made it clear that we do not accept that the relief is open-ended for the reasons that I gave earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying purpose of the reasonable premium requirement is specifically to prevent manipulation of relief, not to influence the pricing of insurance services in the market place. Such pricing controls simply do not work, as we have seen on many occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East also said that private medical insurance should be compehensive. Private medical treatment cannot deal with every eventuality that the National Health Service covers. I doubt that it ever will and we have never claimed that it could. It is very good at some operations where the NHS is under most pressure—for example, hip replacements. Each hip replacement in the private sector minimises the pressure that there would otherwise be on the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 215 the hon. Gentleman for Dunfermline, East referred to his intention to seek to require insurers to offer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"comprehensive cover open to all".</p></blockquote>
We have already touched briefly on the issue. Many, if not all, insurers already offer a fairly wide range of cover for those who wish to take it up. To pick up the question raised by the hon. Member for Bridgend, insurers are increasingly making it possible for people to take out cover at older ages if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people, including those aged 60 and over, will not want comprehensive cover. The medical insurance industry has recognised the need to offer cheaper, more limited cover to those who want the peace of mind of knowing that they can receive acute treatment for which public sector provision is most under pressure. That has always been an underlying purpose of the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the subsidy from taxes will finance what could be described as cosmetic and unnecessary work, not simply hip operations as the Chief Secretary suggests? The necessary work will still have to be done by the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is 100 per cent. wrong. As I said earlier, cosmetic treatment will not be eligible unless it results from, say, a car accident. Cosmetic treatment in the sense that the hon. Gentleman meant will not be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said that the private sector could expand only at the expense of the NHS. I understand why he said that, although I do not agree. We do not have to look to the future for an explanation. We expect an expansion of total resources devoted to health in both the private and public sectors, as has happened over many years. The private sector and the NHS have expanded dramatically. Collectively they have provided considerable extra resources for health care generally, which is an entirely desirable proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the remarks of the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, who raised the further important problem of nurse recruitment. He rightly said that the pool of labour would shrink in the future, and I agree. The Government are very worried about the problem, and it was one of the reasons for the introduction of the widely supported Project 2000 scheme, the final details of which are now under consideration. It will provide a much better training and career structure for nurses in the future, and was strongly supported by the Royal College of Nursing. That initiative is desirable because, as the hon. Gentleman said, we shall need to attract a substantial proportion of young people over the next few years to sustain the quality of nursing care that is needed.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
The hon. Member for Bridgend raised the issue of specifying limits on the cost of treatment administration and advertising. We see no need for that, simply on the ground of competition. If one company's overheads are high and its charges higher than those of its competitors, it will undoubtedly lose business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed stated what I know is his longstanding view that he has heard about nothing preferable to direct investment in the Health Service since our debates on the tax relief commenced some weeks ago. I understand his view, but it is a point of difference that we cannot bridge this evening. I nevertheless point out to him that our estimates of the cost of the tax relief are £40 million in the first year, and if the relief doubles over a period, that cost will become £70 million. That has to be set against a current-year cost for the National Health Service in public expenditure terms rather than revenue forgone, not of £70 million or £40 million, but of £26,000 million and rising rapidly. I do not have a calculator, but it is an infinitesimal percentage. A perhaps more compelling point is that within the past fortnight or so, I agreed a Supplementary Estimate for the National Health Service of about £40 million, and no one blinked at that increase, or even mentioned it, clearly not regarding it as a very sufficient sum. But that might equally hold true, not of £40 million in public expenditure, but of an equivalent sum in revenue forgone under the proposition of this tax relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that increase cash-limited? Or can it be increased on a demand-led basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman knew my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health, he would not need to ask that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend mentioned the fact that it was not possible to get cover over the age of 65 or 69. The Seventh Cavalry has come galloping to my rescue to say that companies are increasingly offering care for older people. I have in front of me a particular plan, which advertising prohibits me from mentioning, but if the hon. Gentleman is interested, as he reaches that age limit, I shall be happy to provide him with the brochure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East also referred to the serious issue of nurses' training. The private sector makes a useful and welcome contribution to post-basic specialist nurse training, but the Government realise that much more can be done. Within the past few days, my hon. and learned Friend the Minister for State, Department of Health announced the establishment of a joint working group with the representatives of the private sector and the English National Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting. That group will identify the private sector's capacity to participate in pre-registration nurse training, and identify the sector's demand for post-registration nurses and its potential input for training. I think that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East will welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East talked about the drain of nurses from the National Health
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
Service as did the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie. The National Health Service employs about 300,000 nurses in all. Research commissioned by the Department of Health shows that a net 1,000 nurses move to the private sector annually and, on average, those nurses joining the private sector have previously given at least five years post-qualification service to the National Health Service. So it is clear that there is no significant drainage in that respect. I end on that note of bedside reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be clear to the hon. Gentleman from what I have said that I cannot accept the amendment, but I hope that he will accept that there are many more points of agreement between us about the interpretation and detail of the measure than he may previously have expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Major</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are unexciting amendments. They correct drafting defects in the clause and I shall outline them with great speed. Amendment No. 170 deals with standard forms of medical insurance contract. A standard form is the type of arrangement that most medical insurers will wish to adopt for mass marketing. Instead of having each individual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
contract certified, the insurer will submit a standard form of contract to the Revenue to certify. He may then market it widely without resubmitting it to the Revenue unless, of course, there is a change of substance. In that case it would have to be resubmitted. The intention is to save work for the insurer and the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 52 envisages that approach, but clauses 53 and 54 as drafted do not provide the means to achieve it. The proposed amendments to clause 54 therefore allow the board, in regulations, to make the necessary provisions for certification of standard forms and for appeals against refusal by the board to certify standard forms. The regulations will provide for the certification to be carried out on the basis of the conditioins outlined in clause 53 for individual contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 171 is a small drafting amendment to correct a self-evident defect. As drafted, the clause would not have allowed the Inland Revenue directly to prescribe the form of the various documents needed to operate the scheme effectively—for example, claims for relief and annual returns from medical insurers. Instead, each individual form or document would have had to be laid out in detail in regulations, and any subsequent change would have had to be effected by amendment to the regulations. That would be cumbersome and inflexible, and would make the regulations considerably longer than they would otherwise need to be. The normal approach for other schemes is to allow the board to prescribe forms direct, and that is what the amendment would achieve for that specific relief. I trust that the Committee will accept the amendment, which is uncontentious and a drafting correction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
