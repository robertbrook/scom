	<div class='title'>DUTY TO ALLOCATE SEATS TO POLITICAL GROUPS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 19, line 44, after "body", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"including the governing body of a school"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 124, in page 21, line 33, after "applies", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the addition of school governing bodies".</p></blockquote>
No. 144, in schedule 1, page 120, line 36, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) a governing body of a school.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments No. 143 and 144 would extend the requirement for political ballots on council committees to governing bodies of schools. There was public outcry last year when the London borough of Barnet sought to secure 100 per cent. control by its majority party on school governing bodies. The amendment would enable the Government to move forward on an issue that they have accepted in principle. The Minister of State, Department of Education and Science talked about introducing legislation to require local education authorities to include minority party representation on their governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides an ideal opportunity for the Government to legislate without further delay. If the Government are not prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment or to amend the clause, perhaps they will at least confirm the Minister of State's intention to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would require a political balance among local authority nominees to the boards of all schools. There are fewer local authority nominees on the boards of voluntary schools and their numbers on the boards of council schools have been reduced by the Education (No.2) Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill establishes principles for providing representation of small minorities. The principles are summarised in subsection (5). There appears to be no intrinsic reason why similar principles should not apply to representation on governing bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and shall speak to amendment No. 124.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government accept the proposal, which offers them an opportunity to act. If they do not, they will raise doubts about their intentions as they have accepted the suggestion in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important because there has been clear politicisation of governing bodies since 1985. That trend is to be regretted although it is not reflected in most areas, irrespective of the party in control. Bexley in Kent is the best known Conservative example and Manchester is a Labour example. No member of the Committee would agree with either's practice. At present, the system is used to support particular political aims, which is not the objective of representation on governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A safeguard should be in the Bill and I am surprised that it is not. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that she accepts the principle. If not, she will have some explaining to do in the Committee as it will be clear that her seniors in the Government accept that the ability of parties to pack committees has been abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would make the rules on pro rata representation on local authority committees apply to school governing bodies. Amendment No. 143 adds to a reference to school governors the requirement to review representation of party groups on bodies which local authorities appoint. Amendment No. 124 does the same for the ambit of schedule 1 and amendment No. 144 makes the same change in schedule 1 itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education (No.2) Act 1986 made changes in the constitution of school governing bodies. It provided for a major element of parent representation. Many hon. Members welcomed that distancing from local authority representatives on school governing bodies so that no one group would outweigh the others. It was decided that school governing bodies are a partnership between local authority representatives, parents, teachers and other co-opted members, including people from industry and other local and voluntary groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The element of governors appointed by local education authorities is therefore much smaller since the 1986 Act. That is not to say that we do not acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's contention that abuses have occurred in appointments by some local education authorities. We do not regard the way in which some of them behave as within the spirit of the 1986 Act. Such authorities are of more than one political persuasion, as has been said, but I do not think that it would be right to follow the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) in mentioning examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has made it clear that he deprecates the actions of some authorities. The hon. Gentleman knows that because it was made clear in a letter to the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw). However, deprecating actions do not automatically lead to legislation, in spite of what Opposition Members say. The Government think that, in the new situation, the question of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
appointments by local education authorities is that much less significant. The case for legislation is therefore that much smaller.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So we can take it that the Minister is not accepting the recommendation of the Minister of State, Department of Education and Science, who said that she believed that there was reason to consider introducing legislation to require local education authorities to include minority party governors on governing bodies. I find it extremely odd that, on every other occasion when the Government have said that someone has done something wrong, they have considered it a reason for legislating, but on the one occasion when we agree with them, they have turned the other way, and said that they cannot use particular examples as a reason to legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it for me to regard the hon. Gentleman as a young man, but when he has been here a little longer—there were comments this morning about people who were wet behind the ears—he may begin to appreciate that if there is a wish to change the constitution of school governing bodies it is the tradition that the Department of Education and Science, rather than another Department, leads on that legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why, then, break with that tradition when legislating for Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Gentleman on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why, then, remove the voting powers of teachers on local education authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because education committees are local authority committees. School governing bodies are not local authorities or local authority committees. We believe that, in future, the question of appointments by local education authorities will be of less significance, and we are not convinced that the time is right for legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that it is right to put heavy emphasis on the political allegiance of appointees. The amendments would, in effect, give nominations to the political groups. That is right for local authorities, but it is not right for school governing bodies. Such bodies are not local authorities or local authority committees, and it would not be right to treat them as such. My right hon. Friend has made it clear that a fair and balanced approach is required. Opposition Members also want that. That would not be achieved by tying appointments to the exact proportions of parties on the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mechanism of the Bill, though well suited to local education committees—for which it was designed—is not suited to school governing bodies. The membership of those bodies should not be affected by every slight change of the political balance on the local education authority, nor should it necessarily be fixed at a uniform proportion across
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
the whole education authority. There may be strong arguments for appointments by an education authority to schools in different areas to vary. We are not convinced that the amendments would achieve that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall undertake to convey the Opposition's views to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not wholly satisfied with the Minister's reply. I am conscious that she has other pressing engagements, so I shall not detain her too long. While she consults the Secretary of State for Education and Science, we shall make similar representations to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)? I am sure that he will be outraged at the suggestion that he is hand in glove with the Secretary of State and accepts that the depreciation of the Secretary of State is sufficient force to do away with these abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may reintroduce similar amendments later, depending on the advice of the Secreary of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 145, in page 20 line 13, leave out from 'occurs' to end of line 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the duty to allocate seats to political groups. It would delete paragraph (e), which is another of those incredible provisions that the Government slip into nearly all Bills and almost all clauses. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at such other times as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It is obvious how such provisions get into Bills. When the Secretary of State draws up a politically motivated Bill to undermine local authority democracy and the Opposition parties, he goes through the arrangements that the Minister has just tried to defend and then he thinks, "I might not catch everything." or, "It might go against my party at some stage, so I had better write in a centralising power that enables me to step in whenever I want and make the decisions."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This paragraph is a nice bit of centralisation which is available to the Secretary of State to use as a club whenever he wishes. It is unacceptable, but it is in line with the way in which the Government operate, as we saw on the Housing Bill last year. These additional powers are handed to the Secretary of State on a plate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to make it clear that the Conservative party is a flexible, caring and listening party. We have received several representations on this matter. We must try to cover every contingency. If I catalogue some of the contingencies, I am sure that I will persuade the hon. Gentleman that he should not press the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A change in the balance of political power should be covered. The consequences of a by-election may have to be considered. What would happen if two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
political parties merged or de-merged? Two parties may not know whether they have merged or demerged—my remarks are clearly not directed at the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), although he probably knows what I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State wants to retain flexibility, I do too. That is as good a reason as any, so I recommend that either the hon. Member does not press the amendment to a Division or the Committee rejects it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That last remark hit the nail on the head. The Secretary of State wants it, so the Minister complies. I understand that logic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 21, line 33, after "applies", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the addition of parish and community councils,".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to extend requirements on the proportionality of committees to parish and community councils. I suspect that, for the vast majority of parish and community councils, the amendment is unneccesary because most such councils do not have committees and are not political, but there has been an increasing tendency among city and town councils to become more politicised, to take on more functions and to divide their duties into committee work. Where that happens, the same requrements on proportionality should be observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may need little persuading, as she has already put forward the same arguments for other councils. I hope that she will accept the amendment so that, where parish or community councils divide their responsibilities, they do so in a genuinely representative way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) shows that he supports the principle behind the clause. The Committee should bear that in mind when we reach the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not encourage my hon. Friend's to support the amendment, which would extend the scope of the political balance requirements to parish councils in England and to community councils in Wales. Although I entirely agree that, where a parish council is organised on party lines, it should abide by the spirit of the provisions, the phrase that comes to mind here is "taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut", as Opposition Members so often seek to do. If there is a proposal to which that phrase can be properly applied, it is this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 8,000 parish councils in England, and almost 800 community councils in Wales. Most are not organised on party lines, nor do people wish them to be. Most appoint committees only intermittently, if at all. We would impose an entirely unnecessary complication and an inappropriate system on such councils that would be out of proportion to their size and their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response has not come as a complete surprise but her political jibes were unnecessary on such an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's reply. Although the question does not arise in most councils, where it does it is important. The Minister acknowledged that some parish councils are politically controlled. That tendency is increasing. However, as we are now progressing at the rate of a formula 1 car, I shall not take up more of the committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 21, line 34, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Sections 13 and 14 above shall not apply to appointments made by a relevant authority or committee of a relevant authority to any body established by that authority where the powers of that body are restricted to decisions solely affecting a limited geographical sub-division of that authority and the appointment to seats on that body is limited only to the elected members representing electoral areas (wards or divisions), situated entirely within that geographical sub-division.".</p></blockquote>
I shall not go into the wording of the amendment in detail because I want to deal with the main issue, which will be of immediate relevance to some members of the Committee. It may be unusual in metropolitan areas, but not in rural district areas, to divide planning issues on the basis of the location that they will affect so that committees represent the councillors of that area and are not divided in proportion to the make-up of the council. In rural areas, the council can cover such a wide area geographically that it is appropriate to divide it in such a way as to allow councillors with an immediate, intimate knowledge of the area to take planning decisions, which are essentially non-political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle is not enshrined in Restormel district council in my constituency. Groups in St. Austell, particularly the chamber of commerce, have pressed for a greater contribution from the councillors who represent St. Austell rather than those who represent Newquay, which is a considerable distance away and has entirely different interests. The Action 2000 group has suggested splitting the committee between Restormel and Newquay. As all St. Austell councillors are Social and Liberal Democrats, that would affect the political composition of the committee. Given the way in which the district works, it would probably not affect planning decisions, which are not made on political grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the legislation would not enable a council to reflect in its committees the balance of members representing an area. It also has implications for the experimental neighbourhood councils in Tower Hamlets, which give direct power to people who represent a particular area. It is probably the only area in which Opposition councillors effectively control a budget of millions of pounds. Neighbourhood councils, like district councils, give power to those most involved in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
immediate community. The Tower Hamlets experiment is important and innovative. It has created considerable national interest among those involved in the running of councils and its results are becoming apparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is correct to say that I basically support the principles behind clause 13. However, the Bill should ensure that the views of people representing a particular area are taken into account when decisions that will affect only that area are made. That is the aim of the amendment. It refers to the circumstances in which not only the body but its powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"are restricted to decisions solely affecting a limited geographical sub-division".</p></blockquote>
That appears to be within the bounds of the Bill's intentions. It will be reflected in the district councils of some members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will consider the amendment sympathetically and I look forward to the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) convinces me that more work needs to be done, and it is a crying shame that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is not here to hear me say that. I want to make it abundantly clear that we are here to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Truro said and I found many of his arguments compelling. We would certainly have to consider the matter by way of regulations, and I accept entirely that we would have to come up with something a little more precise on the constitution of the committees. Therefore, I seek to convince him that if we were to enter into consultation with the local authority associations, we should include an exemption in paragraph 1 of schedule 1. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be absurd for me not to accept the Minister's assurance. I hope that before the end of the legislative process, he will be able to clarify in more detail—perhaps by letter—what he proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends. At the speed with which the Committee is moving, I might not have the time to consult the local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's comment. Perhaps we had better put the brakes on the formula 1 car as we swing into the hairpin bend and the Government accept an amendment. I welcome the Minister's assurances, and I hope that he will keep me and other members of the Committee in touch with progress on the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me try my luck now. I might be able to encourage the Minister and to take him with me. The amendment inserts the word "reasonable" into the provision that enables a group to have the allocations that it wants on its committee. I draw the Minister's attention to the notes on clauses, which explain that clause 14 provides that where a person has been appointed to a body in accordance with the wishes of a political group under subsection (1), that enables the party to terminate that appointment. I am not objecting to that—I understand what the Minister is seeking to do there. Once the Government have embarked on the process that they have adopted, that step becomes necessary.

However, there is an advantage in including the word "reasonable", because the action might be taken in a way that is damaging to local authorities generally. I shall give some examples of where a problem might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the member concerned was investigating what he or she believed to be a serious matter of corruption in the local authority, and if that was becoming embarrassing to some members of his or her own party, whichever party that was, and the party chose to remove that member from the committee, that would be unreasonable and could be interpreted at law as being unreasonable. However, if the party decided to turf that person off because he or she was no longer turning up or was not doing his or her job, or if that person simply wanted to serve on another committee, that would obviously be perfectly reasonable and one could not stop it at law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I warn the Minister that on the rare occasions where corruption creeps in, we need someone to be able to retain a seat on a committee if he or she has it on a reasonable basis. The law is used to taking into account the concept of reasonableness and I am not in any way trying to remove the right to take a person off a committee for whatever reason the party desires. As a general rule, it will be because they want to move a person from one committee to another committee, or the person might simply want to come off a committee. A number of similar situations are perfectly proper, and my amendment would not stop people moving in those circumstances. Instead, it would provide a safeguard that could be tested out at law if a person felt that he or she was being removed unreasonably. The Minister should bear in mind cases where a member of a committee is investigating corruption and embarrassing his colleagues because of that investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not expect the hon. Gentleman to acknowledge publicly that I have a point, but nevertheless, I put it to him that his interpretation of what is reasonable is not necessarily mine. Indeed, his interpretation of what is reasonable may not be the interpretation of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to concede that in this matter the courts have a dreadful and difficult job. I am equally convinced that magistrates of the lower court, and county court and High Court judges would not thank Members of Parliament or our noble Friends in the other place for including "reasonable". I am the first to admit that the word is sprinkled through the statute book in various Acts of Parliament, but I do not find it easy to accept it as it is used in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister mentioned me as a possible source of disagreement, I should like to say that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because at this time of night I am trying to be reasonable, I am prepared to say that if we believe that further controls are necessary, we can include them in paragraph (3) of schedule 1. I think that it is a recipe for disaster, although that is not to say that I shall not consider it. I understand the hon. Gentleman's examples, but the Committee proceedings would be delayed ad infinitum, and I have no doubt court proceedings would be delayed ad infinitum, as we debated the interpretation or misinterpretation of "reasonable". I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel it wise to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not claiming that the amendment is beautifully drafted to cover the examples that I have given, but the Minister should bear in mind that someone can remain a member of a committee, carry out his work and, as it is not unknown in the history of local government, uncover something important. That discovery could alienate his party colleagues, and it cannot be in the interests of better local government to give the party the power to put the person off a committee for any reason whatever. There may be times when it could be in the interests of good local government for that person to stay off. I have my battles with the courts about the way that they interpret some legislation, but on matters of this nature, they often interpret "reasonable" quite well. Perhaps there should be another form of wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should bear in mind that he is saying to any political party that it can chuck someone off regardless of the reason. That is a serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the example of a political group or an individual operating with a corrupt motive, the power in the Bill would enable the court to restrain the group or the individual.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like further clarification. I am not sure how it could do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
Suppose that a member is beavering away and believes that he had found evidence of corruption on the committee on which he serves. There may not be enough evidence to put before a court or to bring out in another way, but he may be on to something which suggests corrupt practice. Moreover, suppose that the people who seek to cover that up say, "Get that person off the committee." I do not believe that the Bill covers that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that under paragraph 3 of schedule 1 we could include in the regulations sufficient controls to cover such a possibility, if we considered that desirable. I do not give that undertaking because, as the hon. Gentleman must realise, I am most unhappy about, and shall resist, the insertion of the word "reasonable" in the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. I do not wish to press the matter and shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, but the Minister should reconsider. The corruption example is the best that I can give, but there are others. Someone might hold a particular view about race that clashed with the views of the other members; they might get fed up with that person arguing the case for ethnic minorities and so want him off the committee. Many things could go badly wrong. Corruption is the obvious example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the word "reasonable" would not drive home my point. At present, a member can stay on such a committee for as long as he can retain that position through the normal party mechanisms. That works tolerable well. The Minister's proposals would mean that someone could be taken off "just like that", without it being any great problem. Moreover that might disadvangage the better running of local authorties.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I know what the answer to the amendment will be. In one of the Minister's disarming acts of honesty—to which I shall occasionally refer during our proceedings—he said, "It is in there because the Secretary of State wants it in there." That will be the answer. It is exactly the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must get the words absolutely right. I hope that I shall do so. I shall read the record. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State requires that power and I think that he should have it. That is a rather different interpretation from the the hon. Gentleman's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall check the wording tomorrow. But I think that the Minister said that it is in there because the Secretary of State wants it in there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to this provision. The Secretary of State is being given the power to regulate the appropriate representation on sub-committees. That is spelt out quite well in the notes on clauses. It is an amazing power. It will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations about who can or cannot serve on a particular sub-committee. It is unnecessary to give such an enormous power to a Minister and it does not encourage good local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment related to the last in a series of clauses which are designed to help local authorities to recognise and come to terms with the growing existence of party politics and the need to accommodate such politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe report noted that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"politics is now the main determining factor in the decisions of most local authorities. It is however not recognised in the statutory arrangements and is often regarded as an alien presence."</p></blockquote>
Widdicombe said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the political process, instead of fitting into a regulated framework within the local government system, is tending to operate outside and at odds with the system. At best this is causing uncertainty and instability. At worst power is being abused."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the clauses are designed to ensure that local authorities allocate seats on committees, and make appointments to outside bodies, in proportion to the balance of political groups on the council so that minority parties are able to be properly represented on committees and to play a full role in the council's decision-making process. Taken together with the voting rights of the co-opted committee members, they will prevent the majority parties from being able to use their majorities on the council to influence committee membership in their favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would delete clause 15(3). The hon. Gentleman has expressed anxiety about the subsection. It must be examined within the context of the Bill. The Bill covers not only the ordinary committees of local authorities, but some of the less usual ones. The common feature of the latter is that they are joint bodies, appointed by county councils in conjunction with some other authority. Police committees are appointed by county councils and magistrates, jointly; sea fisheries committees are appointed by county councils, some metropolitan district councils and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, jointly; national parks committees are appointed by my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales, and by county councils and district councils, jointly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
Legally, these bodies are committees of the county councils but, unsually, the powers are vested in the committees, not in the local authority. They are the bodies with which the subsection deals. Because of their joint nature and their special statutory status, the provisions needed to apply the principle of pro rata representation to the sub-committees appointed by these committees are more complicated. Rather than make the clauses more difficult to follow, we thought it right to put the provisions into regulations. We shall, of course, consult on the regulations but, given the limited scope of what is needed, regulations did seem an appropriate method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in the light of that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support that I should be grateful for small mercies. I recognise that the Minister has paid something that is, for the Conservative party, novel. She has recognised that politics have come into local government. You will remember, Sir Anthony, that the Conservative party resisted that notion for many years through the device of a fancy dress system whereby people called themselves Independents when they were Conservatives. It took me a long time to appreciate that that is why the Conservative party likes fancy dress parties. At the end of the day, Joe Stalin must have been a Young Conservative, because he knew how to control the situation, without appearing to be what he was.
