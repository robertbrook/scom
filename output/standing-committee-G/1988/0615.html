	<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not such description is general in terms".</p></blockquote>
It would probably help the Committee if I said at the outset that this afternoon we hope to put into legislation a series of recommendations arising from the Keith committee. We were able to discuss the principles involved in this series of clauses in a brief debate in the Chamber on clause 138, which has already been agreed to. I see no reason to trawl through that again. Instead, I hope that we can move through these clauses in a workmanlike way and bring this part of the Bill to a rapid conclusion. As I said on Second Reading, the Opposition are in favour of implementing the recommendations of the Keith committee. If there is any resistance, it will not be from the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment No. 419 is designed to explore the Government's thinking on the main clause, which sets out the descriptions of documents that can be called for by the Revenue. We wonder how explicit the description has to be. It is a straightforward point. We simply seek to ensure that the Revenue is not denied access to a document simply because it has been described in terms that are too general. I am fairly certain that the Government do not intend to allow such a loophole, but I should like to explore with the Financial Secretary the mechanisms that the Government have in place to prevent that. It might be possible to describe a document as a sale contract between X and Y. It may be that the Revenue can only be general in its request, and we should not wish it to be denied access to the papers of a tax accountant because the test was too narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed further it might be helpful if I reported to the Committee now that, following consultations through the usual channels, the Committee will sit next Tuesday in Committee Room 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) for explaining the purpose of the amendment. As he said, the principles of the Keith report were discussed when clause 138 was debated in the Chamber. In these first few clauses today, we are debating the information powers of the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 138 introduces new safeguards for the taxpayer under the Revenue's powers to call for information in the course of inquiries into a person's tax affairs. The new safeguards protect personal records and journalistic material from disclosure to the Revenue and ensure that the Revenue allows not less than 30 days for the papers to be delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under a separate information power, the Revenue can call for the papers of a tax accountant who has been convicted of a tax offence. The purpose of this clause is to give the public the same new safeguards under this power as they are given under clause 138 in respect of the more general powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will wish to ensure that the same safeguards ae available under both those provisions, and therefore that the clause mirrors the words in the previous clause. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to amend clause 139 and to add words that do not appear in clause 138. However, that is obviously a minor point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow notices to be given in general terms. A notice puts a legal obligation on the recipient, and he can be penalised if he fails to meet it. It is clearly right that a notice must therefore be sufficiently specific in its terms for the person to know what is required, and that is the effect of the present law. It would not be appropriate to allow notices to be given in any more general terms than is posible under the present law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that explains how the powers would work and why notices will be required to be in specific terms. We have discussed and shall discuss what will be excluded from those powers. Obviously, it will be possible to ask for working papers that are relevant to the inquiries that are being made under the provisions, provided that they do not fall in the exempt categories. However, the notice itself will have to be specific, and it can be specific except in so far as the items that have already been mentioned are excused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with many of these proposals, we shall have to see how the provisions work out in practice. I accept that to allow notices to be made in general terms is probably going too wide, as the Financial Secretary said. The purpose of our amendment was to explore precisely what the Government intended by the phrase "specific terms". I have listened carefully to what the Financial Secretary has said and although I suspect that we may retrun to the subject in the future, in the circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTIONS ON POWERS UNDER TMA SS.20 AND 20A</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 420, in page 105, line 15, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and for "6" there shall be substituted "12".'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to section 20B of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Subsection (5) states that a person or company who has been carrying on a business is not obliged to make a document available if it originates more than six years before the date of the notice requiring it. Our amendment is intended to explore with the Government why the provision of six years is set out. Our amendment would extend the period to 12 years, the rationale being that in many instances significant Inland Revenue inquiries can take a long time to come to fruition and can extend back for many years. It is our fear—I hope that the Financial Secretary can meet it—that six years may be unduly restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 140 has two purposes. First, it requires the Revenue to inform taxpayers that it is seeking documents from a third party and secondly, it makes changes to the professional privilege for tax accountants, aligning it with that of lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) has put forward a case for increasing the power of the Revenue to call for documents that are more than six years old, and he is saying that that period could be increased to 12 years. The power that the Revenue has is subject to several important safeguards to ensure that it cannot be used in an unreasonable or oppressive fashion, and to prevent any unnecessary or excessive invasion of privacy. The Revenue is allowed to call for documents that are more than six years old only where there are reasonable grounds for believing that tax has been lost through fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's suggestion would be seen as oppressive. This clause, like the other clauses that are subject to consultation, has been supported generally by the professions. The existing limit of six years corresponds to the normal limits in general law, for instance under the statute of limitations, and also to the normal time limit under tax law for assessing tax, except where tax is lost through a default by the taxpayer. So, in general, we do not go back more than six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no statutory limit on how far back the Revenue can go when it calls for information from the taxpayer himself—we shall discuss that point later. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. But it is reasonable that there should be a proper limit where the Revenue calls for information from a third party. One of the major issues is that we are talking about information from a third party. It is not just a matter of putting an obligation and the compliance burden on the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present limit of six years allows the Revenue access to information that it could reasonably require in the normal course of inquiries. That is the Revenue's view and it is also my view. It is also reasonable that it should be overridden where
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
serious offences may be involved. To extend the limit to 12 years when third parties are involved would be imposing on others an unnecessary obligation and would be seen as unnecessarily oppressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment was to explore the Government's thinking behind the six-year period.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 421, in page 105, line 24, after 'behalf', insert 'solely'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 423, in page 105, line 26, leave out "and" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"but not until such enactments are supplemented or amended to provide an auditor with a statutory obligation to notify the Board if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence involving any form of fraud in connection with, or in relation to, tax has been committed which has come to his attention during the ordinary cause of his duties as an auditor".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 422, in page 105, line 26, at end insert</p>
	<br><blockquote><p>"have not been used for any other purpose, and".</p></blockquote>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with a more substantial point. The issue at stake is the obligation to deliver documents that are the property of an auditor and created by him in the course of his duties. The amendment seeks to ensure that that cannot be used as a cloak to cover documents used also for other purposes, so that under the guise of audit papers, which are generally the property of the auditor and not the company being audited, documents cannot defeat the purpose of any notice under the relevant sections. We touched on that significant point on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 423 deals with the same issue, but in a different way. An auditor should have a statutory obligation to notify a tax fraud, which he has reasonable ground for suspecting if his attention has been drawn to it during his work for a particular client. There should be what is colloquially called a whistle-blowing requirement on auditors when they discover something which in the reasonable exercise of professional judgment, looks like a tax fraud. I understand that there is provision at the moment for auditors appointed in connection with banking regulatory requirements to have direct discussions with the Bank of England when they discover banking crimes. Amendment No. 423 seeks to extend that principle and provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our suggestion is not considered appropriate, the problem could be tackled in several ways. For example, we could call for changes in company law to require that an auditor's certificate must state specifically that the audit has revealed nothing that causes him to suspect that a tax fraud has been committed by the company, although there could be opposition to that on the ground that it would hurt the auditor-client relationship. However, the concession that auditors' papers are to be treated as privileged in the same way that the relationship between a solicitor and his client is privileged will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
help to protect the auditor-client relationship. It is a major concession to the accountancy profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such concessions are to be made and emphasised, surely it is also right to emphasise the accountancy profession's obligations, in its professional ethics and standards, to the Inland Revenue. We touched on that on Second Reading and I repeat that I am not sure that the analogy between the accountancy and the legal professions is applicable in all aspects. A solicitor's belief in his client's innocence in a criminal case is ultimately tested in an adversarial system in the courts, but an accountant's certification of his client's books or accounts for the year may be all that the Revenue has to go on when assessing whether more tax is due. After all, the Revenue does not have the resources to conduct a detailed investigation into every commercial undertaking, year in, year out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing that accountants have no obligation to their clients or that in all circumstances their obligation should be suppressed in the interests of the Revenue, because that would be nonsense, but a balance should be struck. By protecting, through privilege, accountants' working papers, a major concession has been made. That should be balanced by an obligation to the Revenue, which should be at least as strong as the professional obligations that all professions emphasise when their independence is challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult issue, which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) raised on the Floor of the House. Although it is a difficult decision, my own view is that it would be wrong to go as far as the hon. Gentleman wishes. He suggests that the protection given to auditors' working papers that relate wholly and exclusively to the audit should be restricted. That is not sensible. An auditor will, not uncommonly, provide other services to the company and its shareholders. It may be difficult to say whether a paper relates wholly and exclusively to the audit, and it would be unreasonable to breach the proper duty of confidentiality owed by the auditor because some of his papers served a dual purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Protection is open to misuse and the hon. Gentleman made the point that, by giving protection to audit working papers, we might be inviting taxpayers or auditors to hide information from the Revenue by dressing it up as part of the audit working papers. But we have taken steps in the provision to prevent that happening by allowing the Revenue access to information that it really needs even if it is to be found only in the audit working papers. There is a specific provision in the clause allowing the Revenue access to fact, showing how a figure in the accounts or in the return has been arrived at, even if it is available only in the audit papers. So a balance has been struck and the position of the Revenue has been safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not go so far as the hon. Gentleman and agree that auditors should be put under a statutory
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
obligation to report evidence of tax fraud to the Revenue. That would be in clear breach of the duty of confidentiality incumbent upon auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also have the undesirable effect of making it more difficult for the auditors to carry out his proper function of protecting the interests of shareholders, as its main effect would be to encourage a dishonest director to go to greater lengths to conceal matters. The issue is difficult, but on balance the arguments weigh against the hon. Gentleman. It would be a highly controversial step to impose such an obligation on auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that these are matters of balance. Nevertheless, if auditors, who are professionals, discover evidence of fraud, which is a crime, they should be under a duty to blow the whistle. We shall have to see how such propositions work in practice and I am happy to see how the proposals bed themselves into British tax law. Therefore, I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 424, in page 105, line 39, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and who fulfills the requirements of subsection (10)(A) below:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(10)(A) A tax adviser fulfills the requirements of this subsection if such advisers subscribes to a National Code of Conduct agreed between the Board and relevant professional bodies, and where this Code includes, inter alia, the understanding to disloss where the benefit of the doubt has been taken by the taxpayer in the submission of Returns and Computation.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to qualify the new subsection (9)(b) of section 20B of the Taxes Management Act 1970. That exempts from the obligation to deliver certain documents, a tax adviser in respect of items that are his property and which consist of communications giving advice on tax affairs. It would not extend to documents that are not his property but simply lodged with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tax adviser means any person appointed to give tax advice about the affairs of another and could range from the professionally-qualified to those who are unqualified. However, it could be argued that a qualification does not guarantee a level of integrity. But the rules of a profession should act as a safeguard and because they come from an institution could have some effect. Nevertheless, we should be concerned about the wide protection of documents of both qualified and unqualified advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to allow exemption only to those tax advisers who fulfil the requirements that they are subscribers to a national code of conduct. The code could be agreed between the Board of Inland Revenue and relevant professions. The idea would include an undertaking to disclose where the benefit of doubt has been taken by the taxpayer in the submissions of returns and computations. That returns us to our point about whistle-blowing, although it will not be a statutory obligation. That is important because when a set of tax computations are submitted by a tax adviser on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
behalf of his client, a position is often taken on the deductability of an item which is, at best, marginal under the rules. Unless the inspector of taxes picks the particular submission for detailed scrutiny, it would effectively go through on the nod. That is made worse by reports of substantial understaffing in the Inland Revenue, as we mentioned in the debate on the Floor of the House. That pertains especially to London and to the south-east of England. A code of conduct could be a great help when dealing with compliance lapses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a huge explosion in the tax industry since 1979 under a regime which the Financial Secretary often tells us is supposed to be a low-tax one. We are arguing that under this type of arrangement the balance between the Revenue and the taxpayer is now weighted too favourably towards the taxpayer. Surely only those with something to fear from subscribing to a national code could object to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). This is a useful amendment. There is a case for arguing that the Inland Revenue needs all the assistance that it can get in recouping the various tax receipts owing to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to step back a bit to see the ultimate relevance of the stipulation made by the amendment. The annual report of the Board of Inland Revenue shows that the costs of administration for the Inland Revenue service in terms of income tax receipts is almost £1 billion. That is an enormous sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparing for this Committee, I have been going through a book which is most helpful to Back Benchers like me—Kay and King's "The British Tax System". It points out that the collection costs for income tax in the United Kingdom as a proportion of the income tax receipts are four times what they are in the United States. I understand that there has not been much progress on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary shakes his head, but I have taken those figures from Kay and King. I have tabled a question on that matter which I hope will produce the latest comparative results. I do not have up-to-date figures. However, the collection costs for the income tax service in the UK is about 2 per cent. of the income tax receipts. That has been the position for some years, and it is still the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other services seem to manage much more efficiently. That is why we should accept amendments that would give the Inland Revenue every assistance possible in pursuing the tax owing to it. If, as Kay and King's book says, collection costs in the UK are four times what they are in the USA, it means that three quarters of a billion pounds is theoretically wasted on unnecessary administration costs. Three quarters of a billion pounds could do a lot of good in other areas of public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
Does the Financial Secretary accept that criticism of the Inland Revenue's administrative efficiency? If so, has he a target for improving efficiency? We understand that there is a process of computerisation in train for pay-as-you-earn, and it would be interesting to find out the latest position on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd that the Government should be so eager to criticise what they regard as the inefficiencies of the National Health Service—which by international standards is extremely efficient—and yet do nothing to correct the inefficiencies of the Inland Revenue system which, by international standards, is extremely inefficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment covers similar ground to that of amendment No. 421. The subject was discussed by the Keith committee. The amendment would introduce, by another route, the committee's recommendation that there should be a statutory obligation to draw to the inspector's attention all occasions when, in making a return, the taxpayer takes the benefit of any doubt on whether any item ought to be declared, or any relief for deduction allowed.

The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) may know that that recommendation was strongly criticised as being burdensome and inequitable. It would require the taxpayer, on pain of penalty, to draw the inspector's attention to any item on which there could be any doubt as to the correct tax treatment. Taken literally, that could include nearly every entry in the accounts of a business. In the light of the strong representations, we rejected that approach. Instead, the Revenue has tried to approach the problem through clear explanations in the notes with the return, telling the taxpayer what to do if he has doubts and inviting him to express any doubts and to provide any other information which he thinks may be relevant. The hon. Gentleman may know that there have been changes in the presentation of tax returns and new corporation tax returns. That has been widely welcomed and helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee returned to the subject in volume 3 of its report and emphasised that the intention was to secure disclosure of relevant facts rather than a declaration of doubts. I am satisfied that the approach that we have adopted to help the taxpayer to resolve any doubts and difficulties is the better way to approach this, and comes nearest to the Keith committee's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's proposal would be extremely bureaucratic and regulatory. A requirement to draw the inspector's attention to any item where the benefit of doubt has been taken by the taxpayer would be impracticable. On the more general question on the code of conduct, the Government believe more in self-regulation than statutory prescription. But the practicability of the matter is my main argument.

The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) made some general comments on the

	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
efficiency of the Revenue, the cost of collection and the support required by the Revenue. He said that I shook my head when he drew a comparison with the United States. I have not read the study to which he referred, but I was shaking my head only because it is extremely difficult to compare the costs of the Internal Revenue Service with those of the Inland Revenue. Many of the costs, which in the United States are borne by the general public and individual taxpayers, are borne by the Inland Revenue in this country. I believe that we have an efficient Revenue machine for bringing in the revenue. It is difficult to draw comparisons between the United States and this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Sandford of Bath university considered the compliance costs of our system vis-a-vis the compliance costs of other systems throughout the world. He concluded that the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers in this country compared favourably. That is the other side of the coin and underlines my comment to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East on the difficulty. It is necessary to consider the cost of the tax-collecting machine and the compliance costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other side of the coin is that because we do not have a system of separate assessment, much of the cost falls on employers. In the United States the costs are heavier for individual taxpayers, but in this country the costs are heavier for employers. Approximately the same number of people are required in the Internal Revenue Service in the United States as in the Inland Revenue but we employ four times the number of tax inspectors per taxpayer compared with the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) have not undermined my point or the basis on which the comparison must be made. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we have targets for the cost of collection and individual taxes. We have a myriad of different targets. If he wishes, I can send him the Inland Revenue's departmental statement, in which I take a close interest. It sets out unit costs, productivity targets and performance indicators for its divisions and individual taxes. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we pay close attention to such aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other occasions, we have debated the measures that are being and have been taken to deal with the loss of inspectors and the switching of resources within the Revenue. I accept that I am going rather wide of the amendment, but, when we debated clause 138, I outlined to the House what many of those measures were. They are effective, I believe that such sensible measures can counteract many of the difficulties that the Revenue faces because it is competing for scarce skills with people who can afford to pay much higher salaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the amendment goes against the original spirit of the Keith committee's recommendations. We are seeking to put the obligation on the taxpayer's professional adviser, not on the taxpayer. If we are,
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
by statute, to give privileges and protections to taxpayers' professional advisers, it is reasonable to place certain obligations on them, too. The Financial Secretary said that such an obligation would be highly bureaucractic and cumbersome. I am not sure that I agree. After all, the professional adviser will have trawled through all the figures and their accompanying facts to which the amendment refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligation that we seek to put on the professional adviser is that, when he discovers that his client has taken the benefit of the doubt when making a submission to the Inland Revenue, it should be flagged up. That would amount to no more than putting an asterisk beside specific points in the submission or flagging up in a more professional way the work that the professional adviser had done already. I do not understand how such an obligation would be burdensome or bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways in which to approach the issue: either to put an obligation on professional advisers or to employ more tax inspectors so that they have a better chance of discovering such factors themselves. I fear that the Government will take neither course. However, as we said when debating similar amendments, it is right to give the effects of the Keith committee proposals time to bed themselves in to our legislation. Therefore, I shall not press the amendment to a Division at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 432, in page 105, line 45, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"but nothing in this subsection shall apply to any part of any document which contains the opinion of the adviser or an explanation by him of his opinion.".</p></blockquote>
I tabled this amendment jointly with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and it seeks to confine the effect of new subsection (11) of section 20B of the Taxes Management Act 1970 to the factual part—that is the key point—of documents containing advice from tax advisers. The Committee will be aware that clause 140 introduces a new type of qualified protection for advice given in relevant communications by a tax adviser to a taxpayer. It is similar to but not identical with legal privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that it is not clear how the clause will operate in practice and how the advice or opinion of a tax adviser can remain protected in a typical case. Surely, the protection ought to cover the opinion given by a tax adviser even though it explains a return made by a taxpayer. At most, all that should be available to the Revenue is that part of a document which sets out what a given transaction is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment probes that uncertainty and seeks to ensure that the advice or opinion part of a tax adviser's letter of document can be severed from its factual part before it is shown to the Revenue. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton and I tabled the amendment to obtain an on-the-record explanation and I hope that we shall be given it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I accept, as the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) said, that this is an exploratory amendment and it is obvious that he does not intend to press it to a vote, I hope that the Financial Secretary will resist it in any case. It is right that the Revenue should have not only the decision that was made but access to the thinking that lay behind that decision, and that should go fairly wide. It would have been more reasonable if the hon. Gentleman had said that there should be no access to working papers that referred to options that were considered but not decided upon. But when a decision has been made and acted upon, the justification for that decision should be available to the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Among other things, clause 140 introduces a more clearly focused protection for accountants. It gives them protection from Inland Revenue inquiries into their work for their clients which is broadly equivalent to that given to lawyers. This proposal, based on recommendations of the Keith committee, has been worked out in consultation with the representative bodies and has been widely supported by such organisations as the Institute of Taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly speaking, the approach which has been agreed with the representative bodies and which is followed in this clause is, first, to protect the duty of confidentiality which a tax adviser owes to his client or an auditor owes to the company and its shareholders, by protecting tax advice and audit papers from disclosure by an accountant to the Revenue, and, secondly, to allow the Revenue access to linking papers—that is the parts of an accountant's working papers which show how he arrived at an entry in a client's return or accounts from the prime records—where this is necessary in the course of inquiries into the client's tax affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision includes important safeguards for the taxpayer to ensure that the Revenue is allowed access to an accountant's working papers only where, and to the extent that, this is really necessary. I understand the point that worries my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), and the purpose of this amendment is to establish that the Revenue's right of access to parts of the working papers is limited to questions of fact and does not extend to questions of opinion. For example, it does not extend to tax advice. To put it another way, the Revenue can require an accountant to show how he arrived at an entry in a client's return or accounts from the prime records, but not why. I can give my hon. Friend and the representative bodies who have asked for confirmation on this point a firm assurance that that is the effect of the provision as drafted, and that the amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"or which relates to any particulars which he has been required to make available under section 20 above".</p></blockquote>
We have reached a different topic, as you may or may not be relieved to hear, Mr. Crowther. We have tabled two amendments on the subject, the second being amendment No. 426.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 425 seeks to clarify the definitions in the clause, which deals with falsification and destruction of documents. We wish to affirm that the offence would extend to the destruction or falsification of documents relating to any particulars that had been requested under section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he always does, the Financial Secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but, as I understand it, the clause deals only with documents and notices that relate to particulars. We would like it to go a little wider, or to hear from the Financial Secretary details of exactly what is covered by the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 141 deals with assessments founded on fraudulent or negligent conduct and introduces a criminal sanction against the intentional falsification or destruction of a document which the Revenue has called for under the information powers already dealt with. This brings these safeguards under the Revenue's information powers into line with similar provisions in other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes too far and would make it a criminal offence for a taxpayer who had been required to answer questions put to him under a formal notice to alter or dispose of any document which related to the information that he was required to provide. Furthermore—perhaps unintentionally—that would continue to apply until he had obtained written permission of a general or special commissioner, the inspector or an officer of the board to alter or dispose of the document. That would be criminalising what might be an innocent act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of all these provisions is to try to find a balance between the Revenue and safeguards for the taxpayer. We certainly do not wish to give the Revenue any powers greater than it needs to administer the Act effectively, nor to put the taxpayer under any greater liability to penalties than is necessary for him to be deterred from failing to comply with his obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To provide that one could not alter or dispose of a document that related to the information that had been required would be burdensome and we see no reason for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is unreasonable to require people to keep documents that they are already aware may be the subject of controversy. However, the Financial Secretary assures the Committee that the Inland Revenue already has sufficient powers to administer the Taxes Management Act effectively and suggests that I am going too far. I may be, but I promise not to do it today and so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 426, in page 107, line 9, leave out "two" and insert "six.".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to extend to six years the time during which the Board can make up its mind about whether it wants to notify a person who is in receipt of the relevant notice that the notice has been statutorily complied with. Some investigations are complex and take a long time to complete. We suggest six years, but the Financial Secretary may have an adequate explanation of the Government's proposed timescale and he may assure us that those are satisfactory to the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My response to this amendment is almost exactly the same as to the previous one. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Revenue is perfectly happy with the limit of two years. The clause makes it a criminal offence intentionally to falsify or destroy a document which the Revenue has called for, before the Revenue has seen it. It is clearly right that there should be some limitation to this provision. The clause provides a basis time limit of two years, but the hon. Gentleman may have missed the point that it allows the inspector to extend that when appropriate, by giving a further notice to the taxpayer. That would be a more appropriate way in which to deal with the point raised by the hon. Gentleman as it puts a realistic time limit on the criminal provision, which allowing it to be extended when necessary. In particular, when the Revenue has been provided with a copy, it allows the person to alter or dispose of the original after two years, which does not seem unreasonable to me unless the Revenue has given a further notice preventing him from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman believes in restained government. His amendment would require the person to preserve the original for six years even though the Revenue's inquiries might have ended long before then. The hon. Gentleman is reasonable and I am sure that on reflection he will agree that his amendment is slightly out of character.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendments Nos. 428, in page 107, line 46, leave out "Serious" and insert "material", and amendment No. 429, in page 108, line 5, leave out "Serious" and insert "material".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are right linked. The clause relates to circumstances in which a warrant can be obtained to enter premises to obtain documents and evidence regarding tax fraud. The clause will limit that to serious fraud, which is defined as that leading or
	<br><blockquote><p>"likely to lead, either to substantial financial gain"</p></blockquote>
or which is likely to seriously
	<br><blockquote><p>"prejudice … the proper assessment or collection of tax".</p></blockquote>
As drafted, that seems to be in line with Revenue practice. Our amendment to substitute the words "substantial" and "Serious" with the word "material" was tabled to explore the Government's definition of those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that "material" is a lesser qualification and could give enhanced opportunity for the use of such warrants. The Financial Secretary may have a different view, and we seek to explore that. The restricted opportunity for the Revenue to use those powers is in marked contrast to the powers given to social security investigators for tracking down far smaller sums of money. How does the Financial Secretary explain the Government's approach to the scale and money involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A search power involves a most unwelcome invasion of privacy. But it is necessary for the Revenue on some occasions. It has not been argued that the Revenue often needs them, or that it is seriously hampered. We are giving the Revenue all kinds of extra powers, such as calling for documents from third persons. This battery of clauses has to do with extra powers for the Revenue, but physical search powers are not as central an issue as the hon. Gentleman believes. They are used only sparingly, in the most serious of cases—a total of 13 occasions in the past four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee found no grounds for suggesting that the Revenue had abused its search powers but thought it important that everything should be done to ensure that the public were fully protected. I am sure that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) will agree with that. The Keith committee recommended that the use of the Revenue's search powers should be restricted to cases of serious fraud. It was recommended that "serious" should remain undefined, except to the extent that it was explained in the clause, it being left to the judge considering the application for the issue of the search warrant to decide whether the requisite degree of seriousness was present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Keith committee based that recommendation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, the Home Office consultative memorandum and the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill. The Royal Commission recommended that search powers should be restricted to serious offences, but that the degree of seriousness should be left undefined, to develop a judicial view. That precedent has been followed in legislation on police powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and mirrored in the powers for VAT. The clause brings the safeguards in Revenue powers into line with those just described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that a weaker test, based on material, should be sufficient to justify a search by the Revenue. That would be contrary to the recommendations of the Keith committee and the Royal Commission, giving the Revenue greater powers than are considered necessary either for the police or for VAT. That would be a highly controversial thing to do. It is not necessary and I have received no suggestions from the Revenue that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was intended to explore the Government's thinking behind the powers in the clause.

	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is concerned with the rights of the public to access to property seized in a search by an investigating authority. The principal legislation, laying down the rights of the public and the procedures to be followed, appears in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and relates to the search powers of the police. This clause, as I have already explained, follows the equivalent provisions under the police search powers and under the Customs and Excise search powers for VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The types of offences which are investigated using the search powers of the Inland Revenue can be of similar seriousness to ones investigated using the search powers by Customs and Excise and by the police. It is right and proper that the rights of the public to access to property seized under these powers should be the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, giving the same rights to the public
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
access to property seized under the search powers of the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the police has the advantage of clarity, avoiding misundersanding over the extent of those rights and confusion over the procedures to be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (8) of section 20CC, allows the officer in charge of the investigation to refuse access where he has reasonable grounds for believing that allowing access would prejudice the investigation of criminal proceedings. Identical provisions appear in other provisions to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision is very restricted. In simple terms, the effect of the legislation is that the item, or a copy, must be made available to the person from whom it was seized unless a very good case is made out for not doing so. Ultimately, it would be for the officer to satisfy an appropriate judicial authority that he had reasonable grounds for believing that access would prejudice the investigation or criminal proceedings. The judge would require a high standard of justification. In particular, this provision would not allow the officer to deny access on the grounds that access might prejudice an investigation or would inconvenience an investigation in some way. It must be stronger than that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) that clause 153 is important. It stems from computerisation of the Revenue. It removes the statutory de minimis limits which prevent supplements being paid on small repayments of tax and interest from being charged on small late payments of tax. The present statutory de minimis limits therefore avoid the administrative cost of calculating and paying small amounts of interest as it was felt that they were not appropriate to the Revenue's operating on a computerised basis. The reason is simply that statutory de minimis limits rapidly become outdated and, although it is intended, and expected, that these provisions will operate to the advantage of the taxpayer, we shall operate some de minimis amounts administratively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause allows the preent statutory de minimis limits to be removed as procedures for charging and paying interest are transferred to the new computer system. Interest will then be paid on late repayments without a de minimis limit. Demands for small amounts of interest on unpaid tax will, however, be prevented by administrative de minimis limits that can be more easily updated. The clause paves the way to further streamlining of the tax system through the introduction of new and more efficient accounting systems for the collection of tax. As I explained, we expect that the effect of this will be to benefit taxpayers in general. The changes in the clause will, in general, benefit them individually—the removal of the de minimis limits will always benefit them. The effect of the removal of statutory limits, where money is owed by the taxpayer, will depend upon the administrative limits used by the Revenue when the new system is introduced—perhaps in 1922. This will prevent demands for small amounts of interest on unpaid tax. However, I must make it clear that, in some cases, small amounts of interest will be charged jointly with larger amounts of tax, which would not be pursued under existing provisions. In general, we expect the measure to operate to the advantage of the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause allows interest to be charged from the normal due date, wherever tax is assessed late as a result of error or delay by the taxpayer. At present, interest is charged only if the taxpayer is negligent or fraudulent. If the mistake is accidental, no interest is due. The effect will be that a taxpayer who later completes his return incorrectly will gain over a taxpayer who completes his return correctly, or pays his tax on time. I do not suppose that this measure will be received like a dozen oysters, so I stress again that the provision is based on the Keith committee's recommenation because it thought that it was wrong and recommended that interest be charged to remove the advantage and to compensate the Exchequer for the delay. The basic philosophy is that interest is not a penalty—it merely puts the taxpayer who pays late, for whatever reason, into the same position as the taxpayer who settles his afairs in good time. This has been the subject of consultations. Most respondents agree that it is right to charge interest where tax is assessed late as a result of error or delay by the taxpayer, whatever its cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause streamlines the procedures for charging and collecting the default interest that is due where tax is assessed late as a result of a fault by the taxpayer. It relates only to the machinery; it does not affect the circumstances in which interest arises, the amount of the interest or the taxpayer's rights of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present a determination that default interest is due can be made formally only by the appeal commissioners, although in practice default interest may be included in a negotiated settlement. The formal procedure for determining that default interest is due is somewhat unwieldy. The Keith committee shared that view and recommended that the Revenue should be able to make a formal determination that default interest is due. The procedure would be similar to making an assessment to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause introduces the recommended streamlined procedure. Under the new system, an inspector or the board can make a formal determination that default interest is due. The determination will be similar to a notice of assessment. The taxpayer can appeal, if necessary to the commissioners, if he disputes the details of the charge or whether default interest is due. As with a tax assessment, there is a further right of appeal to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Keith also recommended that penalties should be determined in a similar fashion, and provisions for that procedure are introduced in clause 162.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause simplifies the procedure for collecting interest where tax is assessed late. In those circumstances the date that interest starts to run depends on whether the taxpayer or the Revenue is at fault. If the assessment is late as a result of a fault by the Revenue—for instance, because of delays in processing the taxpayer's return—interest starts to run from the date that the tax becomes due and payable under the late assessment. If the assessment is late as a result of a fault by the taxpayer—for instance, because his return was late or incorrect—interest starts to run from the earlier date that tax would have been due if it had been assessed at the proper time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not always clear which rules should apply when tax is assessed late. Under the present procedures, no interest can be charged until that has been resolved, which can lead to delays and anomalies in the collection of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause simplifies the procedures, by allowing interest to be charged from the date that the tax is due under the late assessment in the first instance. If it subsequently turns out that interest should run from the earlier date that the tax would have been due if it had been assessed at the proper time, the extra interest that would be due can then be charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SURRENDER OF COMPANY TAX REFUND ETC WITHIN GROUP</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to the new scheme for charging and collecting corporation tax, known as pay and file. When we introduced the legislation two years ago, we said that pay and file would not come into effect until 1992—a significant year—at the earliest. I announced in April this year that, because of the need to take on board changes in the tax system such as independent taxation, pay and file would not begin before 1993 at the earliest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a relieving provision. Interest rates under pay and file will be set in line with the market, charging interest on unpaid tax at an average cost of borrowing, and paying interest on repayments at an average return on deposits. The provision is needed to avoid distortion to the flow of moneys between the Exchequer and the corporate sector, and to prevent round-tripping. If we had no interest differential
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
after pay and file, it would be easy for people to make a turn by simply delaying their payment of tax. The rate charged on late payments will therefore be higher than the rate paid on overpayments, just as the rates charged on borrowing in the market are higher than the rate paid on deposits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is a relieving provision in that it provides groups of companies with a safeguard against interest charges where there is no net underpayment across the group as a whole. Where one company has paid too much, and another too little, it allows the overpayment to be transferred without interest running either way. Without that safeguard, there would be a net cost to the group as interest would be charged on the underpayment at a higher rate than was paid on the overpayment. The clause also allows groups to rearrange their tax liabilities to make the best use of their available reliefs without exposing the groups to the net costs that would otherwise result from the differential in the interest rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In it, we update, simplify and streamline the system of money penalties for tax offences, resulting in a simpler system of penalties that can be applied easily and fairly so that offences of similar seriousness are treated with equal justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reforms are based on the recommendations of the Keith committee, modified in the light of subsequent consultations. The main recommendations have been accepted in deciding the range and level of penalties for each offence. Some penalties had been seriously eroded through inflation and are being increased to restore their value. Other penalties are too high and are reduced to a realistic level. The jumble of different penalties is rationalised and codified. The majority of tax offences are divided into three classes, with a single penalty for each class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only automatic penalties under the new proposals, on the lines of those that we have for value added tax, are for late returns on PAYE. We shall be debating those penalties on an amendment to be moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), but they will not be introduced until 1995, after a gradual tightening up after a transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed proposals for those reforms were published in a consultative paper, and they were widely welcomed. Much as we might wish for a tax system in which there was no need for penalties, it is accepted that it is necessary to have a sensible system of realistic penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general answer is that it is quite usual to bring changes to management provisions into effect either from Royal Assent or, where appropriate, from a later date such as the start of the following tax year. That is what has happened in the past, and it is clearly right that Parliament should have the opportunity to review legislation before it takes effect. That is not always possible, as we have discovered with some tax changes that have to be made earlier or brought into effect from the beginning of the tax year so that they can apply or give relief for the year as a whole. But that is what has usually happened with management changes. Others take effect from the date on which they are announced, to avoid forestalling.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 434, which I tabled with my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), is a probing amendment. It seeks to make the penalty mitigable rather than non-mitigable. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury may well reassure me that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that I may reassure him. As he knows, the subject has been much debated. It was debated in relation to VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Penalties in the tax system take two forms. They can be automatic and applied if there is a failure, or variable depending on the severity of the offence. In the previous clauses where we have been concerned with penalties for tax evasion, the penalties have been capable of being varied. This clause deals with PAYE—delays by employers in making their end-of-year return of the tax that they have deducted from the salaries and wages of their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
To draw the distinction, automatic penalties have an important role in any self-assessment type of tax. Where a taxpayer is allowed to work out and pay his tax by himself, it is especially important that he makes his return to the Revenue at the proper time so that it can check whether he has paid his tax correctly and take appropriate action if he has not. The only practicable way in which to ensure that returns are made at the proper time is to charge penalties without fail if they are not. That can be done efficiently and effectively only if the penalties are calculated and charged automatically, leaving no room for argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Automatic penalties are a common feature of self-assessment systems throughout the world. As I said, we introduced them for VAT in 1985 and for pay and file in 1987, which is a self-assessment system for corporation tax. The other major self-assessment system is PAYE. It is logical as there are automatic penalties for VAT there should be automatic penalties for PAYE too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore—and I made this point to my hon. Friend when debating another clause—we are proposing to ease employers into the new regime through a gradual tightening up over a five-year transitional period, which will help them to get up to speed first. The clause provides that automatic penalties will not be introduced before 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments in favour of mitigable penalties, which applied in the previous clauses, do not run here where we are dealing with regulatory offences; as I said, we are dealing with the self-assessment type of tax system. Mitigable penalties for late personal tax returns provide the flexibility needed to allow longer filing periods for more complex returns, anything from 30 days to two years according to the case. Mitigable penalties for incorrect returns provide the flexibility needed to deal with a very wide range of culpability. Neither of those factors is relevant here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that many peopple will be releived that we decided not to have a system of automatic penalties for personal tax returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is in any case a sense in which even automatic penalties can be varied with circumstances. A general rule in the Taxes Acts prevents there being any penalty for late filing if the delay is caused through a reasonable excuse. If the inspector accepts that the excuse is reasonable, he will set the penalty aside. If he does not agree, the employer can appeal to the independent commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of fixed penalties versus variable ones was controversial when it was first introduced for VAT. But it has become more accepted and was recommended by the Keith report. Although it may be complicated to do end of year returns in PAYE, it is not comparable with doing a personal tax return. There will be automatic penalties under the new pay and file system. To apply this to PAYE and the timing of PAYE returns is not unreasonable. Moreover, there is the let-out of reasonable excuse. I could go into the details of the timing and the latitude allowed, but my hon. Friend is probably well aware of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall speak with even greater brevity. This is another probing amendment, designed to make clear expressly that the burden of proving that any penalty has been incurred is on the Revenue. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and I tabled the amendment in the belief that it would be beneficial to have an on-the-record explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to give my hon. Friend a firm assurance on the record that the effect of the provision, as drafted, is that the onus of proof lies with the Revenue and that therefore the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Onus of proof is a difficult subject. I am advised that it rests on a mixture of general law and statutory provision. My hon. Friend is worried that by treating a determination of a penalty under the new proceedings as if it were an assessment, the onus of proof would shift from the Revenue to the taxpayer. That is not so. In an appeal against an assessment, the onus of proof can lie with the Revenue or with the taxpayer depending on the nature of the appeal and can also shift during the appeal hearing. Where an appeal is made against the quantum of an assessment the onus lies on the taxpayer, but where an appeal is made against the making of an assessment the onus lies with the inspector to show that there is a source to assess. That rule, which follows from principles of general law, puts the onus on the inspector in the penalty proceedings. It is therefore unnecessary to make that explicit in the statute for penalty proceedings as this amendment seeks to do. It is also unwise as the introduction of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
statutory rule for penalties could throw doubts on the rules for other similar proceedings including ordinary appeal hearings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am advised that the amendment might not have quite the effect intended because it relies for its operation on the difference between "shall" and "may"—a crucial distinction in many parts of the tax laws. That could be unwise. A series of tax cases, one of which may be familiar to my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) from his dealings with the Unquoted Companies Group, have shown that the meanings of "may" and "shall" can be rather unexpected. I can give my hon.

same as under the present procedures, apart from one exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time limit for the award of a penalty for assisting a taxpayer to make a false return or accounts for tax is, at present, six years from when the penalty was incurred. But the offence may not be discovered until after that, and Keith recommended that the time limit should be the same as for the recovery of tax from a taxpayer tho makes a false return, that is 20 years. There has been general support for this recommendation in the consultations since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question that might interest some of my hon. Friends, even if they have not been giving the matter close attention, is why should a penalty be charged on a person who has died? I was extremely interested in that myself. The rules for assessing and recovering tax and penalties from the personal representatives of deceased taxpayers were looked at by the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income in 1955. The Committee may be interested to hear this part of my brief. The Commission concluded that the rules at that time unduly favoured dead taxpayers, who had been the subject of investigation that demonstrate an offence, as against live taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
