	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are probably all quite uncomfortable in this heat, so it is perhaps in order for me to remind hon. Members that the length of their speeches will determine the time at which we get away. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will determine only the time that we get away from this Room as opposed to another. I accept your implied stricture, Mr. Crowther, and I shall not seek to protract my remarks. I apologise to the Committee if it felt that I went on at too great a length earlier—it is possible sometimes to have too much of a good thing. This is a serious topic and as it is unlikely to be debated on the Floor of the House, I thought it important to put those serious points on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the speech of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, as he seemed to be misleading himself. He said that sometimes we think that retrospection is a good thing and that when it is employed to someone's benefit, it should be treated on the same basis as retrospection when the result would adversely affect an individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When someone bestows his own money on somebody else, that is quite different in principle and in kind from forcing him to hand over the money to the Government. No symmetry is involved in that comparison because, if the Government choose to offer tax relief, they are perfectly entitled to do so. The other way round the problem is much more difficult. I have some difficulty with the notion that because it was the general view that the law was as the Revenue thought it was, that is what we should ensure is the law not only for the future, but for the period before the court decided otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many cases in English law, and, indeed, in tax law, in which different consequences could flow from similar circumstances. There was a great case in the late 1970s between Vestey and the Inland Revenue commissioners, which arose out of the provisions of section 478 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act. I shall not go into the details of that case, but it was accepted—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend cannot hear, so I shall speak louder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case arose out of facts that almost everyone had accepted as being the law for 30 or 40 years, but one taxpayer challenged the general view and was successful in getting the House of Lords to overturn a previous decision of the other place. When that section was introduced in the Finance Act 1935 or 1936—I forget which—the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day said that it would not be applied in the way in which the Revenue thereafter sought to apply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general view of a particular provision should not concern us too much. What matters is what the courts say. If the courts determine that the general view is wrong, it is not correct for the Government to reverse that decision retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see this case as being narrower than Padmore. In the Padmore case, all those who had embarked on litigation were given the benefit of the court's decision. In this case, only litigants who obtained the decision of the High Court received the benefit of the court's decision. In the Padmore case, it cannot conceivably be argued that Mr. Padmore's behaviour or that of the partnership would have been different or was influenced by the tax consequences of the circumstances that formed the basis of that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is suggesting that it is right to remove retrospectively the tax advantage that the Union Texas case had given to individual taxpayers, because their behaviour at the time was not influenced by the potential consequences that we now know to have been correct. However, the Padmore case was similar inasmuch as the behaviour of the individuals involved was not influenced by the tax consequences of the court's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fairly dangerous procedure to follow, by which we must look into the minds of individual taxpayers, who are successful perhaps because of the results of other people's litigation, to determine whether the Government are right to introduce retrospective tax legislation. We are taking a dangerous risk if we include such a clause in the Bill. The more often that we legislate in such a way, the easier it will become for future Governments to do the same. It is a bad example to set, and I hope that the Government will reconsider the provision before the Bill completes its passage through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to force the amendment to a Division, I know that I should not win. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) for his support. I should have certainly voted for him to be leader of his party. I regret, from his point of view, that the present leader of the Social and Liberal Democrats won the leadership election, although I do not regret the effect of that result on the party. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has shown by his support that he is the true voice of Liberalism. Notwithstanding that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) set out clearly the principles on which he approaches the clause, which were shared by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). They argued that retrospective legislation in fiscal matters is not appropriate. We cannot accept that. The Government are right to opt for retrospective legislation. They set a clear date when they announced their intention to introduce such changes. They are seeking to restore the position. In the circumstances, this is one of the exceptional cases when retrospection is valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall qualify what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said is my position. Retrospective legislation is always dangerous. In any circumstances in which it is contemplated, powerful arguments must be adduced for it. When such legislation is not only retrospective, but discriminates against individual citizens, it is worse than dangerous; it is outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to a point of which we perhaps lost sight at the conclusion of our previous debate. The Minister has effectively advised taxpayers always to challenge the Revenue's decisions and to ensure that their challenges are on record. He drew that distinction between the Padmore case and the Union Texas case. The hon. Gentleman asserted that, in Padmore, several taxpayers had notified their objections in various ways, and that that justified a slightly different treatment of their position as potential litigants. It is highly undesirable that, if there is the remotest scintilla of doubt about the interpretation of the law, taxpayers must enter, in a clear and identifiable way, their objection and wish to organise their tax affairs on the basis of a different interpretation of the law. That is necessary if they are to have any hope of benefiting from a more limited form of retrospective legislation in future. I cannot see the sense of the Revenue advising Ministers to advise taxpayers in that way, but it has done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the final point because the hon. Gentleman misinterpreted what I said. In the Padmore case, people had not simply notified the Revenue of their intention to appeal in a similar way, but the inspector had specifically agreed that they would be treated in the same way as Mr. Padmore and his 112 partners. More than a year after the court hearing of the Union Texas case, several people showed interest in the legal principles involved and said that they intended to appeal in a similar way. The inspectors refused explicitly to guarantee them similar treatment. The message that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) tries to convey is quite different from the one that logically follows the two cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said that retrospection is always wrong. I should find it perfectly normal if my hon. Friend were a die-hard reactionary and a man
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
of principle on this matter, but he emerges as a man of only half a principle. He says that retrospection is acceptable if it benefits taxpayers, but not if it harms taxpayers. He is, therefore, not prepared to follow his principle to its logical conclusion in the way that one would expect of him. I am sorry that he may be infected because of his friendship with the Liberal Benches, and becoming a man of compromise and wishy-washy Liberalism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is all the difference in the world between retrospection that is to the benefit of the taxpayer and retrospection that is adverse to his interests. I am sorry if, in my desire to compress my speech, I made it sound as if there was some confusion. One cannot equate conduct that is in somebody's interest with conduct that is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contest my hon. Friend the Minister's view that the Revenue had given clear information to those who had given notice of appeal against the determination by the inspector of foreign dividends, that the Union Texas case result would not be followed in their cases. It would have been incomprehensible to any taxpayer that the consequences of the Union Texas case could not be followed by an inspector of taxes, because a High Court decision would bind special commissioners and the Inland Revenue. Taxpayers were told that, pending the outcome of the Union Texas case, their appeals would be held over. It is shabby treatment to take away tax advantages from taxpayers when they do not prosecute their appeals further after an assurance from the Inland Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 116 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 117</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INTEREST PAYMENTS TO NETHERLANDS ANTILLES SUBSIDIARIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 402, in page 89, line 12, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in circumstances where if any part of the payment received is not so applied it is distributed to a United Kingdom resident company within a further 90 days".</p></blockquote>
Clause 117 is necessitated by the fact that the United Kingdom has suspended the operation of the double taxation convention with the Netherlands Antilles which, among other things, enabled interest to be paid by United Kingdom residents to the Netherlands Antilles without withholding tax at the basic rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the introduction in 1984 of domestic UK legislation that enabled Eurobonds to be issued directly by UK companies without having to withhold tax from interest, a favoured route to avoid the withholding obligation was for a UK company to issue such Eurobonds via a Netherlands Antilles company. The system would operate as follows. The Netherlands Antilles company would issue bonds to the world at large and would not have to withhold
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
income tax. The funds arising from such issue would be lent back the United Kingdom and interest would be paid on that from the United Kingdom to enable the interest to the third party holders to be paid. Under the double taxation convention, it was possible for interest to be paid between the UK and the Netherlands Antilles gross of tax and, therefore, on paid gross to the world at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 117 is to preserve that ability to pay gross even though the double taxation convention has been suspended. The Opposition find it somewhat incredible that the Government appear, by means of the clause, to be perpetuating the operation of what is in effect a tax haven. The Government will doubtless be able to explain to us the thinking behind the clause, but our first amendment seeks to ensure that the moneys that are paid from the United Kingdom without withholding tax to the Netherlands Antilles are either wholly applied to deal with the third party interest or, to the extent that they are not, are immediately repatriated to the UK by way of a taxable dividend. That would prevent the benefit of the extended relief enabling resources to be accumulated in the Netherlands Antilles company. It is a small amendment, but it would marginally improve the clause, which appears to continue and extend the tax relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) makes clear, the clause preserves the exemption from tax of interest paid from the United Kingdom to Netherlands Antilles finance subsidiaries to fund the payment of interest on Eurobonds issued by the latter before 26 July 1984. That follows a Government commitment to provide such exemption following termination—not suspension, as the hon. Gentleman said—of the double taxation agreement with the Netherlands Antilles last April. The clause as drafted guards against the exemption being abused. For example, Netherlands Antilles finance subsidiaries are required to use the interest to pay the Eurobond interest within 90 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add a further condition—that is, that if the interest is not so used, it must be paid back to the UK within a further 90 days. The Government do not think that it is reasonable to build in that further condition. If the main conditions of the clause are not met, the paying company will in any event have to account for income tax at the basic rate of 25 per cent. on payment of the interest. We go no further than that with payments of interest to any country with which we do not have a double taxation agreement. The amendment would be more onerous than most cases where there is no agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. The hon. Gentleman questioned the underlying rationale of continuing those arrangements with the Netherlands Antilles. The reason is that a number, albeit not great, of those bonds were issued when the agreement was in force. It is reasonable to continue the arrangements, on the expectation of which the bonds were issued. When the United States terminated its agreement, it caused considerable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
disruption in the market for the far larger number of bonds issued by similar arrangements under the United States Netherlands Antilles double taxation agreement. We did not wish to cause similar disruption in the market, even on a smaller scale, so we gave the assurance that that sort of protection would continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 116, I was prepared to contemplate a form of retrospection because we were not overthrowing the settled assumptions and expectations of business people. Here we wish to continue the arrangements because there is a reasonable expectation that they will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the analogy that the Economic Secretary is attempting to draw somewhat specious. The similarity between retrospective clarification or amendment of taxation law and a decision to continue arrangements rather than end a double taxation treaty with another state seems to push the analogy too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary said that there are attempts in the clause to place restrictions on the way in which relief can be claimed. I accept that, although we feel that the Government should have gone further and we shall move a further amendment to that effect. However, in the light of the Economic Secretary's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 400, in page 89, line 18, leave out "90 per cent." and insert "wholly-owned".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall also consider amendment No. 401, in page 89, line 21, leave out "90 per cent." and insert "wholly-owned".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would tighten up further the restrictions in the clause on the relief available via the Netherlands Antilles route. The amendment would require the extra relief to be available only where the Netherlands Antilles subsidiary was a wholly owned subsidiary of a United Kingdom company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as it stands allows a partial portion of the company not to be United Kingdom owned—only 90 per cent. must be United Kingdom owned. We are unsure why the Government are allowing a 10 per cent. gap and are attempting to make the restriction tighter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that, in terms of the Taxes Act 1988, a 90 per cent. rule is tantamount to a wholly owned requirement. As far as I know, it is the highest amount ever specified to achieve that result. Having a 100 per cent. test would create various technical difficulties, because under United Kingdom law a company must have a minimum of two shareholders. So 100 per cent. ownership is not normally achieved by one shareholder. Ninety per cent. is the requirement normally used at the highest level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This must be a rare example of 90 per cent. equalling 100 per cent. I accept what the Economic Secretary has said. I understand the technical reason, and it is with alacrity that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 403, in page 89, line 34, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) This section shall have effect only until a review of the obligation of the United Kingdom to participate in proposals for a withholding tax as proposed by the European Community have been completed.".</p></blockquote>
This is a cheeky amendment, which has been tabled in a probing spirit. The Economic Secretary will recall the debate a few weeks ago on the Floor of the House about European Community documents on proposals for a common withholding tax throughout the European Community. The Economic Secretary gave the Government's forthright view that those proposals were unacceptable, but the Opposition gave a warmer welcome to the idea, although we had considerable objections to the precise details that were floated by the European Commission. The amendment seeks to flush out from the Government an idea of the timetable, to get their prognosis of the discussions and considerations in the Community about the withholding tax proposals and to discover whether they think that progress will be made in that direction in the foreseeable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to learn that this is a flushing amendment, following previous probing amendments. As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary points out, the Opposition clearly have a great future if they ever join up with Dyno-rod. I accept the spirit in which the amendment is moved and that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) is harking back to the debates that we had on withholding tax. He said that the Opposition were warmer toward it than I was. I am happy to say that after I sounded the trumpet against a withholding tax, the walls of Jericho duly fell and the whole proposal is dead, if not buried. It would not provide much support for the amendment that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury puts forward in his flushing approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's proposals did not include interest payments to residents who are not members of the Community. I confess that I do not fully understand what the hon. Gentleman wants to flush out from me, other than the fate of the European Commission's proposals and their potential relevance to the clause. However, I hope that I have satisfied him on at least half his request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has achieved 100 per cent., or should I say 90 per cent., of its purpose by extracting from the Economic Secretary the fact that the withholding tax proposals are now consigned to effective oblivion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, we still find it peculiar that the Government are intent on maintaining the arrangements for the Netherlands Antilles following the end of the double taxation treaty. The Government are inserting some criteria that must be met if the tax relief is to be obtained, but, as far as we can see, it will still be possible to engineer relief via the Netherlands Antilles route in a way that would normally not be possible. Why are the Government intent on not closing that avenue for relief? I can understand their anxiety not to rock the market too much, but the interests of the Exchequer as a whole must be borne in mind and the Government seem to be forgetting those interests in their perpetuation of the arrangements that they are enshrining in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a specific question about Aruba, which is referred to in subsection (3) of clause 117. Aruba used to be part of the Netherlands Antilles and became independent some two or three years ago. It was, therefore, covered by the original double taxation treaty. Those arrangements were perpetuated after independence, but it would appear that a special arrangement now needs to be made. The provisions of subsection (3)(a)(i) appear to be somewhat different from those of subsection (3)(a)(ii) and it would be interesting to know why Aruba seems to be dealt with differently in each. I hope that the Government will give us some information on that as well as a justification—if that is what it can be called—for what appears to be a route for tax avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make it clear that we have terminated our agreement. There is no loophole left for anyone to set up new bonds that are based on the old privilege. All that we have done is to protect existing holders of bonds issued prior to 1984, and that is only right and proper. I am surprised that the Opposition should suggest that we should in any way penalise holders of those bonds by depriving them of the ultimate source of the interest payable on them. I am sure that that is not the ultimate intention of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and that he merely imagined that we would enable new bonds of a similar nature to be created. That is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Aruba, I understand that whereas it was part of the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands Antilles were deemed to be a country within the Netherlands, Aruba is now a separate country within the Netherlands. That strikes me as slightly strange terminology, but apparently it is what is required. I believe—although I cannot read the writing currently in front of me—that the current situation of Aruba does not matter. We are protecting bonds issued prior to 1984, not creating an opportunity for Aruba to issue new ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will astound you, Mr. Crowther, but there are those among our parliamentary colleagues in both parties who consider that at times—not always—the proceedings of this Committee are dull. I cannot see how anybody could possibly hold such a view, and to demonstrate our versatility of subject matter we move from Aruba and the interests of large multinational oil companies and their demands for a £17 million hike from the British taxpayer to discuss sports stadiums—[Hon. Members: "Stadia."] I am corrected by the classical scholars on the Government Back Benches. The correct term is "stadia", but it is not a word that trips off my tongue easily. However, I shall conform to the request of Conservative Back-Bench Members in an attempt to curry favour with them and say, "stadia".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If it is of any help to the hon. Member I remind him that the clause refers to "sports grounds" rather than to "stadiums" or "stadia".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At your behest, Mr. Crowther, I happily withdraw my reference to "stadia" and shall refer to "sports grounds". However, they may well be grounds on which stadia or stadiums are built and which may even require improving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know about you, Mr. Crowther, but I am beginning to fear for the future of the Government's Treasury team. You have a loftier and more independent view from your spot up there on the platform—a very impressive spot it is too. You will have seen, as I have, the speculation in the weekend press that the Government's Front-Bench representatives are all destined for higher, or at least for different, things. That speculation may have unsettled them somewhat. So far tonight the Financial Secretary has led his own Back Benchers to vote down two clauses that the Chancellor placed in the Bill on Second Reading, and they went on to filibuster their own legislation for two hours in a dispute that the Financial Secretary clearly thought was settled. Still, that is the modern Conservative party. It looks as if the rows between the Chancellor and the Prime Minister are not the only disagreements taking place on Conservative Benches, but I do not want to exacerbate their difficulties too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
Instead, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to amendments Nos. 404 and 405, which address themselves to matters of direct concern to our constituents and those of just about every hon. Member. Clause 120 extends the provisions of previous enactments enabling capital allowances to be claimed on expenditure at sports grounds, for certified requirements under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 provides that safety certification would extend in other circumstances to regulated stands, which are generally stands that provide covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators. The purpose of amendment No. 404 is to ensure that, whether or not the ground is encompassed in a certification procedure, the capital allowance would be extended to take account of the provision of additional or enhanced seating arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our view that much of that type of expenditure would qualify under the basic rules, but it might not necessarily follow for some of the conversion works that might be deemed necessary, and it is our view that it should. In other words, we are proposing that, just for once, instead of tightening up the concession, we should extend it. It does not require any great knowledge of public life and recent events to see why we are arguing that. It is the view of the parliamentary Labour party that our sports grounds, which provide so much pleasure for so many people, should be made as safe as possible. In the light of recent events, that should be a general view. The tax system should facilitate that where it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 405 similarly seeks to extend the provisions in certain circumstances. The 1975 and 1987 Acts on safety would not necessarily cover what had to be done at sports grounds that fell outside the scope of the 1975 Act, or expenditure that did not apply to regulated stands under the 1987 Act. The purpose of the amendment is to cover, if not otherwise covered, the general costs for converting non-seating areas into seating accommodation. The conversion of such areas may become a requirement, or at least a strong recommendation. It is wrong that tax concessions should not be available—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that amendments Nos. 404 and 405 relate directly to the tragic events at Hillsborough, where we saw the unfortunate consequence of stands without seats? Does my hon. Friend further agree that, in the terrible internal dispute in the Conservative party about whether legislation should be held up to take account of the Hillsborough inquiry, in the end the Prime Minister was forced to compromise with the views of other Conservative Members? On the current dispute over whether we should join the European monetary system, will my hon. Friend hazard a view on whether there will be a similar compromise? Possibly hope springs eternal on the Treasury Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a very helpful intervention, for which I thank my hon. Friend. She is right to refer to recent tragic events that have motivated the

amendments. That should encourage support from both sides of the Committee, whether or not hon. Members are paid to support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties that have arisen through the Government's review of their approach to sports in general and to football in particular have shown the Conservative party to be divided, just as it is over the EMS. However, I may incur your slight displeasure, Mr. Crowther, if I explore that further as we are not discussing the EMS. The Government must introduce specific proposals to ensure that sports grounds are safe. Turmoil in Government ranks does not encourage anyone to be confident that a sensible solution to the range of issues will be reached, but God forbid that disunity and over-assertiveness at the top should lead to a failure to take proper action and to avoid another tragedy. That might be the result of delays, confusion and the half-baked notions that pass for Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's view is clear. Tax concessions should be in place so that the necessary work can be carried out and so that clubs and the owners of grounds—sometimes local authorities—are encouraged to put the work in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) said, this is an extremely serious issue. I do not complain about it being raised, but the amendments are unnecessary and will not have the effect that the Opposition think. The Government set up the Taylor inquiry into the tragic events at Hillsborough and will examine the findings, including those given in any interim report, but the aim of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is not well targeted and to some extent it is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of amendments Nos. 404 and 405 is basically the same. Amendment No. 404 seeks to give precise relief to regulated stands at smaller sports grounds that will be subject to a certification procedure. It would widen the relief provided by the clause to cover costs incurred by a trader in providing extra, improved seating arrangements in a regulated stand at a sports ground. Although this may not have been the intention, the effect of the amendment would be that relief would be available not only for the installation of new or better seating but for the cost of putting up an entirely new stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Costs of erecting the basic fabric of commercial buildings do not normally attract capital allowances. As football clubs are commercial undertakings for tax purposes, construction costs of buildings at football grounds normally fall within that general exclusion. However, part of the cost of ground improvements, including new stands, represents the cost of installing items of machinery or plant. To the extent that machinery or equipment is being installed that would normally qualify for the 25 per cent. writing-down allowance, that will happen. But that is not true of the general investment that is likely to be made. Football grounds are out of line with industrial buildings and are more akin to commercial buildings.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East had in mind the cost of installing seating, which is in everyone's mind. That cost may qualify for relief if the seats are not part of the basic structure. The cost qualifies if the seats are bolted to the stand or are otherwise moveable. The incidental costs of adapting an existing structure to take such seats also qualifies. Experience has shown that the major part of the cost of converting existing standing accommodation to take seats is usually relieved in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed the point of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown). My hon. Friend did not ask whether tax exemption is available for seating. He tried to say that under the Bill tax exemption is available for seating only if it is installed in response to the demands of a safety certificate or because a local authority has required that. If a football club, such as Arsenal in my constituency, of its own volition and with forethought and care for its fans, decides to instal seating, tax exmption is not available. Football clubs that show forethought are being penalised by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely reasonable and right that tax allowances should be available for what football clubs are obliged by local authorities to do. During an earlier debate we discussed benefits in kind security provisions. Opposition Members expressed anxiety about whether the provision would be abused. It cannot be left to football clubs to decide what needs to be done in the interests of safety. There is a certification procedure concerning safety and it is right that tax allowances should be given in accordance with what the Inland Revenue judges to be necessary for safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had introduced a wider provision, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East would have asked questions about directors' boxes and whether they qualify on the grounds of safety. There would have been questions about all sorts of elitist facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made a good point when she said that the requirements under the certification procedure may alter in the light of experience. The Taylor committee is sitting at the moment and we shall examine its recommendations. If they have an implication on the certification procedure, we shall decide whether there will be an impact on the available tax relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he is waiting for the recommendations of the Taylor committee, but he is not waiting for the final outcome of the identity card scheme and the capital expenditure to which that will give rise.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Crowther.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing safety and certification for safety purposes and the amendment refers to seating. Whether turnstiles will qualify for capital allowances is entirely unrelated to safety issues. We are debating whether installing new seating will qualify for capital allowances. It is possible that it could. What is required through the certification procedure may alter and the Government will consider the Taylor report, which may or may not raise questions of tax allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the amendment would take the special relief for safety expenditure far too wide. Had we done that, we should have been exposed to much criticism about directors' entertaining and all sorts of things that go on at Aston Villa or other clubs and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East would have criticised me. There would be no specific link to safety requirements and relief at the enhanced machinery or plant rate would be available for construction costs of the actual fabric of what would be a commercial structure. That would obviously have repercussions for the costs of other commercial buildings which do not attract capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 404 raises the same issues as amendment No. 405, but the first is restricted to smaller stadia. The arguments are the same for both amendments but I cannot recommend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) would clarify the matter for me, but it has not. Perhaps I am the only member of the Committee who does not understand. I read the clause as referring to the extension of relief to undesignated sports grounds. In Scotland, "undesignated" means small sports grounds that do not have a capacity of more than 10,000, if I remember rightly. If the capacity is more than 10,000, the local council must ensure that particular safety measures are introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all been understandbly obsessed with the Hillsborough disaster. As soon as we hear anything about sports grounds, we immediately slip into our Hillsborough mode, but the clause must have been drafted pre-Hillsborough and inserted for reasons other than those connected with that tragedy. I hope that the Minister will explain the Government's thinking before that disaster as they could not have been considering the matter in a Hillsborough frame of mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because of Hillsborough that we have automatically put the matter into a football context, but the clause covers sports grounds generally. What
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
were the Government's thoughts at that time? I do not know what a "regulated stand" in an undesignated or uncertificated sports ground is. I am not familiar with that concept. I thought that there were sports grounds which were certificated or designated that had been given certificates of approval, which included their stands. The concept of a "regulated stand" in an unregulated sports ground is new to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is because of our Scottish background, as against an English or Welsh background, but neither my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) nor I recognise those terms. Will the Minister clarify them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up some of the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington). Mention has been made of the tragic consequences of the lack of adequate seating. Some of us who use small grounds welcome the rusty nature of such antiquated stadia. When I played rugby football, I was especially fond of an old iron pipe that ran along the front of the stand of the rugby team for which I played, and which held up the seating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The iron pipe was especially useful when obnoxiously fast backs were running at me; I could tap them so that they collided with the rusty pipe. It served several functions, such as preventing the opposition from scoring tries. It boosted the intake rate of the out-patients department of the local hospital, and it enabled the Neath Valley health authority to boast that it dispensed more tetanus serum on Saturdays than almost any other authority in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that that took place during the games he played in Wales, and not when he once played for the rugby club in Esher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but it was uncalled for. My playing for Esher was a temporary aberration—one Saturday, I was short of a few bob. Having sons of my own, I hope that they do not play rugby as they could end up impaled on the same iron pipe on which their father used to impale other players.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All lightness, aside, we must consider seriously the conditions of grounds. Many clubs, like the one for which I played, have grounds that could be refurbished. Those clubs are the centre of their communities. We must encourage them to do their utmost to replace inadequate and dangerous seating arrangements and to replace muddy stretches of grass and rusty iron pipes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate, nor do I wish to rouse too much excitement in the Committee at this late hour. I wish however, to remind the Committee of the parable of the foolish and wise virgins. I am sure that hon. Members, like me, have an A-level in religious education. None the less, I remind them that the wise virgins had thought for the morrow and carried oil to fill their lamps. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
foolish virgins had no thought for the morrow, did not have enough oil and their lamps went out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the amendments, it seems that football clubs that might be characterised as wise virgins with thought for the morrow and which install proper seating would not be liable for tax exemption. However, under the tax regime in the Bill, foolish virgins will be liable for tax exemption. Can that be fair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must not chatter among themselves from sedentary positions while we are hearing about all those virgins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is even more complicated than that which the hon. Lady so vividly portrayed. The Minister said that the relief extended to the requirements imposed by local authorities. However, we know from recent experience that there is a substantial variation in practice among local authorities on what they regard as essential safety modifications in stands at sports grounds. To some extent, one might welcome some variation, so that it takes account of local circumstances. It can be irritating to be concerned with a small sports ground far from other parts of the country where there are problems and to have an inflexible national regime imposed. A club in one area may, because of the foresight described by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) make improvements to a stand, only to find that a club in another area is required to make similar improvements by the local authority and will, therefore, obtain tax relief for so doing. It is obviously right in principle that any club which is required to make changes should be able to get relief for them. However, it would seem illogical if other clubs were not forced by their local authority to make the change but did so nevetheless without receiving the tax relief, especially if a year later the local authority decides that it, too, will enforce that principle. By that time the club will have installed the facilities that have been the subject of the relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities have only one or two designated sports grounds in their area. It may be different in south Wales where there is a proliferation of rugby clubs with not only stands but seating accommodation. I think that the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) was exaggerating slightly when he described the facilities at some of the grounds. In the whole of the Northumberland county council area, which is extremely large, there are not more than two or three designated sports grounds: the Berwick Rangers football club and the Berwick speedway club being foremost among them. The local authority in such an area has only limited experience to build on. The situation is likely to arise where the authority rules that something is not necessary but the clubs nevetheless install it. A year later the authority decides to change its rules, by which time all the clubs in the area have spent the money and none has been eligible for the tax relief. That anomaly is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
something that the Minister could perhaps consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I got the impression from the Minister's speech that amendments Nos. 404 and 405 could drive a coach and horses through the tax system and would result in massive misappropriation of money for purposes which were not really that desirable. It seems to me that the amendments would have desirable results. They demonstrate the foresight that some clubs will have in wanting to make their clubs safer before being required to do so by statute. If the Minister were concerned about the possibility of abuse, it would be fairly easy to draw up ground rules on the type of expenditure that would qualify under the general headings. I hope that in spite of what he said earlier the Minister will be prepared to admit the principle of the amendments and perhaps present them in a fashion which the Government feel would achieve the objectives which have been set down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the basic point. Clause 120 extends capital allowances for safety expenditure at designated sports grounds. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said that he did not quite understand the technicalities but he summarised them correctly. Capital allowances for equipment for safety purposes are being extended to the smaller sports grounds. As I have explained, one of the main issues that arises is that of converting terraces to seating, and in most circumstances that will also qualify for capital allowances. However, to go wider than that and to say that there ought to be capital allowances on a scale that does not apply to industrial or commercial buildings is to go too wide when there are capital allowances specifically for safety equipment. That can cover converting terraces to seating, which is thought to be extremely important. That seems an eminently reasonable position. I regard that conversion as seriously as Opposition Members do. The Taylor committe is examining the issue and if it makes specific recommendations that have implications for the tax system, we shall consider them. I am not convinced that the tax system is not well focused and targeted upon investment and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) said about looking ahead and incentive is pointed and right, but the football clubs themselves have a responsibility. We cannot sit back and argue that we should give generous tax reliefs to football clubs only that would be way beyond those that would be available to other commercial, or non-commercial organisations. It is not only a matter of tax allowances and taxpayers making available money through tax subsidy. We have a system that enables a large part of what is required for specifically safety purposes to be allowed against tax. I want to emphasise the responsibility of the football clubs as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary, according to the facts as they stand. If the Taylor committee report raises other issues, we shall examine them. These are very serious matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be my ignorance, but what is a regulated stand? I understand the concept of a certificated or designated ground and many grounds of professional football clubs, even in the Scottish second division, are not certificated, regulated grounds because they do not have the relevant capacity. I am not familiar with the concept of a regulated stand in an uncertificated ground. Is that every stand in a sports arena? What is the difference between a regulated stand and an unregulated one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Individual stands in undesignated areas now require a safety certificate. We are extending that to the smaller grounds. The 1987 Act reflects the recommendations of the Popplewell report by requiring a further extension of the safety certificate requirements to regulated stands, which are stands at undesignated sports grounds that provide covered accommodation for 500 or more spectators. That extension came into effect in 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) asked about numbers. The Home Office estimates that there are about 400 sports grounds with at least one stand liable to be certificated. Expenditure on safety work is likely to range from a few hundred pounds up to, say, £25,000 at grounds that attract larger crowds. Only expenditure at grounds that are run on a commercial basis, so as to be chargeable to tax, will attract relief. Many of those grounds are not operated on such a basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall examine this issue in the light of the Taylor report. To extend 25 per cent. capital allowances, which is what one receives for investment in plant and machinery in manufacturing industry, goes far too wide. The existing system gives generous capital allowances for specific investment in what is required for safety and in the conversion of terraces to seating in the larger grounds, and now in some smaller ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I saw him talking to the Government Whip a few moments ago. Perhaps he has been sent away as a conciliatory gesture to the Committee. He was happy to take up our time to discuss matters that were important to him, so I hope that the Government will not be churlish if we now discuss matters that are important to us, such as the safety of our constituents who visit sports grounds. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) was right to remind us that we are discussing a range of sportsgrounds and not only football grounds in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, and that the Government tabled the clause before the Hillsborough disaster. The Financial Secretary argued that our proposals are unnecessary, that they will not achieve their objective and that the Labour party is unusually suggesting measures that widen rather than restrict tax concessions. He argued
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
that had the Conservative party put forward our proposals, we would have complained about directors' boxes. My football team, Newcastle United, is in such a state that the provision of reinforced boxes for the directors probably could be justified on safety grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am practising for my own time as Minister, so I shall say that I shall check on those matters and write to my hon. Friend. However, we do not yet need the provision of personal bodyguards and the other things that are covered by the security clauses. Safe boxes will probably be sufficient at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) answered the Financial Secretary's point about the clauses not achieving objectives by saying that the Labour party did not intend to drive a coach and horses through the tax system, and our amendments do nothing of the sort. They have limited application. They apply to sports grounds and have no wider impact on the tax system or property development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In kindness and charity I shall pass over the cruel and sinisterly-meant intervention from the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor). I am certain that my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) was properly motivated in all his sporting activities. His amateur status has not been impinged upon except under the direst of necessities. Playing for Esher probably qualifies as that!

My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott) was right to remind the Committee of the parable of the wise and the foolish virgins. I know that the point about foolish virgins will have been well taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman briefly tell the Committee whether he thinks the wise virgins did, or did not, receive tax relief on their investment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This topic would normally be covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). If the hon. Gentleman is inviting me to invite my hon. Friend to come here and address us on these topics, and perhaps a new clause, I am sure that it could be arranged. However, I do not think that things have deteriorated quite that far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the spirit in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington spoke, and the point about the parable was well made. When she referred to foolish virgins, the SLD spokesman, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), rose, on cue, to make some extremely good points about the clause and to talk to us about the excellence of Berwick's famous speedway team and its football team which—if things continue as they are, will probably be even more famous than mine.

The Financial Secretary had no real response to the debate except to repeat his three main points: the

Government wanted to wait on Taylor; the amendments were unnecessary and would not achieve their objectives; and the amendments could open the field for abuse. I do not understand how there could be scope for abuse. Both amendments have a limited application, and it is difficult to see how one could possibly improve a sports ground beyond the improvements that need making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman think that it would be justifiable to give a 25 per cent. writing-down allowance—it is specifically restricted to capital investment and capital equipment—to a sports stadium alone, and to all items in a sports stadium, regardless of safety, when that is not allowed for commercial and industrial buildings? Does he believe that what he is proposing would be a consistent rule in the tax system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not saying that; I am saying that one should explore the possibility—indeed, the necessity—of making exceptions for sports stadiums for two good reasons. The first is the precarious nature of their financing and the second is the enormous numbers of people who congregate within them temporarily and the safety factors that follow in the wake of that. It is our contention that sports grounds do not follow the sorts of rule that might apply more generally. That is why our amendments are restricted to sports grounds and do not run wider into the taxation system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Illsley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend consider a matter that has not been raised in debate and follows on from the point made by the Financial Secretary? Both the amendments relate to seating arrangements, and the points that have been made in this Committee relate to the Hillsborough disaster. The Financial Secretary refers to capital allowances, but much depends on how one considers the introduction of seating arrangements. Are they improvements, or are they safety arrangements within the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 120 appears to arise out of the Bradford city tragedy in which a stand burned down, hence the extension of the provisions under the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. Are not our amendments somewhat forward looking in implementing the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster by classifying the replacement of seating as a safety measure in the same way that the replacement of stands now is a safety measure following on from Bradford?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) made a very helpful intervention and the Financial Secretary has put his finger on the nub of the argument, as he always does. He said, "Almost certainly". The Labour party says that that is not good enough. We do not want "almost certainly". We want the amendments, which will mean "absolutely certainly". If the Financial Secretary has any disagreement with "absolutely certainly", he should think again about Bradford and Hillsborough and ask himself whether he really thinks that we should be waiting for the Taylor report or acting now.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be reasonable to advert to two points to which I referred earlier. First, although the clause could have been extended to include other requirements placed by the Government on sports grounds, it does not include any provision for the expenditure that may be required if the legislation on identity cards goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, subsection (1)(b) leads me to think about the exchange that will take place between sports grounds, club directors, club committees and local authorities. Let us take a "wise virgin" club, to use the words of the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms. Abbott), which is considering a reasonable improvement in safety provisions in the ground, such as seating, an increased number of entrances and exits to the ground and modifications to the catering facilities to ensure that there is not a sudden crush of people in some part of the stand. When the local authority first visits the ground, those matters will be discussed. If the maximum benefit of tax relief is to be obtained, the club proprietors will want a letter from the authority that states that the likelihood of its granting the club a certificate will be much greater if the club does certain things, including what the club wants and what the authority feels is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The club should seek the maximum explicit statement in the local authority's letter or document of all the improvements that the club is prepared to contemplate doing and which would add to the safety of the ground. If the local authority provides the minimum and simply specifies that the club must, for example, remove perimeter fencing or improve its physical structure so that it will not fall down, it will be doing the club a disservice. If the authority spells out in detail what the club has said that it is prepared to do, that will add substantially to the safety of the ground and ensure that the club obtains the benefit of tax relief in the proceess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I marvel at the ingenuity of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) in getting in a reference to the Government's identity card scheme, Mr. Crowther, despite your warnings. I assume that I am allowed to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. If there is plant or machinery that is related to the ID scheme, it will, if it is of a capital nature, qualify for the 25 per cent. writing-down allowance, regardless of the fact that it is unrelated to safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, the certification procedure is evolving. As I said repeatedly in our previous debate, the procedure may change in the light of the Taylor report and its findings. That will have a bearing on all the issues that we have discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Financial Secretary is bubbling over with enthusiasm to answer my question, but it is not appropriate at this hour to provoke a wholesale debate on the ideal rates of capital gains tax. That is a wide issue and many hon. Members would want to contribute to the debate. However, I should like to know the Government's justification for the present level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The justification for the amount exempt from capital gains tax is, and always has been, administrative. That has not always been understood, because it is not like the personal allowance. The argument has always been that to make the cost of collecting the tax economic and relieve the burden on the Revenue, we do not want the tax to catch large numbers of people with relatively small capital gains on which small tax liabilities arise. That is why the exempt amount was set at £5,000 when the provision was introduced. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion of indexing the level does not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be allowed to get away with that. My hon. Friends were interested in his idea that the level should be indexed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To avoid any doubt, may I make it clear to the Financial Secretary, whose misunderstanding is more mischievous than genuine, that I was not suggesting that the allowance should be index-linked? I was seeking to explore the Government's—not the Opposition's—reasons for not increasing the exempt amount. To increase it would be more in line with their philosophy than with ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East uses the phraseology of the Leader of the Opposition. He wants too much luxury if he thinks that he can question the fact that the allowance is as high as it is while asking why it is not indexed. Those questions are slightly inconsistent, but I am happy to answer both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained why the amount is not indexed. It is not too high because it is pitched at a level that reduces the administrative burden of having the tax applied to relatively small gains. That has always been the justification for the limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INCREASE OF CHATTEL EXEMPTION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 406, in page 92, line 15, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall operate for 1989–90 and subsequent years as though all assets comprising tangible moveable property disposed of in a year were treated as a single asset and consequential amendments were made to S.128 CGTA 1979".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall also take amendment No. 408, in page 92, line 95, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"except that where the increased chattel exemption is taken under S128 CGTA 1979 the individual's annual exempt amount under section 5 CGTA 1979 shall be reduced by the additional chargeable gains which would have arisen in the year but for the provisions of the said S.128."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are grouped together as they cover similar points. The clause extends relief for disposables of tangible, moveable property and, as drafted, means that if any item is not part of a set and is sold singly for £3,000 or less, it will fall entirely outside the capital gains tax net. Any number of separate items may be sold during the year unless they comprise a set—for example, six antique chairs. The items that would be covered include works of art, which are generally in the domain of those who can afford them. The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the relief and to treat all assets sold during a year as a single asset so that the £6,000 limit would be available for aggregate disposals only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some consequential adjustments would be required to the basic legislation to treat, for example, the assets first disposed of during the year to use up the amount of the consideration, but I am sure that that could be done. The present system is unfair because it benefits those who are better off and who are able to take advantage of selling a work of art.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
Most people and certainly most of my constituents do not trade in such articles and resent the tax relief that is available to those who do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 406 would ensure that when the chattels exemption is taken, the annual exemption would be reduced by the amount by which chargeable gains that have otherwise arisen are not brought into the net. It would reduce the annual exemption because of the existence of the chattels exemption. The motivation behind the amendment is the same as that behind amendment No. 408. The relief is too wide and should, at least in part, be clawed back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rationale for the chattels exemption is the same as for the exempt amount for capital gains. It is essentially administrative. The intention is to keep relatively small gains out of tax rather than incurring the disproportionate compliance costs for the Inland Revenue, which would exceed the benefits that are liable to be raised. The objections to the amendments are administrative. The chattels exemption must be considered in the context of the withdrawal of the gifts relief. It has not been raised since 1982 and we believe that it is time to increase it. The amendment would partly defeat the objective to make that change by ensuring that there is a corresponding reduction in the annual exempt amount for capital gains tax. The proposition has merely to be stated to show that a highly labour-intensive calculation would be required. If the benefit of the chattels exemption were to be denied, it would be easier simply to deny it, but to do that by reducing the capital gains exempt amount would be over complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendment would set the exemption limit for total proceeds from all chattels disposals during a year. Taxpayers would have to keep records of all disposals, however small, to see if they were taken over the limit. That would include disposals of tiny items that would contribute towards the total. The gain would not be worth the candle. If the hon. Gentleman is against increasing the chattels exemption, he must vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main argument advanced by the Financial Secretary is administrative convenience. But in the name of administrative convenience the allowance is being doubled. That is quite a concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the other points made by the Financial Secretary. There is a case for considering those matters in a simple and straightforward rather than a convoluted way. That argument strikes a chord and I have some sympathy with it. On that ground alone, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"except that it shall not affect the operation of any enactment in relation to such a disposal in a case where the enactment operates in consequence of relief having been given under section 79 of the Finance Act 1980 in respect of a disposal made before that date)".—[	<i>Mr. Norman Lamont.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is an important one which will reform the capital gains tax relief for gifts by individuals and trusts. When someone gives away an asset, he is deemed to have disposed of it at market value. Under existing law, gifts hold-over relief is available on the making of a claim. That allows any tax on a gain in the capital value of the asset to be deferred until the asset is disposed of by the donee. We propose to withdraw this general relief for gifts. When assets are given away on or after Budget day only certain gifts will qualify for relief. The present relief for gifts has not always been part of the capital gains tax system. It was introduced as recently as 1980. The justification for it then was that a person who gave an asset away during his lifetime faced a double charge both on capital transfer tax and capital gains tax. Since the abolition of capital transfer tax and the removal of the general tax charge on lifetime transfers the whole rationale for capital gains tax hold-over relief for gifts has disappeared. With no general lifetime charge for inheritance tax, gifts relief can enable assets to pass through the generations indefinitely without any tax charge. In substituting inheritance tax for capital transfer tax, we intended that there should be a tax charge on death but that assets would not be given away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also become clear that the relief is now used not simply to defer payment of tax, but to reduce the amount of the charge on the gain up to the date of the gift. That has become more and more a part of tax plannng.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain limited situations there is an immediate occasion of charge to inheritance tax when an asset is given away or disposed of, other than at arms length. In those circumstances the original justification for deferring any capital gains tax charge holds good and we propose to retain hold-over relief. The examples that we have in mind are when assets are transferred into or out of discretionary trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a brief and extremely inadequate discussion of the basic rationale. A number of amendments have been tabled which refer to the issue, so it would probably be best if we dealt with those matters as the amendments come up for discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) has tabled amendments to which I shall respond and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) also has some comments to make. It would be better to respond then to the matters that are raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is approaching our proceedings in the right way. I shall be brief and will confine my comments to the discussions that we shall have on schedule 14. The Financial Secretary is right that the clause is significant. Along with schedule 14, it deals with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
anti-avoidance matters. Previously it was possible to give assets to members of one's family and thus elect to defer the gain, effectively forever, as on death there would be an exemption. The purpose of the schedule is to reinstate the right to defer tax on a gift, but the opportunities for doing so are to be more restricted. The breadth of that restriction will be the subject of some discussions between the Financial Secretary and ourselves when we reach the amendments that deal with the points of contention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to accept that these matters should be discussed under the schedule. Partly because I have had instructions from several different sources, I have not yet encapsulated my remarks, and I hope to make them in the debate on the schedule. There has been a remarkable circular tour. First relief was given for gains tax; it was then given for inheritance tax; now we are reintroducing a charge for gifts. That reflects differences in attitude, though I shall not oppose the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption from gains tax in 1980 left capital transfer tax, as it then was—inheritance tax as it now is—at a level of £67,000 of transfer. Now gains tax will come in at a level of £5,000. That represents a rather deep dig.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point refers to the general complexity of the tax in comparison with its predecessor. I am gfiven to understand that section 79 of the Finance Act 1980, which was the relieving measure in relation to gains tax, occupied less than a page. The same cannot be said of schedule 14. It is regrettable that we have had to take this roundabout and long-winded approach to the issue, while possibly still not covering some of the main points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to employees. We argue that this would encourage vendors to pass on some benefit of their business to employees, to obtain the tax advantage for deferment of gifts of business assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the taxpayer is to make a concession, we believe that there should be some public interest argument for so doing. The amendments would encourage the broader spread of share ownership to which the Financial Secretary has said the Government are so committed. I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman will not find my arguments compelling, but I await his reply with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would form a sort of link between gifts relief and employee share ownership plans. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) argued that we should have gifts relief for business assets only if 25 per cent. of the value of the business is given away to the employees. It is important to make a relief for business assets from capital gains tax on gifts, for all the reasons that also apply to inheritance tax anyway. We do not wish to damage businesses, especially unquoted businesses. The hon. Gentleman may be anxious to bolt the amendment on to the Bill, but I am sure that he does not really believe in what it suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1978, the Labour Government introduced gifts relief for business assets, and there was no attempt then to confine it to instances when employees were being given a stake in the business. We are wholly in favour of employees being given a stake in business. We made that clear when we discussed the ESOPs amendments. The hon. Gentleman has clarified his argument up to a point, but I doubt whether he would pursue it in the real—or, rather, the unreal—world of a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will happen in the real world of a Labour Government remains to be seen in the near future.

	<br><blockquote><p>"and does not become so within three years following the disposal".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the purpose of paragraph 2 is to ensure that deferment of capital gains tax is not available in respect of qualifying business assets when the transfer is to someone who is not resident in the United Kingdom. That is to prevent someone who is non-resident ceasing to use his assets for business purposes within the UK and escaping a clawback of the deferred gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add to the requirement that the deferment should not apply when the transferee is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom the requirement that someone who might initially be resident or ordinarily resident must stay for the following three years. We are trying to ensure that the concessions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
cannot be manipulated by those who have no real or lasting commitment to our country or to its business affairs. The amendment would ensure that the concession applied to British business men and would not be exploited by those who flit in and out of our economic system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a modest amendment requiring that the shares of trading companies that can get the benefit of the provisions of the schedule have to be those where not less than 50 per cent. of voting rights are exercisable by the trustees. At present not less than 25 per cent. of voting rights must be so available. The change is modest and I should like to explore with the Financial Secretary the Government's thinking behind the 25 per cent. threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the proposals in the Bill, hold-over relief is preserved for gifts of business assets. The definition of business assets is widely drawn and includes all gifts of unquoted shares in trading companies. Quoted shares qualify for relief only if they are shares in the donor's family company or, in the case of trustees, are shares in a company in which the trustees exercise not less than 25 per cent. of the voting rights. The amendment seeks to impose the more stringent requirement that the trustees must exercise not less than 50 per cent. of the voting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 25 per cent. test was chosen because it treats trustees in a similar way to individuals. Relief is available to an individual if he exercises not less than 25 per cent. of the voting rights in a company or, with his family, over 50 per cent. of the voting rights, with 5 per cent. being exercised by the donor himself. So, although the test for trustees is equivalent to the basic test for individuals, it is already somewhat tougher for trustees because their holding cannot be aggregated with any other to allow a transfer of shares to qualify for relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>453</span>
Obviously this is just a matter of drawing lines and there is room for argument. But the intention is to target companies in which the trust has a substantial interest. I believe that at 25 per cent. the test is about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Again, this is intended as an anti-avoidance measure. The points may already be covered. If the Financial Secretary says that that is the case I shall be well satisfied. We move the amendment purely to explore the Government's thinking behind this part of the schedule and to find out whether the grounds covered by the amendment are already satisfied by the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under schedule 14, the capital gains which can be held over on a gift of shares in a company in which the donor has a 5 per cent. or greater interest is reduced if the company has assets other than business assets. This is an anti-avoidance provision which restricts the benefit of gifts relief where a company is holding assets which are not used in its trade, but are in effect investments of the shareholders. The amendment further restricts relief in these circumstances by counting as business assets only those assets that have been used in the trade throughout the period of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is simply a question of drawing lines. One of the reasons why clause 124 and schedule 14 are being introduced is our anxiety about the extent to which gifts relief has been used in tax planning and some sophisticated avoidance schemes. However, here we have the balance about right. The fact that an asset is not used in a company's trade throughout the period of ownership does not imply that it is simply an investment being held by the company for tax purposes. For that reason, to go beyond the test in the Bill probably would be over restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends are looking forward to hearing a substantial contribution from me on schedule 15 later this evening, I shall not weary the Committee too long on matters relating to schedule 14. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Baker) for drawing to my attention the amendments. He is an experienced solicitor and has taken leading counsel's advice about the proper taxation of trusts. The two amendments have been drafted by experienced leading counsel, as a result of instructions from my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has had the opportunity of studying the amendments and, in those circumstances, it is not necessary for me to go through them in considerable detail. Amendment No. 395 aims to give relief where property passes out of a trust to a beneficiary of an accumulation and maintenance trust, as defined in section 71 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, or to a life tenant, whatever his age. Therefore, it deals with two cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 396 is narrower. It aims to give relief where property passes out of a trust to a beneficiary aged 25 or under, providing that it is under either an accumulation and maintenance trust or one in which the beneficiary has a life interest. It seeks to deal with one case only—the young beneficiary trust—but it has to have two limbs because so many of the trusts that need relief will have evolved from accumulation and maintenance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
trusts to life interests trusts before the property vests in the beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go into considerable detail about those interesting and arcane matters. If Lord Rees were here, he would be anxious that we should have the opportunity of exploring the full limits of that. It is known already that the Government are considering the taxation of trusts and the beneficiaries of trusts. It is not expected that my right hon. Friend will complete his review particularly quickly. I want him to consider seriously whether the amendments, which were initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North, can be incorporated in due course into the results of his review. What is on offer to my right hon. Friend is not often on offer—the expert advice of extremely expensive leading tax counsel, which will come to him free. Such offers are not often made and so my right hon. Friend will find that attractive. As I know that so many of my hon. Friends look forward to hearing me later, I shall leave matters now to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) has raised two appropriate points that I have considered carefully since he tabled his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 395 is designed to preserve capital gains tax gifts relief where a trust has been set up for a minor child and property leaves the trust to go absolutely to a child when the child reaches a specified age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had several representations on accumulation and maintenance trusts. A special inheritance tax exemption exists for property leaving an accumulation and maintenance trust when a child reaches the stipulated age, so there is already recognition in the tax system of the special position of such trusts. But my hon. Friend knows that the rationale for the withdrawal of gifts relief is to avoid the double charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's case deserves careful consideration. Many accumulation and maintenance trusts are set up on someone's death, and the property only goes into trust to look after the children of the deceased because they are minor. Had they been adult, the property would have been left to them absolutely. I have considerable sympathy with my hon. Friend's point and, if he withdraws his amendment, I shall consider bringing forward an amendment to meet it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 395 also preserves gifts relief in different circumstances for an interest-in-possession trust set up for a child and property passes outright to the child at an age up to the 25th birthday. Amendment No. 396 goes further and preserves gifts relief wherever property leaves an interest-in-possession trust and goes to the beneficiary, whether that beneficiary was a child or an adult. There is no inheritance tax charge in those circumstances. That reflects the general inheritance tax principle that property held in an interest-in-possession trust is taxed broadly as though it were the property of the beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
However, the capital gains tax approach is different. Subject to some limited anti-avoidance rules, interest-in-possession trusts are taxed on their gains only at the basic rate: no attempt is made to impose a higher rate charge where the beneficiary would have paid higher rate tax if he had made the gains himself. I understand my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be an argument for saying that we ought to move more towards the inheritance tax approach and tax the trust's gains as if they had been made by the beneficiary, but that would be complicated. As long as most interest-in-possession trusts are treated as independent taxpayers and have only a basic rate charge on gains, there is some difficulty in arguing for gifts relief when property passes from them to the beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend pointed out that we are reviewing the taxation of trusts. As I have explained, that is slightly more complicated then the accumulation and maintenance trusts for which I hope to bring forward an amendment. I wish to consider the taxation of trusts in the context of our general review of trusts as some matters have a bearing on others. I assure my hon. Friend that I shall consider the matter constructively and hope that with that assurance he will seek to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to clarify one small point. Am I right in assuming that if a landowner farms land and hands it on, the roll over will continue as the land is classed as a business, but if the land if farmed by a tenant and the landowner hands it on, he will not get the benefit of the roll-over relief? If my assumption is correct, there is an incentive for landowners not to let land to tenants. Surely the Government would not want to encourage something that restricted the opportunities for young farmers to get on the farming ladder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After my right hon. Friend the Minister's immensley helpful response to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell), I, too, await his reply to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend). That is because I wish to make a brief contribution on let land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to what my right hon. Friend may say, the short answer is that the matter is more complex than my hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
believes. An anomaly in the present proposals is that some let land would be relieved but other let land would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before explaining that, however, I draw to the Committee's attention a problem that has been referred to me by the National Farmers Union. It concerns the dear, dead days of the Finance Act 1978 and the beginnings of relief from the dreaded double impost of capital gains tax and capital transfer tax. Among the original reliefs give for business assets was one given in circumstances where a farmer had retired and had then let his land to a member of his family. For some reason that long-standing relief, which goes back to a Labour Government, has not been re-enacted in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general issue of let land, we need to do a bit more tidying up. There is a real danger of a disincentive to farmers to let their land, or an unfairness to those who have already let land that they may wish to gift on. My understanding is that this can be done in some categories; where the land is owner-occupied; where land is let and may become vacant within a year; and let land where the tenancy was granted before 10 March 1981, or where the landlord would have qualified at that date for the working farmer relief. Those are small categories, but they establish the apparent anomalies in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the following suggestion for my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to consider between now and Report. It would be much easier, and would clean up the schedule, if we could apply the test of allowing the relief against capital gains tax to all agricultural property qualifying for inheritance tax agricultural property relief. That means that there would be one system that would apply to both cases. That would introduce simplicity and safeguard the maintenance of a reasonable number of agricultural tenancies. It need not open the doors to any malign purpose or a long-term strategy for treating let land as a trade, which sometimes worries the Revenue, because it would secure, or retain, existing relief rather than expand its scope. Furthermore, it would not give rise to tax avoidance because, to qualify for inheritance tax relief, the land would need to have been owned and occupied throughout the seven years prior to the gift. It would not be possible just to pick it up on the market and merchant it on to avoid gains tax on the gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington exposed the problem in the schedule. Some of its complexities were already overt. I shall be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister will respond to the issue either tonight or before Report, as some improvements could be made to the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the anxiety expressed by the hon. Member for Bridlington (Mr. Townend). He was alert enough to spot the problem in the Bill, even though it may be qualified in the way in which the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) expertly described. As the hon. Member for Bridlington said, anything within the tax system that provides a disincentive to landowners to let land, or provides
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
an incentive to them to take land into hand is, in the current agriculture climate, undesirable. I hope that the Minister will go through the schedule with a toothcomb to ensure that it does not—either by changes that it will make or by failing to continue existing reliefs—provide another incentive to landlords to reduce the number of tenanted farms available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency in which many farms are tenanted, and in which opportunities would be hugely diminished if pressures were increased to take land into hand. We have seen that happen over the years. It is fair to say that some landlords have been reluctant to take land in hand because they believe in the tenancy systems. However, a few landlords have had their fingers burnt by taking on more land than they could cope with and more than they could farm successfully themselves. The landlord-tenanted system is under considerable threat, and the Minister must take great care not to add to that threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends and the hon. Gentleman underlined the importance of agricultural landlords, especially in respect of new and young farmers. I am sure that all my hon.

	<p>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can move expeditiously through clause 125 and the remainder of the items that fall to be considered. I spent six years working for housing associations and co-operatives prior to being elected to the House of Commons, and I give a warm welcome to clause 125. I have only three questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what precisely is the meaning of
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than under a bargain at arm's length?</p></blockquote>
A similar phrase occurs in the previous clause; it is nowhere defined within this clause. Presumably, there is a standard legal meaning for it. It appears to qualify fairly sharply the provisions of the clause, and it would be useful to have a definifition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the provision, which affects a registered housing association, apply also to a registered housing co-operative? If a disposal is made to a co-operative rather than to a housing association in the traditional meaning of the word, does the relief which is applied under the clause apply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question relates to the position of charitable housing associations. The clause brings the provision for non charitable registered housing associations into line with those for charitable housing associations, yet it refers only to registered housing associations without specifying whether they could be charitable or non-charitable. Are all housing associations, whether charitable or non-charitable, now enfolded within the provisions of this clause rather than any pre-existing legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Government can give us rapid answers to those three simple questions. I look forwards to hearing from the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One sentence will suffice to thank the Government for introducing this initiative, which has united the Committee. It meets the longstanding interest that many of us share in improving the position in rural affordable housing in particular, and the continuing campaign by the Country Landowners Association. It is pleasant that we are united on the objective and on the means by which it is being carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) for his welcome for the clause and to the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). The hon. Gentleman asked three questions. The first related to the term
	<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than under a bargain at arm's length".</p></blockquote>
As he said, it is a term that is deployed elsewhere in the tax system, which is why it is not defined. It means a gift or sale for less than market value. Beyond that I cannot go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret to say that I am advised that I am unable to answer the hon. Gentleman's second question about registered housing co-operatives. I shall investigate that and come back to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was whether the measure would apply to charitable as well as non-charittable housing associations. As he said, the provision extends the relief to non-charitable housing associations but, as he will know, a charitable housing association is an exempt body, therefore, I do not think that there is any problem. The answer is tht it would apply to both types of association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. The point about housing co-operatives is important and I suspect that there would be no difference between the two sides of the Commitee in wishing to make the provision available both to registered associations and registered co-operatives. I trust that if the answer that the Financial Secretary unearths is unsatisfactory, the Government and Opposition can unite in bringing forward further measures on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>NON-RESIDENT CARRYING ON PROFESSION OR VOCATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 407, in page 93, line 39, leave out "of the deemed disposal" nd insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the profession of vocation began to be carried on in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency, if earlier than the actual date of acquisition".</p></blockquote>
Clause 126 is an anti-avoidance measure, requiring capital gains tax to be charged on non-resident persons carrying out a profession or vocation, as opposed to a trade, in the United Kingdom. Previously, although such persons were intended to be covered, the tax law wording was imprecise. The clause seeks to clarify and tighten up the provisions and, broadly speaking, we support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a technical change in the clause requiring that those individuals carrying out a trade or profession are deemed to have immediately disposed of their assets on Budget day this year and reacquired them at market value at that date. That means that assets previously used in the United Kingdom for the purpose of carying on a trade or vocation which had accrued value before March 1989 will have limited exposure to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would eliminate that benefit of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
limited exposure. It would require that the market value rule be applied only if an asset was owned before the profession or vocation was carried on in the United Kingdom, such that it was deemed to have been acquired at market value at the date of commencement of such an activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to ensure that all gain arising over the period of the activity when the profession or vocation is being carried out should be within the United Kingdom capital gains tax charge. We see no particular merit in the proposed cut-off point, which appears to be more favourable than is necessary to the taypayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) has explained what the amendment is designed to do. I shall leave aside the fact that that is not what the amendment would actually achieve. I shall consider the merits of the hon. Gentleman's argument rather than the amendment itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, we are bringing non-residents with a profession or vocation carried on in the United Kingdom within our capital gains charge for the first time. It seems extraordinary that that has not happened before. Hitherto, the charge has been confined to non-residents with a trade carried on here. For professions and vocations, the Bill limits the taxable gains to gains measured from Budget day. That accords with the normal position when assets are brought within the capital gains charge for the first time. That is what happened in 1965 when capital gains tax was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have amended the rates of capital gains, this small clause, which extends what capital gains tax applies to, is one of the first changes for many years, so the precedent set in 1965 is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking of avoidance in this clause, and to go further—taxing pre-Budget gains—would involve unjustifiable retrospection. We are simply extending the base to which the tax applies. It would be advisable to follow the precedent set in 1965 with the introduction of the charge. This is an extension of the base of the tax, not an anti-avoidance measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We welcome the clause as it stops people taking the benefit of deferment of capital gain and then ceasing to be resident in the United Kingdom. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
amendment seeks to strengthen the extent of the protection in circumstances where somebody subsequently moves outside the United Kingdom, even though they may be resident here when the tax is determined. The amendment seeks to ensure that the person should remain resident for the succeeding six years. It would seem that no period appears to be specified in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 129(2), roll-over relief will be available subject to the usual conditions if a non-resident disposes of United Kingdom business assets, becomes resident, and then acquires, within the qualifying period, replacement assets. The amendment would restrict relief in these circumstances to cases where the business man becomes resident for at least six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, this would mean that claims to relief could not be settled until the six year period had passed, so cases would be kept open for a long time. That must be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) in framing his amendment, probably had in mind the possibility that a non-resident may become resident for a short period, and then go non-resident again, simply to secure roll-over relief. I think that that is unlikely to happen. By becoming resident, even for a sort period, the business man will expose himself to liability to United Kingdom tax on all his income and gains in the period. We can keep the matter under review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his usual acute touch, the Financial Secretary has identified the point that concerns us, which is the possibility that someone might become resident for a short period but then become non-resident again, and might gain a tax advantage as a result of this.

	<br><blockquote><p>"sauch longer period as the Board may by notice in writing allow."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be an open-ended provision for the board. It would be useful to know what the Government have in mind and whether they are approaching the matter on ad hoc basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause enables a taxpayer who disposes of certain business assets to defer any liability to capital gains tax where the disposal proceeds are reinvested in replacement business assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 129 ensures that non-residents carrying on business in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency can only roll over capital gains into replacement assets which are within the United Kingdom tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides a corresponding change to the roll-over relief rules for dual resident companies. Without a change to the roll-over rules, it would be simple for a dual resident company to dispose of an asset within the United Kingdom tax charge under the terms of a tax treaty, and to roll over the gain into a replacement asset outside the United Kingdom tax charge under the treaty. The clause prevents that from happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with clause 129, the change applies where either the old asset is sold or the new asset is acquired on or after Budget day. However, again as with clause 129, there is an exception. Because of the way in which the roll-over relief works, some people may have acquired the replacement asset, although the old asset is not sold until, on or after Budget day. In those circumstances, money will have been expended in the expectation of the relief, so it would be wrong to deprive them of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) queried the words in subsection (3). I am informed that they parallel the general position for roll-over relief. There is a general discretion, which is rarely used, to extend the time limit for replacing business assets and the wording reflects that in precisely the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause covers non-payment of tax by non-resident companies. It provides that if tax is due by a non-resident company on disposals of assets arising after 14 March 1989 and the tax remains unpaid for six months, there is a right to collect the tax from other parties. The parties from whom the tax may be collected include companies in the same group and controlling directors of the company. The right seems to exist under the clause for up to three years from the time when the tax was finally determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would extend that period to six years, which would provide extra scope for the Inland Revenue to recover the unpaid tax. The amendment is a sensible one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will not be thought unduly provocative at this late hour to say that I wish that the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-year period, which the hon. Gentleman wishes to extend to six years, mirrors the provisions that were introduced last year on migrating companies. Given that we introduced a three-year limit then, it is logical to have the same period in the clause as in the general migrating companies clause last year. We believe that three years is an adequate period for the Revenue to pursue companies' liabilities elsewhere. If that is not the case, we shall consider it, but it is the view held by the Revenue and the Government and it mirrors what we did last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfied with the Financial Secretary's response and I should want to take issue with him on the subject of cutting taxes. As the Government have increased the tax burden as a proportion of GDP from 34½ per cent. to 37.1 per cent. during the past 10 years, that is a bit rich.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have taken a large number of Government amendments on the nod so perhaps it would be appropriate for me to explain what the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause extends exemption from capital gains tax and corporation tax on gains to disposals of non-convertible sterling bonds currently within the tax net. Qualifying corporate bonds are already exempt from capital gains tax. One of the conditions for this exemption has been that bonds must be quoted on the United Kingdom stock exchange or dealt in on the unlisted securities market, or issued by a United Kingdom company or other body with shares or securities quoted on the stock exchange or dealt in on the unlisted securities market. The clause removes that condition, allowing non-convertible sterling bonds generally, whether issued by a United Kingdom or foreign company, listed in this country or not, to qualify for exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change removes a tax advantage which sterling bonds issued abroad have over those issued in the United Kingdom. For example, where foreign issues take the form of floating rate notes or fixed interest bonds the value remains relatively constant so that any normal gain or loss is likely to be negligible. But because such bonds are within the scope of capital gains tax the application of the indexation rules will generally result in a capital loss. That can give bonds listed overseas an added attraction for United Kingdom lenders with gains elsewhere against which those losses can be set. There has been evidence over the last year or 18 months that bond issues designed to exploit this tax advantage have been increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I could go on and would be happy to do so if the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) wanted me to, the point is that the clause paradoxically, and Irish though it may seem, takes those bonds out of the capital gains tax net simply because the bonds are being issued to establish indexation losses for capital gains tax purposes. That is the fundamental point about the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel that all my life so far has been a preparation for this moment. A substantial amendment is on the amendment paper. I appreciate that, with their preoccupations, not all my hon. Friends have been able to give the amendment their whole and undivided attention during the past few hours. My hon. Friends the Members for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) have been very preoccupied, so say nothing of the huge and noble endeavours of the Opposition Front Bench. If it will assist the Committee, I am happy to read out the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The purpose of printing the amendment is to make it unnecessary for the hon. Member to read it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment's purpose is to introduce a straight line growth valuation for the 1982 re-basing of capital gains tax instead of taking the market value on 6 April 1982 as the base in all cases. Under the introduction of capital gains tax in 1965, for which the Opposition feel real affection, certain assets were allowed for a straight line growth valuation as at April 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With its complicated mathematical formulae, this long amendment seeks only to do precisely the same for 1982. It adapts the relevant provisions of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, in relation to 1965 straight line growth, to 1982 conditions. It has been argued that that might be unacceptable because it would introduce circumstances where a value in 1982 might be different for inheritance tax purposes as against capital gains tax purposes. That would have been the position in 1965 between capital gains tax and the then estate duty and it was not embarrassing at that time. There is no reason why a valuation should be the same for both taxes, because one tax is on the full value of an asset and the other on a gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will be of particular assistance to the holders of shares in unquoted companies—the Committee and my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary know of my interest in the unquoted companies sector—where the traditional method of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>469</span>
valuation is other than on a sale is by reference to a heavy discount, if a minority of shares is held. When value is finally realised from an unquoted company's shares on a sale, it is generally on the sale of the whole company. Since in those circumstances the price received by the minority shareholders is the same per share as that received by the others, the introduction of a straight line basis of valuation will alleviate considerably what will otherwise be an extraordinary anomaly. On the sale of an unquoted company in 1990, held by the same shareholders who existed in 1982, the amount of the gain that the minority shareholders will be deemed to have made will be proportionately much greater than that of the majority shareholders because their base valuation will be much lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment, even at this late stage, because it will be of considerable importance to the unquoted sector and to the holders of minority shares in unquoted companies. That cause deserves the Committee's attention and approbation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year we re-based capital gains tax to 1982, so that only gains since 1982 are not within the tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend wishes to introduce a different approach of time-apportionment. So to take a straightforward example, if an asset was brought in 1972 and sold in 1992, and the gain over the whole period of ownership was £50,000, half the period of ownership would be after 1982, and the taxpayer would be able to elect to be taxed on £25,000, or half the gain over the whole period of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention, having decided to re-base from 1982, is that real gains accruing since 1982 should be taxed. In principle, it must be right to measure those gains by reference to 1982 market values. Any alternative of time-apportionment would, by definition, produce arbitrary results. If one had an asset whose value declined before 1982 and rose after 1982, and netted it off, that would be an arbitrary result. Our objective is to tax post-1982 gains. My hon. Friend must remember that we have re-based, because we are not able to carry indexation backwards, and to take account of inflation in the past. We have indexation in the system now to take account of inflation after 1982. That fundamental point lies behind my resistance to my hon. Friend's case. Having taken out gains before 1982 and re-based, and having catered for inflation after 1982, we must have capital gains tax to tax real gains post-1982, and not have arbitrary results from time apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether my hon. Friend agrees with what I have said, but I have two further points to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>470</span>
make. First, many people argue for time-apportionment, which I have discussed many times with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), but it is not as simple as it appears, especially in relation to share-pooling, which is extremely compicated. Secondly, none of those arguments counts with my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell). I do not expect that this one will, but if the amendment were applied to all assets acquired before 1982, the cost of the amendment could well be over £1,000 million. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) said earlier, it is the principle, not the price of principle, which counts. I assure my hon. Friend that it is not the £1 billion but the principle that matters, to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend's argument will persuade my hon. Friends to support the amendment rather than to reject it, because the idea that we could reduce tax by £1 billion is an attractive proposition. I shall disappoint my hon. Friends because I tabled the amendment to give me the opportunity to probe the Government's thinking on why straight line re-basing should not be allowed. We shall now be able to analyse the Government's reasons and, in due course, we shall return to them. I know that people such as my hon. Friends the Members for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who study the amendment paper carefully, will be aware of a new clause tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Sir W. Clark). We may wish to consider those matters further on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall disappoint my hon. Friends and deny them the opportunity to vote for a reduction in tax of £1 billion or more. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly put that to the Committee, but to get the procedure straight, I remind the Committee that if one hon. Member dissents from the withdrawal of an amendment, it may not be withdrawn. I mention that in passing because the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) may misunderstand the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Schedule 15 agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[	<i>Mr. Alan Howarth.</i>]</p>
