	<time>Thursday 6 April 1989</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[MR. ANTHONY MEYER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 35</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>BORROWING LIMITS ETC</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 43, line 15, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) When determining any question relating to borrowing a local authority shall have regard to any Code of Practice or other guidance issued by a local authority association, the Audit Commission, or the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.".</p></blockquote>
I wish to ask the Minister why more power is needed. The clause introduces a power for the Secretary of State to regulate borrowing
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of prudent financial management".</p></blockquote>
The provision gives the Secretary of State scope that is not needed. We prefer a requirement that is based on self-regulation by local government with independent bodies, such as the Audit Commission, in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill introduces a regulatory regime to determine the borrowing requirements that will be introduced, but that leaves open whether they may be tightened in future. The significant words are
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of prudent financial management".</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor sold his Budget this year on the basis that it was prudent, but that word may be interpreted ambiguously. At the very least, there may be controversy about its meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wholly unnecessary for the Secretary of State to have a power to interfere when most local authorities follow a voluntary code of good practice. In addition, there are independent back-ups. The new system would confer on the Secretary of State a reserve power, exercisable with the consent of the Treasury, to make regulations at a latter date to conform to the Government's definition of "prudent borrowing" instead of the local authority's or independent body's definition. There may be conflict. Regulations may require that the ratio between the amount of a local authority's short-term borrowing and its annual revenue should not exceed a prescribed level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A double standard is beginning to emerge on borrowing. The Government often suggest that borrowing is not desirable, yet half the junk mail that we all receive encourages and exhorts people to borrow more and to move towards a cashless society and plastic money. It is striking that one person may be in debt and blamed for it—the debt may be only £150—but if someone else uses a credit card to borrow £150, he is said to be in credit. It seems that one person's credit is another's debt, depending on who makes the judgment although both may have borrowed exactly the same amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local councils cannot play the markets, especially the financial market, because they are fettered. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
cannot take advantage of short-term changes in the money rate or interest rates. They are fettered, but 17-year-old computer whizzkids can break into systems and play the market through telephone boxes when councils are not allowed, by law, to make short-term money in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, the Government would say of the money market that it can and should be self-regulating. Why can there be self-regulation in the city and not in local government? If the answer is that the Government must contain and control local authority borrowing powers in all circumstances, that implies that the Government do not trust local authorities to organise their own borrowing, even within the context set out in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least, if the Government intend to leave this clause in the Bill, they should define the exact nature and extent of the reserve powers of the Secretary of state over local authority borrowing to remove any vagueness in subsection (2) and the uncertainty that could be left in the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give details of the powers available to constrain local authority borrowing and say how they will be used? I trust that she will accept our argument that it is greatly preferable to have self-regulation in local government with support from the independent bodies which, I hope we all agree, can provide the necessary background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our proceedings, occasional references have been made to the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and its various financial arrangements. Amendment No. 273 states that, in any question relating to borrowing,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a local authority shall have regard to any Code of Practice".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps this is a convenient time to ask the Government for their proposals to deal with the problems to which the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has been drawn to an article in 	<i>The Independent</i> on 30 March, from which I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Banks caught up in the potentially illegal money market dealings by local authorities have been sounding out the Government about introducing early legislation to clear up the confusion."</p></blockquote>
If the Government are minded to respond to those representations, the vehicle for clearing up any confusion is the clause—and, indeed, the Bill—that we are considering. This matter has been referred to from time to time during our proceedings, and I understand that the Bank of England has been involved in the general debate and shares the concern about the potential damage which the affair may do to the reputation of the City of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have said that these matters must wait for the courts to judge whether any illegality has occurred and, if so, what are the legalities. If we proposed some kind of action in this Bill in the way that my hon. Friend the Minister for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) suggests before the courts made a decision—and we understand that there are cases pending—it would be wholly improper. This is a matter for the courts to decide.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
When they have done so, we shall have to decide what must be done in the light of that judgment. To do so in advance would prejudice any decision that the courts might make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my right hon. Friend's point, but does he have any idea of the timescale within which the courts might resolve this matter? I understand that the legal process could take several years, during which there would be uncertainty about the legality of swaps and, if they were held to be legal, to what extent local authorities could indulge in them. If the legal position may not be resolved for some time, are the Government happy to leave matters as they are with this cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market? That is a perfectly tenable position for the government, but it would help if it were known that they did not mind the legality of swaps being left unclarified until the courts got round to giving a definitive ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it would be proper for the Government to speculate on what a court case should be or how long it might take. It is important that the courts are independent of government and take their own decisions. I have no control over the timing of court proceedings, but I understand that the Audit Commission hopes that there will be a hearing before the summer. I have heard in great detail the problems that have been faced by my right hon. and hon. Friends, but this is neither the time nor the place to make the sort of alteration that is being pressed on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister and shall not press the matter further. Perhaps during the debate my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment will clarify whether the code of practice that might have been produced under the amendment would cover the matter. Under the amendment, a code of practice would be issued by
	<br><blockquote><p>"a local authority association, the Audit Commission, or the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy."</p></blockquote>
If the matter will not be resolved until the courts have dealt with it, presumably a code of practice under the amendment would have to wait for the court's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the matter further. The Government have made their position clear and note will be taken of my right hon. Friend's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ealing, Action (Sir George Young) is on to a good point. The Minister for Local Government should not try to hide behind the courts. The Government have made an appalling mess and the Minister knows it. That is why the banks and some of his hon. Friends have approached me and others, asking us to table amendments to change the law. I have received an amendment from solicitors acting on behalf of the banks. It arrived rather late in the day and I am not convinced that it is the best available. They are anxious because the Secretary of State had an opportunity to allow local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
to trade out sensibly using the market, but he did not do that, which has caused problems for the banks and local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have been able to arrange the best financial deals on their borrowing over a period, but because the Government keep changing the rules, they have forced local authorities to go beyond the best extent to go. The Government created that situation. Hammersmith and Fulham has done very nicely out of that, and has a £13 million trading profit. The Minister may laugh, but I have suggested that Hammersmith and Fulham buys his Suffolk, Coastal constituency and turns it into a theme park. The Minister could have a lead role as Donald Duck. We have done so well and managed to have one of the lowest rate rises in the country of just 3 per cent. The Minister is now saying that we cannot trade out at the time that the market says is the best time to do so. That is ludicrous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not mislead the Committee. The Government have not done what he wants because they could not. The Secretary of State does not have the power to legalise illegal transactions and he could not have authorised Hammersmith and Fulham to trade its way out of that. That is the legal position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the Government may not comment on the matter until the courts have clarified their position. He is making scurrilous and outrageous statements in an attempt to defend a local council that has been commented on in the press. The hon. Gentleman is a lone and rather peculiar voice, but he must not suggest to the Committee that the Government could have made legal that which is illegal. The law is not such, nor should it be so. Whether such action is legal or illegal is a matter for the courts. I would not wish the Government to interfere in the way in which courts decide the law of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That must have been the longest intervention on record; it demonstrated the Minister's desperation. Such practice is not illegal. The way in which the Minister twists the English language to suit his purposes is an example of how the Government try to hide behind the courts. It is not illegal, and it has never been suggested that it is. What has been suggested is that no one knew whether it was ultra vires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister should ask the Audit Commission what its advice was a year or so ago. That important qestion would be relevant to the Audit Commission, the Government and local authorities. The Government cannot hide behind their allegation that such action is illegal, or behind the absurd statement that, somehow or other, the Secretary of State is being asked to make something legal that was illegal. No one has ever asked him to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister makes such statements, he must understand that he is not just criticising me or some of my hon. Friends, but the banks, many of his hon. Friends in Committee and elsewhere and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
Conservative councillors who have indulged in similar activities. The right hon. Gentleman is saying that they completely misunderstood the law. The method is not illegal. The argument is whether it is ultra vires, and the Minister was able to ensure that that aspect was dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use the Minister shaking his head and saying, "No". Everyone knows that he could have dealt with the matter. Discussions among the Bank of England, other bankers, various legal people and the auditors confirm that. The Minister's saying no to my statement is blatantly misleading. It is not true. He knows that what I am saying is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Anthony. Is it proper for a member of the Committee to suggest that another member of the Committee said something that is not true? What I said was strictly accurate. Even if it were not, it is not in order—as I understand the procedures of the House—for an hon. Member to say that the remarks of another member of the Committee were untrue. The hon. Gentleman has said much that I believe is not true, but I would not accuse him of such in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very fine line between accusing a member of the Committee of telling an untruth, and saying that what he said is not correct. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be careful in his choice of language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not accusing the Minister of lying; I am just saying that what he said is not true. A lie is a deliberate intention to deceive. When a person says something that is not true, he may not have the intention to deceive. I am not accusing the Minister of deliberating intending to deceive the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the Minister has misused the English language. It is no use his trying to hide. He is embarrassed by the fact that the Government have created a mess which is, as the hon. Member for Ealing, Action rightly said, likely to last for a year or two for Labour, Liberal and Conservative local authorities as well as for the banks, auditors and others involved. The Minister has no right to behave in that way. It is wrong from everyone's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way forward may not be to accept the suggestions of the banks or to follow the point made by the hon. Member for Ealing, Action, but the Government must rapidly make it clear that local authorities can trade out in the best interests not only of the people in their areas, but of the market generally. That would allow the situation to decline. At the same time, the Government should set guidelines for borrowing policy in the future. That would be a simple way out of the trap. The Government have created mayhem in the market because of their political ideas, which are completely unacceptable even to the banks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
welcome the support of the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) for many of the codes of practice produced by the local authority associations, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, and the Audit Commission. We want good practice in local government and we welcome the suggestion that high regard should be paid to those codes of practice. It is a welcome development, because when the Local Government Finance Bill was debated a year ago, the Opposition Front Bench moved an amendment to delete CIPFA from the list of professional accountancy bodies to which local authority chief finance officers would have to belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The positive aspect of the amendment is unnecessary because there is nothing in the clause to stop a local authority having regard to codes of practice or other guidance issued by the Audit Commission, CIPFA or the local authority associations. However, the amendment raises difficult questions. There are five local authority associations and, with the Audit Commission and CIPFA, that makes seven bodies. There might be confusion if the different bodies issued different codes of practice. Furthermore, what would happen if a local authority, having had regard to a code of practice, nevertheless decided to do something different?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that it was a new step for the Government to seek the power to make regulations under subsection (2). However, it is only a reserve power and it is not envisaged that it will be used unless voluntary codes of practice proved ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the occasions on which the power would be used. At present, there is an agreement that local authorities should ensure that the average term of their borrowing is more than seven years. If that were flouted, the Government could make regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Leeds, West that this is not a new principle in local government law and regulations. There is at present on the statute book the Borrowing (Control and Guarantees) Act 1946, which was passed by a Labour Government and which provides the wherewithal for rather drastic controls over local authority borrowing, although the restrictions specified in the Control of Borrowing Order 1958 and the general consent given under it are fairly mild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that the measure is nothing new and that we still hope that local authorities will have regard to the codes of practice produced by the local authority associations. We believe that the regulation-making power should exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the debate and to my hon. Friend's answer. Would not the information that she has given to the Committee have been available to the councillors who run the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham? Does that not demonstrate the scale of their irresponsibility and the risk to the ratepayers and people of that borough arising from their actions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Audit Commission issued guidance and warnings on these matters in 1987 and 1988, which were widely available. One does not know whether they were heeded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. The hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) is wrong, of course. The decision made by officers, at the initiative of the Conservative council, allowed a wide discretion to officers. Whether that is wise or good is a separate matter, which should be debated. It is being debated in Hammersmith and Fulham by all parties. It is important to understand, however, that the Audit Commission report was not made available to councillors. Members of the Committee should be aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister has responded fully to those points. Those matters are before the courts and it is outrageous of the hon. Member for Hammersmith to accuse the Government of hiding behind legal processes. We believe in the rule of law and it is right and proper to let those processes take their course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend tell the Opposition that, not only was a notice issued in July 1987 by the Audit Commission that warned local authorities, a press notice was issued at that time and a report appeared in the local government press but, in July 1988, when the Audit Commission circulated a legal opinion that gave clear limits on the type and scale of swaps that were acceptable, it was reported in the national press? It is wholly unacceptable to claim that councillors in any London borough were unaware of those matters because the truth is that, in July 1987, and again in July 1988, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Audit Commission made them extremely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend and I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady thinks that the Minister is right, why did the Conservative members of Croydon council, who lost £3 million on those deals, not know about those matters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that my right hon. Friend stated the case clearly. The provision that we are discussing will ensure that people who lend money to a local authority will not lose if, for any reason, the borrowing is ultra vires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) asked whether there is power in subsection (2) to make regulations to deal with those matters. I advise him that those matters relate to borrowing as opposed to more general financial transactions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not need to prolong the debate, although much more could be said on the subject. Unfortunately, the Government have got themselves into a mess and they cannot get out of it quickly. There are ways out of the trap and I advise the Government that, although we cannot resolve the
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
problem here and now because of the way in which it has gone forward, they could back track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no reason to beat Croydon council with a stick. It was in a similar position to other authorities but lost money on its dealings instead of making it like Hammersmith and Fulham. Nor do I have reason to beat other Conservative, Liberal or Labour authorities which have done well or badly, irrespective of political control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely all members of the Committee have an interest in ensuring that local authorities can trade by using the market in the best interests of their ratepayers and by using the banks, which are also embarrassed by what has occurred. If we allow them to do that, we must ensure that guidelines are laid down to prevent a recurrence of circumstances in which local authorities believe that they can go beyond a sensible level of loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Committee would find that acceptable in most cases but, given the uncertaintly about local government finance that has been created by the Government in the past few years, we cannot suddenly attack treasurers and councillors in various, local authorities and accuse them of being irresponsible. Those who have been irresponsible are the Government, who failed to tackle the problem in the first instance and, after it had arisen, did not allow local authorities to trade sensibly and neglected to issue guidelines to ensure that such future dealings were kept within sensible boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to press the issue, but we shall return to it. Sadly, it appears that that might take some time because, as the Minister correcty stated, the matter is now before the courts. The problem occurred because of the Government's incompetence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to justify the hon. Gentleman's remarks—it is the problem that is now before the courts. And he might be more worried if it were not. It would be improper for me to comment further about the specific transactions in which Hammersmith and Fulham were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few years, the Government have repeatedly said that they will not stand behind local authorities' financial commitments. The Audit Commission has often drawn attention to that problem. There is no more to be said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to ensure that local authorities discharge their responsibilities in a financially sound and prudent manner. The clause is about borrowing limits. I hope the points raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, West have been covered, and that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that, like the Minister of State, the Under-Secretary fo State is now trying to hide behind the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is outrageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
said that the law had been broken. The question that was asked was whether it was ultra vires. The Secretary of State can give dispensation to avoid a surcharge. Everyone knows that the chances of surcharge are close to zero. There are good reasons for that. If the hon. Lady or the Minister had talked to the Audit Commission, they would know why, but they would have to talk to the Audit Commission first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission knows that there has been a problem. It has been helpful, but it also knows that its early involvement needs revising and that the guidance given to councils was not clear. The Government, have already created a mess, and would be well advised to tread carefully. They do not need to make matters more difficult for Labour or Tory councils, or for the Audit Commission or the banks, yet they continue to make things worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has sat down, I shall answer the hon. Gentleman. It is about time that the Committee heard the truth about the legal situation. The Secretary of State has no power to sanction a payment or a receipt that would legalise a council's action and prevent others from suing it. The issue put forward by the hon. Member for Hammersmith is a smokescreen to cover his embarrassment at the press reports about the borough, part of which he represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with it by asking about Croydon or somewhere else. If another borough acts in a way that is found to be illegal or ultra vires by the courts, I shall be the first to condemn that action, whatever the political complexion of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What differentiates our side of the Committee from the Labour Benches is that the hon. Member for Hammersmith, who has an extremely difficult party position, seeks to use this opportunity to try to get out of a major press discussion of his council's actions by blaming the Government's inability to make a statement of the same sharpness as his, but the Government respect the law and believe that it is for the courts to decide what is ultra vires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Government are acting legally and properly and because the Secretary of State has no powers of the sort that the hon. Gentleman imputes to him, the hon. Gentleman is busy trying to spread the—no, I must use the word. [Hon. Members: "Go on!"] He is mixed up sufficiently partially in his mind to try to suggest that what everyone else sees as at best a miscalculation by one London borough, is the responsibility of a Government who have had nothing to do with it, or of an Audit Commission that warned about it in July 1987 and July 1988, both of which warnings were carried in the press and were available to everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Anthony. I fail to understand the direction that the Minister is taking, or that what he is saying has to do with the amendment. (Hon. Members: "Ah!"] May I proceed with this point of order without interruptions? I understood that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
amendment dealt with the treatment of future transactions. The whole of the Minister's argument has been based on past transactions which are now before the courts. How can he mix one with the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has ranged widely, but we are covering a general point of principle. The Minister has said nothing so far that is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comments of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) illustrate the Labour party's position exactly. It is using this opportunity to cover its embarrassment. The hon. Member for Hammersmith tried to throw mud at the Government, when the Government were in the right. We are waiting for the courts to decide. The mud, instead of sticking on the Government, has stuck so firmly to the hon. Member for Hammersmith that he must, yet again, explain the outrageous position in which he has put himself. No doubt he will get up again and again to try to cover with words the nakedness of the Hammersmith and Fulham council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Long may I be politically embarrassed by a £13 million profit and one of the lowest rate rises in the country. It is a pleasant state of embarrassment. The main point is that the Government created a problem which they could have prevented by the Secretary of State using his power of dispensation. It is no good the Minister saying that that is not so. The banks, solicitors and the Audit Commission wanted it. Tory, Labour and Liberal councils wanted it. No-one, except the Secretary of State, was against it. The Secretary of State has created chaos for himself, local authorities and the banks. He is also costing the taxpayer a fortune by putting through the courts something that need never have gone there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. From time immemorial, Secretaries of State have used their power of dispensation, quite appropriately, in such cases. The amendment suggested by the banks—there is sense in it—would, to some extent, put local authorities in the position of normal trading companies. If that were so, not only would other councils be able to say, "At least Hammersmith did it successfully, even if Croydon did not", but we would find that even the Minister would have to pat Hammersmith council on the back for having used the market effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, there is now no way in which we can get the Secretary of State out of the hole that he has dug for himself. We will have to wait and see what he does in due course. I urge the Government—for the sake of us all, not least for local authorities of all political complexions, banks and the Audit Commission, which is worried about how it has handled the problem—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is disgraceful and wholly untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. As I said earlier, the Audit Commission was helpful in dealing with the problem,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
but it knows that the difficulty was how the issue was identified and brought to the notice of councillors in the first place. This is not an attack on the Audit Commission. The Audit Commission recognised that the guidance to local authorities throughout the country was not effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon Gentleman like to explain to the Committee that the power has been used in similar cases in the past? Can he give me one single example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Previous Secretaries of State have used their power of dispensation correctly. The Minister must know that. Throughout history, Secretaries of State have used powers of dispensation. There is no reason why they should not. What they should not do—that is what worries the Minister—is to try to intervene in a court case. That is the trap that the Secretary of State has got himself into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no way in which we can resolve this now. The issue has been muddied by the Government and the Minister is being so defensive that he cannot take on board the offer on the table. Everybody wants to find a way in which to help local authorities, banks and everyone else involved. The Minister and the Secretary of State have the power to do that, and it is time that they used it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there should be no mistake in future, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that on no occasion has the Secretary of State used his power in a case like this. There has been no case like this and there is no power to do what the hon. Member for Hammersmith thinks can be done. The only power is to excuse councillors from surcharge. That does not stop the council being sued. Therefore, it does not remove the uncertainty, or the court cases and has none of the effects the hon. Gentleman thinks it has and it does not matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall finish what I am saying. What has happened this morning is yet another example of an attempt by a local authority to say that it does not want the courts to decide whether what it has done is legal. It does not want to face those issues and have them determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a country where the rule of law is paramount. It would be wholly improper for the Secretary of State to have taken any other steps than the ones he took. The hon. Member for Hammersmith does a disservice to his party, to Parliament and to the rule of law by trying to suggest that knowing he does so when the Government cannot answer point by point because those very issues are before the courts. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is misusing his position in Committee and doing so in a way that is deleterious not just to great things like the rule of law and parliamentarianism, but to his party which, in the past, has eschewed such action, knowing that it was beneath it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has about as much commitment to the rule of law as I think Attila the Hun had to democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I am not having a Government that use the law when they want to and turn against it when they want to. This Government have a dreadful record on the law. What matters is that the Secretary of State can give dispensation against surcharge to allow local authorities to trade out. That is the issue. It has nothing to do with breaking the law or the rule of law. If the Minister does not understand that, he should have obtained his briefings beforehand and not afterwards. If I had to keep running out of Committee for briefings every few minutes I would begin to worry about my competence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities of all complexions want to trade out, the Government could allow them to do that, but they have not. There is nothing about the rule of law in that, and the Bank of England and other banks did not worry about the rule of law. They, the Audit Commission, the local authorities rightly worried about the way to resolve the debt issues in the best interests of the market and the ratepayers. That is where the Government have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going wide on this issue. I suggest that we return to it when, hopefully, the Government have resolved it quickly or, if they do not, at some time in the future when the courts have made a decision on the cases that are now pending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit to the Committee that I did turn to ask for briefing because the last statement by the hon. Member for Hammersmith was so far from the truth that I could not believe my ears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth—we must make this absolutely clear—is that if the Secretary of State had removed the possibility of penalty of surcharge, that would not have enabled a council to have unwound its arrangements if they were illegal. The only way that that can happen is in front of a court. Some people may have hoped that, if there was no question of surcharge, no one of all those involved would have taken the case to court. That would be an extreme situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a very curious argument, because it implies that no one wishes to know what was legal or illegal. It is easy to pretend that the matter is immaterial, but it must be in the interests of a council, which no doubt believes that what it has done is legal, to establish legality. When that is done, the council may do as it wishes. Because people are innocent until proven guilty, it is improper for the Secretary of State to assume that they are guilty, and therefore to lift the possibility of surcharge. That is what is at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The competence of the hon. Member for Hammersmith is not in doubt. In this debate, he has shown himself wholly incompetent. He has not understood the legal position or, worse still, he has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
understood it but has misused it to cover what appears to have been a rather unhappy episode.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman were a lawyer, I would pay him not to defend me. He does not understand how the legal system works. His example was rather like my saying, "I will not answer any questions that the Minister asks because I think that the previous statement may have been illegal. I will check it first." It is nonsense. Everyone knows that the activity is legal because it is carried out by private companies, and is usually commended. Whether the local authority acted ultra vires is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving dispensation would have allowed trading out. There is no reason why that should not have happened. To pretend, as the Minister does, that there is something illegal about it because no one has previously tested the law, is wrong. It is not for the Secretary of State or the Minister to decide. If I wanted to take a local authority to court, that would be fine. It is not for the Secretary of State to assume that a local authority will be taken to court. It is the Secretary of State's job to work in the best interests of local authorities which he is supposed to represent, instead of doing them down all the time, and to try to help resolve the matter. Again, the Government have refused to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Anthony, but I ought to point out that if a local authority acts ultra vires, that becomes illegal. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is. There is no argument about it. The hon. Gentleman has tried to make a distinction without a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is clear. If a local council has acted in a way that is ultra vires, as the Audit Commission warned twice that is might be, it has acted illegally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If an action is ultra vires, it is illegal. The only question is whether the action was ultra vires. That can be decided only by the courts. The Secretary of State has no power to say that that which was ultra vires is now intra vires. Therefore, in the end, the only way that the matter can be unwound is by a decision of the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question that might arise outside that is whether it was, or is, prudent to become involved when large sums are at issue and an authority's vires are questionable. This is a difficult issue because, when a case is in the state that the one being discussed is in, Ministers are unwilling to prejudice the outcome. The question has been widely canvassed outside, so I understand why the hon. Gentleman has brought the matter to the Committee's attention, even though it is through the good nature of the Chair that we have been able to discuss it for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the hon. Member for Hammersmith to be a little more careful about his use of the legal situation. I have taken a great deal of care. Our purpose has been to act legally and in the best interests of all those involved. We have legislated not in the interests of the local authorities but in the interests of the people whom they represent, which is the responsibility of Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is clearly not prepared to act constructively. Many people in local authorities, banks and elsewhere will be disappointed by the Government's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand that the hon. Gentleman wishes to consider another amendment with this group so, if the Committee has no objection, I suggest that we also take amendment No. 275, in page 44, line 8, after "or", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in so far as it applies to the discharge of functions by officers".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the excitement of the past 20 minutes, the Committee will find that these amendments involve more nuts-and-bolts issues, although they are also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments No. 274 and 288 are consequential. Their purpose is to ensure that the credit approvals issued by the Secretary of State are received in good time to enable them to be incorporated in authorities' decisions under clause 36, at, say, the annual poll tax meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the issue should not be controversial, it is important. Local authorities must be able to programme how they spend money, irrespective of whether it is capital or revenue. They must have a context in which to determine their priorities and they must know exactly, and as soon as possible, what resources the Secretary of State will allow them to carry out their programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process is complex for metropolitan districts since the scrapping of the metropolitan counties a few years ago, as expenditure decisions by the bodies now responsible for the police, fire services, probation, passenger transport and waste disposal also affect the expenditure of metropolitan districts. The same principles, although not the same issues, apply to all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this morning I spoke to the deputy director of finance in my borough, Mr. Joe Drinkwater. He is a fine bloke, with whom I worked closely when I was chairman of first the housing committee and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
then the finance committee in Knowsley. As far as I know, he has no politics. He has not discussed them with me and I cannot envisage him twin-tracking. He read clause 36 and concluded that it is illogical. That is why we tabled the amendments. He does not say that in a political sense but as a practising, highly competent accountant in local government and manager of financial affairs in my borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Drinkwater asked why capital expenditure was treated differently from revenue expenditure. The clause does not appear to require revenue decisions to be taken similarly to those on capital decisions. Our proposal puts the onus on the Secretary of State to take his decisions in good time to enable the local authority to put together a sensible programme so that councillors and others can take their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 275 proposes the delegation to committees, rather than officers, of the duties to set borrowing policies. I think that it was in the autumn of 1981 that the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), in his pre-flack jacket days, was the Minister with responsibility for Merseyside—several people have taken on that mantle since. He came to meet the leaders of the local authorities. My authority told him that it wanted to take over the industrial estate in Kirkby—it is now in my constituency—which had previously been managed by Liverpool. It also wanted to do something about a local authority estate—Stockbridge village—with which the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier) is familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Secretary of state and the Labour local authority were able to resolve two problems in the middle of a financial year because the Secretary of State was flexibile, and willing to recognise that there were problems. He gave the required exceptional borrowing permission for the acquisition of Kirkby industrial estate and arranged a framework in which the management of Stockbridge village could be changed. That could not have happened if the council's financial regulations and standing orders had not been flexible enough to enable quick decisions to be taken by committees and then ratified by the local authority later, but before any final commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 275 seeks that flexibility to enable decisions to be taken, perhaps mid-term, for exceptional reasons. It is consistent because committees are often delegated to consider major policies which are scarcely discussed at council meetings because committees are trusted to take such policy decisions. That is the system of local government with which I am familiar and that is what we propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are sensible and try to deal with practical issues. They do not seek to be controversial but tackle local government generally, rather than the exceptions about which we hear too much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's presentation of the amendments. If there were a proper analogy to be drawn, I should not hesitate to follow the course suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
Perhaps I may explain why it is done in that way and where the difference arises. First, I hope that he will not be upset if I discuss the technicalities of the more complicated matter because there is a reason for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the hon. Gentleman seeks to draw a link between the basic credit approvals, which will be issued each year, and the borrowing limits which the local authorities will be required to determine for themselves under the provisions of the clause. On the face of it, that sounds absolutely right. Let us take the analogy of one's own private arrangements. If someone is given the power to borrow a certain amount, that is the total amount he is likely to borrow. The two come close together. With local authorities, however those approvals might be used in various ways, not all of which are related to external borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities have no external debt but have borrowing approvals, so they use their internal borrowing powers—that is, they borrow internally—to pay for their projects, with which they are allowed to proceed because of the borrowing approval. In such authorities, there is an absolute difference between their decision about their borrowing limits and the borrowing approvals—the credit approvals—that are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credit approvals also cover other means of financing that are outwith the concept of external borrowing, such as a leasing arrangement. That is covered under the Bill by the credit approvals, but it is not covered by the borrowing limits which a local authority would be required to determine for itself. The first reason for the provision is that the figure is not always the same. In many local authorities, it is much different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question is whether it is a matter that should be decided by the full council. The hon. Gentleman asked, perfectly rationally, whether there was a proper parallel with revenue. There is a direct parallel with revenue. The rate can be set only by the whole council, not by a committee. Community charges and precepts can be set only by the whole council. In a real sense, there is a parallel. If the whole council is to set the borrowing limit, it is not unreasonable that an alteration to that limit should also be set by the whole council. The borrowing limit is an extremely important part of the council's financial controls over itself. It is similar for Governments. The provision is not objectionable and the contradiction which the hon. Gentleman mentioned does not really exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another technical matter. The clause is especially important if a local authority has paid off all its debt. I have reports of two county councils, West Sussex and Dorset, that have no external debts, but Dorset's block borrowing approval for the financial year just ended amounted to £17 million and that of West Sussex to £12 million. In recent years, their borrowing approvals have been of a similar size and, no doubt, they will expect that to continue. They receive hefty borrowing approvals or, under the new system, credit approvals, but they have not borrowed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
That is perhaps an extreme example of why it is not contradictory to ask the council to set the borrowing limit in this way because in some authorities it is dramatically different from the credit approvals. Indeed, in many authorities—perhaps most—it is significantly different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to follow the Minister's logic. If local authorities are given borrowing approvals when they do not need them, surely there is something wrong with how the approvals are given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not quite right. It is easy for people to understand the figure for external borrowing. We have merely changed the wording to credit approval, because "borrowing" may be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credit approval will be necessary to apply to a project the money that an authority receives not from external borrowing but from internal borrowing, otherwise it would have to keep the money in the appropriate account. Credit approval is the means by which the total aggregate spending on capital projects is kept within bounds and shared equitably. A later provision in the Bill will make it possible to be more equitable and I am sure that hon. Gentlemen will have differing views on how to respond to that. They may not like the principle, but they may like some of the consequences that will arise from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to share the cake equitably. We are talking about money that is borrowed internally and the ability to finance spending from sales and receipts. The credit approval system is necessary. It wll be required if money is to be borrowed internally or if leasing arrangements are made. The figure will be different from that of the total borrowing requirement and I suggest that there is no contradiction.

The hon. Gentleman asked what will happen if an emergency decision is necessary. That occurs perfectly properly in many areas. Proposals for a variation may be put before the full council, just as the Government must sometimes put a supplementary estimate before Parliament. Most councils meet regularly and I do not anticipate any difficulty.

I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, if, during the Bill's later proceedings, he comes to me with an issue that he believes has not been properly covered, I shall be willing to clear up any difficulty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical and probing amendment. It seeks to make it clear that a local authority may contract out its register of loan commitments, in accordance with existing practice in many authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is necessary for authorities which maintain their registers on computer records and have perhaps contracted out the provision of computer facilities to either other local authorities or private firms. In this way, the maintenance of the register by the body providing the computer facilities will not allow a local authority strictly to comply with the terms of the clause in its present form in that it is not maintaining the register itself. The maintenance of a register is essential, particularly where there is a broad span of borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present provision imposes an unnecessary restriction. Moreover, it would be difficult for districts to operate their own registers for negotiable bonds. The amendment thus seeks to clarify the Government's position by seeking to retain the ability of local authorities to contract out the task of maintaining loan records. Subsection (1) appears to preclude the use of external registers, when the current practice in many authorities is to contract out all their registers of loan commitments. I shall be grateful if the Minister will clarify the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said, the clause requires a local authority to maintain a register of all the bonds, mortgages, stocks, bills and other documents against or by which money has been borrowed by the authority. However, it does not specify how the register is to be maintained, where it is to be held, or by whom it is to be kept up to date, although it is the local authority's responsibility to ensure that it is maintained. There is nothing in the clause to prevent an authority from using outside agents to keep its register; equally, there is nothing that would require it to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it had been intended to require the register to be maintained in-house, it would have been specified that the register should be kept by the proper officer of the authority. But there is no such requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore invite the hon. Member to withdraw amendment No.276.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 182—a trivial and technical amendment—is necessary because it is possible that a very few existing local authority

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 182 takes account of the possibility of some of the loan instruments being transferable by delivery, in which case the register does not need to show the details of the person to whom payments are made—that is the difference—whereas in others they need to have an authorisation by the person to whom the delivery is made.

	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. Section 144 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 defines charging authorities as district councils. Under the community charge regime, a charging authority must operate a collection fund into which it must pay the community charge, or poll tax, that is collected on behalf of county councils, parish councils and the local authority. Sums collected by way of national or non-domestic rates will be put into the fund. From the collection fund, sums due to other authorities must be distributed periodically, and the charging authority will be entitled only to the community
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
charge element collected on its behalf and to its proportion of needs grant. The amendment would ensure that funds collected on behalf of other authorities are not identified as revenues of the charging authority while held in the collection fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would further ensure that the authority has no recourse to other authorities' funds to meet its liabilities arising from borrowing. The inclusion of the amendment in the Bill would show clearly that funds to which a charging authority has recourse to secure borrowing would be revenues that were collected on its behalf, such as its proportion of needs grant, other Government grants, housing rents, general fees and charges. Those truly represent the revenues of a particular charging authority, so it is appropriate that the security offered by a charging authority against its borrowing is limited to the funds that are clearly identified as its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment should be welcomed because the idea and concept of a collection fund is new and there would be no doubt about the future ability to pay individual precepting authorities. If clause 38(1) remains unamended, it is conceivable that the whole of the collection fund could be lumped into the rest of the charging authorities' revenues for the purpose of determining security for money borrowed by those charging authorities. The amendment would clarify the position, which is entirely justifiable, as a substantial proportion of the collection fund will not technically be money that belongs to the charging authority. The Minister must clarify the issue and explain whether the revenues of the authority need to be defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 278. At present, provided that a company has appropriate powers in its articles of association, it can borrow on mortgage assets as it sees fit. A local authority-controlled or authority-influenced company will still be a separate legal entity and will not be part of the local authority of the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation and response papers on local authority interest in companies, the Government have shown that such companies will be unable to engage in activities in which the authorities themselves do not have the power to engage. It could be argued that clause 38(1) would require local authority companies to borrow only on the security of all the revenues of the company, thus restricting a company from indulging in straightforward mortgage transactions based on a single asset, such as a building. I believe that that should be avoided. The memorandum of association that is drawn up when new companies are formed will include powers for such companies to raise funds and use assets as they see fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite a couple of examples that are included in the Memorandum of Association of a company operating in the north-east. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) To purchase, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire any real or personal property or apparatus, equipment and other items and any rights of privileges and to construct, maintain and alter any buildings, erections or works necessary or convenient for the work of the company.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) Subject to such consents as may be necessary to sell, improve, manage, develop, let, mortgage, let out on hire or otherwise deal with all or any of the property or assets of the company as may be expedient."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
In order to raise funds to operate at arms' length from the local authority, a company must be able to offer security to borrow. It cannot guarantee revenues, as can a local authority. Therefore, its credit rating cannot be as high as that of a local authority. Without an asset base as security, a company would be unable to raise finance in the open market. The amendment would ensure that a local authority company was in the same position as a private company. The clause, as drafted, will put local authority companies at a distinct disadvantage. Will the Minister clarify the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said rightly that the collection fund is entirely new, and that it will be in place when the Bill comes into force on 1 April next year. The practice of a local authority collecting money from its ratepayers—as they are currently called—and handing it on to precepting authorities has been undertaken for a considerable time. I am sure that I carry the hon. Gentleman with me on that, given his experience of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Gentleman that subsection (1) of this highly boring clause—I am not speaking tongue in cheek—which amendment No. 277 seeks to amend, has been cribbed from existing legislation. It provides that if a local authority defaults on its borrowing, the lenders may look for their security to the revenues of the authority. As far as the Department of the Environment is aware, no local authority has so defaulted. That comes as a surprise to me as, occasionally in our proceedings, we cite instances when local authorities have behaved incorrectly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be persuaded to withdraw the amendment because no difficulties have arisen under the existing law in relation to security provisions. He will know that those provisions are undoubtedly appreciated by the lenders as they enable local authorities to obtain generally favourable terms. The security to which the hon. Gentleman referred would be much greater than would otherwise be the case. The amendment would reduce the security base on which money was being borrowed. Many local authorities, especially Labour-controlled authorities, prefer to leave the provisions as they stand with as wide a security base as possible. Therefore, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Gentleman's specific point about local authority companies, if assets are not surplus and are required in connection with the authority's functions, they should not be put at risk of foreclosure. Various deals by which authorities, such as Camden, have mortgaged their library books and parking meters may have caused some entertainment and done much to promote public understanding of the true nature of the authorities concerned, but they are the height of irresponsibility. If the security is pooled, ratepayers may have no books to read and no revenue from their parking meters, to say nothing about the consequences for traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
The hon. Member for City of Durham argued that an exception should be made for local authority companies, but precisely the same arguments apply. If a local authority has some surplus property and wishes to help a company, it should sell the property and use the usable part of the proceeds for that purpose. If the property were not surplus, it is not a good security for a loan for the reasons that I have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed local authority companies, and I do not wish to reiterate what I said earlier this week. I do not dispute that much local authority company activity—by no means all of it—is perfectly acceptable. But if the companies carry on their activities on the credit of the public sector and by using public-sector assets, their borrowing should be subject to the same limitations as the direct borrowings of local authorities. I do not know whether the hon. Member for the City of Durham is willing to withdraw amendment No. 278, but I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that there are no cases in which local authorities have defaulted in the past, but there has been no collection fund in the past. The possibility of default exists, although I hope that it will not occur. Nevertheless, I shall not press amendment No. 277 to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his colleagues always give examples of authorities in the south-east of England and, in particular, in London. He should look round the country and see that there are many Labour-controlled local authorities which have neither been in the courts nor surcharged, which run their authorities efficiently and which take account of their electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely. If the hon. Gentleman is making the point that there are more responsible local authorities in the north, I share his conviction. I am just as partial as he is, but they do not provide such enjoyable entertainment as some of the local authorities in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, I am not here to argue which authorities are entertaining and which are not. It is unfortunate that all local authorities are lumped together with those that are doing rather peculiar things in the south-east, especially those in London. The majority of local authorities are competent, well organised and efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority, on behalf of its electors, wishes for the sake of efficiency to raise capital for particular companies, I see no reason why it should not raise the capital that it needs through the process of mortgaging, as in the private sector. The Minister said that if there were surplus properties, they should be sold to raise capital. However, local authorities that have surplus accommodation may not want to sell it. They may have a use for it later. In education, for example, as a result of opting out, local financial management and maximum school rolls, authorities had surplus accommodation which they will now need because the law is being changed. Local authorities and local authority companies may not

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with credit arrangements—transactions where local authorities will receive benefits more than one financial year in advance of paying for them, such as leasing arrangements. I understand that credit approvals will authorise them and that they can be paid for from usable capital reserves or from revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 refers to cases where local authorities become lessees of land or goods which do not fall within the definition of credit arrangements. Under normal criteria, to enter into a lease for land or goods is a revenue transaction rather than a credit arrangement. This is a probing amendment that seeks an explanation from the Government why such leases are included under the heading of "credit arrangements".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 280 proposes that when an estimate is made of the value of the consideration to be given by an authority under a credit arrangement, the authority, not the Secretary of State, shall make the estimate. It is not clear who shall make the estimate of the value of the consideration under clause 39. We presume it shall be the authority but we need confirmation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 281 is to remove the power of the Secretary of State to prescribe that certain transactions are credit arrangements. Clause 39(1)(c) appears to restrict the freedom of local authorities to decide credit arrangements which they perceive to be in the best interests of their residents. The amendment would benefit democratically elected local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to a part of the Bill dealing with credit arrangements and the worry about definition is of obvious importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the difficulties of local government capital finance that have been described have their roots in
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
problems of definition. We have heard from hon. Members examples of behaviour that was either misguided or mischievous. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government gave, in his dulcet tones, many examples of local authority behaviour and I believe that the Committee agrees that it is essential to provide a proper definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of capital expenditure has been a prime preoccupation in recent years when considering local authority expenditure. On several occasions local authorities have made use of devices which have skirted round that definition or altered the time at which prescribed expenditure was scored. Finance leasing, deferred purchase deals, and medium-term property leasing are examples. The result, once such loopholes are exploited to a significant extent, is that the Government have to step in to amend the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that local authorities will argue that it is perfectly reasonable for them to optimise their position within any control system. But it is not in the interests of either local authorities or the Government to keep on playing the game of one side exploiting and the other side desperately trying to close chinks in the legislation which the House has passed. It is far better that we should provide a stable framework within which local authorities can devote their energies to proper financial management rather than dreaming up avoidance techniques. That is what we have tried to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new finance system controls borrowing, but the legal definition of borrowing is far from clear cut. Indeed, some transactions are clearly not borrowing in law but have the same economic effect. That is why we have introduced the concept of credit arrangements. Broadly, these are transactions which have the same economic effect as borrowing, but are not borrowing in law. Local authorities will be allowed to enter into credit arrangements, but only for capital purposes. They will need credit cover to do so, just as if they were borrowing. So there will be no incentive for local authorities to use credit arrangements rather than borrowing, unless it is financially more efficient to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of credit arrangement in clause 39 would be altered by the amendments. First, I will deal with amendments Nos. 279 and 281, which propose to remove two major planks of the definition, and then return to amendment No. 280.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 seeks to remove the first of the three types of credit arrangements, where there has been a lease on a property. In many leases the asset is specifically provided as new for the lessee. Often, it is intended that the lessee should have the benefit of the asset for most of its useful life. If a lease is taken in those circumstances and paid for over a number of years, there is scarcely any difference between leasing that asset and borrowing. In each case the authority gets the use of the asset and in each case it may pay a deposit or a premium, or it may not. It then makes payments to the lessor or the lender over a period equal to or less than the life of the asset. In one case the payments are called loan repayments, in the other rent or leasing payments, but there is scarcely any difference between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
A lease of that sort is called a finance lease, because it is a conventional way of financing the purchase of an asset. There is nothing wrong with it. It is perfectly respectable and is the same as borrowing for the purchase of the asset. If we control borrowing and do not control finance leases, the result would be obvious. Local authorities would obtain everything through finance leases, not because it was efficient, but because they would not have to use a credit approval to do so. Indeed, it would probably become less efficient, because leasing companies could be tempted to increase their charges, to take advantage of the incentive local authorities would have to lease assets rather than purchase them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the case for treating leases as credit arrangements is clear, but there are some exceptions, which I. shall spell out for the hon. Member for Torfaen because they are important. In general where a local authority takes a long lease of an asset, it is entering into a transaction similar to borrowing. That is why leasing has been included in prescribed expenditure under the present capital control system and, indeed, why it is treated as capital expenditure in public expenditure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to provide the exceptions through regulations under the clause. First, operating leases of equipment, plant, vehicles and the like will not be credit arrangements. Broadly, an operating lease, in contrast to a finance lease, is where the lessee does not take on the risks and benefits of owning the asset. The lease period will not be for the major part of the useful life of the asset and at the end of the lease the asset will revert to the lessor. We exempt operating leases from prescribed expenditure in the existing capital control system and I would expect the exemption in the new system to be similar to that used in the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other main exception will be short-term leases of land and buildings. By short term I mean less than three years, the same as in the present system. Hon. Members will be aware that the limit in the present system has been three years only since last March. Before that it was 20 years. The reason for the change is worth looking at briefly, it is a salutary example of the need to treat leasing in the same way as borrowing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's reply carefully. Why does she suggest a three-year period instead of the original 20 years? Why not a period of five or seven years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of judgment. Hon. Members will agree that the balance is right, because the 20-year limit applied from the start of the present system in 1981. It worked reasonably well at first, but a few years ago shorter leases started to proliferate. That is the crux of the problem. There was no new economic justification for such deals. There was no reason for suddenly taking out lease deals on parking meters or lease-leaseback deals on abattoirs or town halls. Other right hon. and hon. Members have, in gentle and conciliatory tones, explained why some of those arrangements were not in the best interests of their local residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why three years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained to the hon. Gentleman that we had to take a balanced view. We think that the three-year limit is right and proper to make the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complicated property deals with authorities entering into one-way options that everyone knew would be taken up are another example of the arrangements that gave such anxiety. Naturally, Sir Anthony, there was only one reason for many of those arrangements: they were simply and plainly to avoid capital controls. We want to ensure a level playing field between leasing and borrowing in the new system. We have no objection to leasing where it is appropriate, but we do not want to encourage people to undermine the controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fiddling the books.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said fiddling the books—a less than generous expression. It is understandable that local authorities should wish to maximise provisions for themselves. It is up to us to make it clear, through our definitions, what is proper and what is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lease of less than three years will not be a credit arrangement. A lease of more than 20 years will be a credit arrangement and will require credit to cover the full market value of the land. Leases between three and 20 years—those to which the hon. Gentleman perhaps refers—will also be credit arrangements, but the amount of credit cover required will be calculated on a sliding scale and will equal the full value of the land only for a lease of 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that leases between three and 20 years would involve specific arrangements. She then referred to land. Does the provision apply to land only?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangement refers not only to leases of land, but to those covering a much broader range. With that treatment of leases local authorities will be left free to choose between leasing and purchase on sensible financial grounds. Amendment No. 279 would prevent that. I recommend that the Committee rejects it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 281 would remove the regulation-making power to add to the definition of credit arrangements. That is a power that I very much hope we do not have to use, but it is one which experience has shown it would be unwise not to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 39 defines three types of credit arrangement. The first, leases, I have already discussed. The second includes broadly, any transaction in which a local authority receives benefits before paying for them. In many normal transactions, goods are paid for a short time after they are received, so the clause allows a year's lag, by comparing consideration still to be given at the end of a year with consideration still to be received at the start of that year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficult line to draw here. On the one hand, we wish to ensure that the definition of credit arrangements is sufficiently wide to cover all transactions which by their nature are similar to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
borrowing. On the other hand, we do not wish to catch in the definition what we might call normal transactions which span a number of years, but are not designed to undermine controls on borrowing. This is a complex area, but we believe that as a result of the narrower definition, we shall make progress and that a regulation-making power is prudent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the matters covered by amendment No. 280 may have been less than clear. We shall accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment which concerns the test of whether a contract, by itself or with others, falls within the definition of a credit arrangement. The test is based on estimates of the consideration to be given and received under the contract. The amendment proposes that the estimate should be made by the authority. I am advised that that would be the case with, or without, the amendment, but in view of the lack of clarity we shall accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was particularly interested in the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Minister on amendment No. 279. She referred briefly to the reasons why the previous controls on 20-year leases have been extended to all leases to a limit of three years. She said, rightly, that the previous arrangements led to some abuse by local authorities which got round capital controls by entering into leasing arrangements with third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend satisfied that the present limit of three years is adequate, in view of certain arrangements being entered into by local authorities? I refer specifically to the London borough of Ealing. The activities of that council over a housing association led in part to the original statement that the limit would be three years for leases excluded from capital controls. The London borough of Ealing can now use the three-year arrangement to get round capital controls on housing. It does so by using housing associations. The present arrangements in Ealing are outside capital controls: a housing association can buy any property that it wishes on the open market, without reference to the district valuer. The housing association borrows money from a buiding society, but tells the building society that it proposes to dispose of the building within three years. The local authority says to the housing association that it will guarantee any loss on the sale of the building within three years, should there be a loss, and guarantees any revenue deficit on the building in the meantime. As a result, the guarantee by the local authority to the housing association, or the building society, does not score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very substantial sum of money has been earmarked for this purpose in Ealing and fairly expensive properties are being acquired on the open market by housing associations with 100 per cent. nomination to the local authority, and that is totally outside any capital control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend will tell me whether there is any other reason for those arrangements except to get round capital controls?
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
The only reason why the Government have had to be restrictive on local government about that is because of its attempts to get round reasonable rules. We do not want to be unfair to the London borough of Ealing, so can my hon. Friend tell me if there is another reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason for this unusual arrangement is to get round capital controls. I can think of no other housing association, when it buys a building, which says that it will sell it within three years. The purpose is to get round the three-year control on capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, properties are being acquired in Ealing by housing associations and effectively underwritten by public guarantee, because the building society would not lend money without that guarantee. That is driving a coach and horses through capital controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister asked whether there was another reason. Has it been considered that if a local authority has a 100 per cent. nomination right and the money is supplied to charitable housing associations, all attempts to have the right to buy will fail? Therefore, this is a way round the right to buy as well as round capital controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the case. The London borough of Ealing does not have a good record on processing applications for the right to buy. My hon. Friend is right to say that properties acquired under this process carry with them no right to buy, which would be the case if the local authority obtained the money through HIP allocations in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further ruse of which my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends should be aware. At the end of those three years it is possible for another local authority to guarantee the arrangement for a further three years—perhaps Brent or Hillingdon. In effect, a property could remain in the ownership of the housing association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly perturbed by the hon. Gentleman's use of the word "ruse". He may also like to consider the total cost of this exercise against the cost of putting people into bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Perhaps the council's main aim is to provide decent accommodation for people at prices they can afford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to broaden the debate by instancing the large number of empty properties in the London borough of Ealing or the number of properties squatted, that should be used for people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the London borough of Ealing can offer existing council tenants money to move out to cheaper parts of the country—many of them want to—to free accommodation for the homeless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be diverted into a general debate on Ealing and housing. I want to focus on my hon. Friend's remark. I suspect that if I give way to the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) he will do just that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can well understand why the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) does not want to be diverted. Will he give a clear statement about whether he is opposed to the provision of affordable housing for rent in his area, knowing that those discount schemes are not adequate for people who seek to stay in the area and rent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of providing more housing to rent in the London borough of Ealing. The Housing Act 1988 offers such an opportunity for the private sector to invest. Coupled with the business expansion scheme provisions in the Finance Act 1988, there is now an opportunity for the private sector to do what previously could be done only by the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I wish to leave with my hon. Friend the Minister, on which she may wish to reflect, is whether she is satisfied that the present capital controls and those envisaged in the Bill will cope with the ruse—I use the word "ruse" purposefully—by the London borough of Ealing to get round capital controls by using housing associations as agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend might like to reconsider his use of the word "ruse". Is it not too polite a term? It means that one local authority is stealing from other local authorities the opportunity to provide the capital expenditure that they need? Yet, when they keep within the law, they find that their allocations are cut because of someone else's overspending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his characteristic forthrightness, my right hon. Friend has been far more explicit than I, as a man of moderation, would ever dare to be. The theme that has run through the debate is the excesses of a few local authorities that have obliged the Government to act in a way that has hit all of them. That matter was referred to when we discussed Widdicombe in part I of the Bill and we are discussing that again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who represents a local authority that uses any legal means possible to get round capital controls and then obliges ratepayers to pick up the tab many years later, I do not believe that the provisions go far enough. I want reassurance for my ratepayers who are guaranteeing the arrangements that they will not be saddled with huge debts in future years simply because the Government have not spotted that way round capital controls in time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) is an acute observer of local government matters, and, once again, he has raised an important issue. He described another example of the way in which people use their energies not to provide services for their local ratepayers, but to dream up mechanisms for undermining the controls that are in place. My hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
Friend has frequently cited examples of the way in which his local authority has ill-used local ratepayers. I understand that this year, they will face a rate increase of over 30 per cent. My hon. Friend has drawn attention to the way in which the refuse in that area is poorly collected. It was not collected for 10 days over the Christmas period—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend says that it was three weeks. He has a close awareness and knowledge of matters in Ealing and every other local authority in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Bill sets a framework so that local goverment can retain the reputation and respect which it rightly deserves. The examples to which my hon. friend the Member for Ealing, Acton referred, discredit good local government practice and those committed individuals who work in local government for the ratepayers, soon to be community charge payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware of the problem in Ealing and Acton. My right hon. Friend and others are giving considerable attention to it, as a matter of urgency. I ask my hon. Friend to be patient. I am unable to offer a solution today, but the provision on credit arrangements will be a significant improvement. Later in the Bill, we may be able to discuss that housing matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the extension of the definition. I am sure that local authorities will be grateful, too, that the operation of short-term leases on land will be covered by the definition. I believe that the arrangements are far too rigid. I see nothing wrong with local authorities maximising their capital. It pales into insignificance compared with private industry which can finance its operations and optimise benefits for its shareholders. I cannot see the difference between that and maximising opportunities for ratepayers—or chargepayers, as they are to be called—in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 281, the Under-Secretary of State said that she did not think that the Secretary of State would find it necessary to use his powers. This theme runs throughout the Bill and I find it unacceptable. I do not think that a Bill should contain powers which Ministers do not propose to use. This again reflects badly on the very many local authorities which are doing a good job.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, Sir Anthony, that, like me, you have read the clause in great detail and have seen the formula that it contains. When I glanced at the Bill initially, I thought, "I am bound not to have to speak on clause 40." but here I am. I do not know which Minister will answer the debate, but I hope that he or she is well versed in algebra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 40 relates to the calculation of initial and subsequent costs of credit arrangements. On reading it, I discovered to my surprise that "r" became very important. It referred to the appropriate rate of discount. Amendment No. 282 would allow the local authority, rather than the Secretary of State, to determine the appropriate rate. As the Bill is drafted, no limit is placed on the Secretary of State's discretion over what the discount rate for credit arrangements should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried because Secretaries of State cannot possibly know the individual circumstances of local authorities. We feel that it would be better to allow local authorities to determine discount rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister will say that that would be inappropriate because some local authorities would respond irresponsibly to such an opportunity. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) in a distinguished debate, said that the Bill's proposals are based on what one or two authorities might do, or may have done in the past. A body of legislation appears to have been built on that premise. We do not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that local authorities will take investment decisions seriously they are bound by the same considerations of reasonableness as are business or the Government. I also believe that, in practice, because of the amount of time that the Government have had to spend on other matters, "r" will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
buried among a host of other regulations arising from the Bill and that insufficient parliamentary time will be allocated to debate them. It would be far better if each authority decided on "r" on the basis of its departments' knowledge and expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 283 would require the Secretary of State to prescribe the discount rate for each financial year before 1 January of the previous financial year. There is a Government amendment which deals with such matters—no doubt the Minister will refer to it—but from my 10 years' experience in local government I know that local authorities need to plan their capital programmes some time before the commencement of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good Governments, the Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment telling local authorities precisely what a capital allocation—or, as it will now be, a borrowing allocation—is only weeks before a capital programme is due to start. Amendment No. 283 would make life much easier for local authorities. Often, Government Departments tell local authorities off for not spending their money. They send circulars saying, "We've given the council all this money and it hasn't spent it in time. Why not?" Often that is the direct fault of the Government, and the amendment would overcome the problem and the uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 284, the percentage rate of discount—"r"—shall be determined having regard to market rates of interest and local authorities' time preference rates. That would be the case only if the value of "r" reflected the current cost of borrowing. The Bill gives no guidance about what Secretaries of State should take into account when deciding the figure. It seems to me that it must relate to market rates of interest and to local authorities' preference rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would make the clause much more acceptable to local government, and I hope that the Minister will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) put his arguments with his customary care and clarity. I agree that that provision, which we are told will make the clause easier to operate, looks forbidding. In fact, it is a sensible way of presenting our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 282, he was elegant enough to prejudge my possible response to the idea that the discount rate should be fixed by local authorities. Even if the activities of a number of major local authorities in recent years did not make us doubt the propriety of their use of capital spending and of the opportunities afforded to them in the past, it would be odd to give the right to determine the discount to the people who would benefit most the larger it became. Even the most moderate and reasonable councils would be tempted if they could decide how much the discount could score against their figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even without the salutory lessons cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and others, I would resist the proposal. Even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
good authorities with a reputation for prudence, such as Salford, would be tempted. We are dealing not only with Salford, however, but with Manchester; not only with Barking and Dagenham, but with Brent. The hon. Gentleman will notice that, with care and eloquence, I have referred not to councils under the control of different political parties but to authorities under the same political control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why I do not believe that the discount rate should be in the hands of local authorities. First, it would, in effect, destroy the control. Secondly, many authorities have tried to get round the regulations rather than work with them. That is why we cannot accept amendment No. 282.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to amendment No. 283, the hon. Member for Torfaen has a valid point. I agree with him that it is important for local government to be able to plan properly—my response to other amendments has shown my view—although we sometimes disagree about how best to achieve our shared aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty about accepting amendment No. 283 is that there are many circumstances in which to do so would be to the disadvantage of a local authority. For example, let us suppose that the interest rates are low on 1 January and rise towards the beginning of the coming financial year. In the case of the discount rate, however complex the schedules, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the higher the interest rate that is taken into account, the better the deal will be for the local authority. That is the opposite of what one would expect. Therefore, it might be to the disadvantage of a local authority if the discount rate were fixed on 1 January or before if, in the meantime, interest rates were to rise. The local authority would complain in mid-February that it was entirely unfair that the discount rate was fixed at one level and now it will be penalised because of the effect of rising interest rates. However efficient the Government, the rise of interest rates is a fact of life, as it has been under different Governments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government make them rise faster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the hon. Gentleman the opportunity to make a sedentary intervention as things have been rather quiet for the past five minutes and I did not want him to go to sleep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the hon. Member for Torfaen that the proposal is too sharp a sword. However, the Secretary of State will, in all circumstances, try to give information as early as possible and we shall continue discussions with local authorities. We should not however, be bound in the way suggested because it would damage local authorities. It is not helpful to have early warning of the discount rate but not of the interest rate, because the two are related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to respond to amendment No. 284. I know my answer to be true, but having sat on the Back Benches and proposed similar amendments to other Bills, I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman. I hope that he will accept that I have to take legal advice but, even so, find it unsatisfactory because I know what the hon. Gentleman wants to do. However, I am told that the amendment will not do
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
what he wants, which is to say, "Look, the discount rate is closely associated with the interest rates that the local authority has to pay. Therefore that should be underlined in the Bill by accepting the amendment."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the discount rate could not be fixed without primarily taking into account interest rates. Other factors must also be considered, not least what interest rates affect a local authority given its circumstances. It would not help to include such a provision in the Bill because it would not make the Secretary of State do something that he would otherwise not do. He is automatically bound to do this, otherwise the discount rate could not be fixed. However, such a provision would not allow him to take into account those other factors which a local authority might wish him to consider. It would demote any other consideration which may be extremely important to the local authority. As I see it, local authorities would want to put before the Secretary of State all the factors that he might wish to take into account; they should not be closed off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the hon. Member for Torfaen that I cannot imagine circumstances when the purport of his proposal would not be true—the discount rate is primarily about that. I have been utterly truthful and frank about my reaction to the amendment. It would not be a helpful legal addition to the Bill. In any event, it would not do what the hon. Gentleman wants. What he wants is clearly in the proposals. Therefore, the amendment should not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake, however, that if there is another way of ensuring that it is said—if it is necessary to say it—I shall look for that, but I do not wish to argue about what is not really a difference between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the Minister about the forbidding nature of the clause. It is so forbidding that, at the end of his remarks, I thought that he might ask me to table another amendment, off the top of my head, to replace amendment No. 284. That would take some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No 282, we must differ about the local authority, or the Secretary of State having to agree on the rate of discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 283 refers to the date. At present, local authorities take into account the interest rates before January in each year, when they set both their revenue and capital budgets. I do not see much difference, but something useful might emerge from a further meeting between the Minister's Department and the local authority associations on this matter and, indeed, on the proposal in amendment No. 284. There is much in common. However, on the basis of there being further discussions with the local authority associations, perhaps at officer level, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Save where the Secretary of State expressly permits".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is of interest to small local authorities, especially members of the Association of District Councils, that may encounter difficulties financing a large project of special value to their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give the Secretary of State discretion to permit a credit arrangement when, at the time the arrangement comes into being, there is not available to an authority an amount of credit cover equal to the initial cost of the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some facility is required to enable the occasional large project to proceed. That is especially important for the smaller local authorities that do not have large basic credit approvals or large spending power from useable capital receipts. Unless they have access to basic credit approvals, the cost of such a project would be added to the poll tax or community charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is provision for exemption, as the amendment proposes, many of the schemes that might get caught are ones which the Government support—for example, those involving partnership arrangements with the private sector. The local authorities that I mentioned would like the Government to say how they envisage their proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present regime, it is possible to carry forward unused spending power, but the Bill wipes that out. Under a previous arrangement, Government approval was required for each project. I am sure that no one wants to return to that regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exemption such as that proposed in the amendment would allow discretion for the Secretary of State, so there would not be abuse by local authorities such as those we have in mind. The amendment provides leeway for the Secretary of State to grant an authority limited ability to enter a credit arrangement in anticipation of future receipts or revenue contributions along the lines of existing exemption for deferred purchase schemes. I hope that my hon. Friend will smile sweetly on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I support my hon. Friend. I was previously involved with a local authority with 12,000 electors. It had to embark on a new sewerage system, the expenditure for which—approximately £1 million—was huge in comparison with its normal annual capital expenditure of approximately £100,000 for all projects. Many small authorities no longer exist following reorganisation of local government, but some authorities in England and Wales are of that size. For example, in Teesdale, the smallest district council has only 20,000 electors. It would be a major burden for that council if the whole cost of a capital project, such as a leisure centre, fell on the community charge payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
The matter is serious and I support my hon. Friend in asking for clarification and guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have followed the matter carefully. The issue raised by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) causes anxiety and the Minister should consider the amendment. It is in the interests of smaller local authorities. We have seen the problems that arose when the Secretary of State imposed on local authorities last March sudden decisions on capital arrangements. A few weeks later, he had to return to the Dispatch Box and change the arrangement because of their impact on smaller authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision must be made in the clause to help local authorities. The amendment would give the Secretary of State authority to consider schemes submitted to him. I hope that Tory Members will support the amendment and that the Minister will accept it. There are problems with some of the major projects that local authorities must tackle concerning deferred purchase and partnership arrangements. Opposition Members believe that the amendment is constructive and we appeal for support for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand perfectly the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and for Hertfordshire, West (Mr. Jones), and the comments of the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). My only disagreement concerns the mechanism for dealing with the matter. I understand what my hon. Friend wishes to do, but I assure him that the matter can be dealt with under the present system. The changes will make possible what has not always been possible in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends know that, before the Bill, there was inflexibility in the provision of borowing approval. One of the great difficulties was that we had to give extra opportunity to borrow to authorities that may not have had the same needs as others. We had to make provision across the board, in a way that was extremely inflexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system is more flexible. In the circumstances to which my hon. Friends refer, the answer is for extra credit approvals to be given by the Secretary of State to the authority in question. That can be done and the Secretary of State would expressly permit it. I can imagine no circumstances in which the amendment would enable the Secretary of State to do something that he could not do under the present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know what happens. A total amount of credit approvals is available. To go beyond that, by giving express permission or by giving extra credit approvals, would be a matter for the Secretary of State to discuss with the Treasury and the other parties involved. Extra credit approvals would be given, with or without the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton to withdraw the amendment on my assurance that what he seeks could and would be done under the present system. The Secretary of State could not expressly permit extra credit, without in effect providing credit approval. There are technical

reasons why the amendment would not work, but I accept and understand my hon. Friend's argument. I believe that the present system will allow their objectives to be achieved, given that the Secretary of State approved. I hope that, with that assurance, he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to an earlier debate, my right hon. Friend the Minister said that it was important for local authorities to plan ahead. No one would dissent from that. The Bill enables the Secretary of State to issue credit approvals up to 31 March, before the financial year begins on 1 April. It would be difficult to plan against that background. Capital budgeting requires careful forward planning and local authorities must know well in advance of 31 March what resources will be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government budgeting for the financial year beginning on 1 April is usually completed by the end of November, which is when the public expenditure survey committee round normally draws to a close. At present, the RSG supplement figure is usually announced in December and confirmed in January. Local authorities are anxious that their basic credit approvals are notified to them at least by 31 December, which would be the impact of my amendment. The Opposition's amendment is even more ambitious and suggests the earlier date of 30 November. I shall not quibble too much if my right hon. Friend accepts the earlier date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important not to let the Bill go through at present as it allows the Secretary of State to issue basic credit approvals on 30 March. No one could plan ahead sensibly on that basis. I hope that my right hon. Friend can accept the amendment or assure me—as he did so ably a few moments ago—that my anxiety is needless, that another part of the Bill provides the assurance that I seek and that the amendment is not required. I hope that he can allay my anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is extremely important and our amendments are designed to mitigate some ot its effects on local authorities. I have considerable sympathy with the opening comments of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) about the importance of local authorities being able to plan ahead. It is clear from the drafting of the clause that the Government still tend not to regard that aspect as important. They pay lip service to the idea, but continue to make local authority planning difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that our amendment is similar to his, except that it would give local authorities four months' notice, instead of three. It would allow a local authority to have an idea before the Christmas period of what resources
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
it would receive. Even with the hon. Gentleman's amendment, local authorities would be asked to make decisions on the basis of information that could be given to them as late as the beginning of the new year. It would be better if the authorities received it a month before Christmas when many of them could work out their financial requirements for the following year. Will the Government consider that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister would not ask a private company to operate on that basis. As part of its normal procedure, it could not be expected to operate its business if it were told the day before the beginning of the new financial year how much it could borrow. A local authority should be given sufficient time to work out its financial requirements for the following 12 months. The more time that is allocated to planning, the more effective such planning would be. That is the aim of our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
The proposed systems of captial expenditure controls focus on the control of expenditure financed by borrowing and the control of credit arrangements. The Government seek to achieve their aim through annual credit approvals that allow local authorities to borrow or enter into credit arrangements up to the level of the approval granted by the Secretary of State. We object to the tight timescale in the Bill. It must be borne in mind that local authorities are required to issue their precepts by 1 March. That process must take into account the revenue implications of the capital programme, the levels of which are dependent, in part, on the credit approvals given by the Secretary of State. I think that the Minister is aware of that important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
