<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 17, in page 2, line 39, leave out from 'such' to end of line 41 and insert 'guidance in relation to his political activities as may be equivalent to any guidance contained from time to time within any code of practice applicable to civil servants'.</p>
<p>No. 18, in page 2, line 39, leave out from 'requirements' to end of line 41 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'as disqualify him from being a member of a local authority'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 19, in page 2, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(5A) In exercising his power to make regulations under subsection (5) above, the Secretary of State shall have regard to any guidance contained in any Code of Practice applicable to civil servants, and to the desirability of incorporating similar provisions within the regulations.'</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 20, in page 2, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(5A) No regulations shall be made under subsection (5) above unless the Secretary of State has consulted with the local authority associations and such other organisations as appear to him to be concerned.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had, I thought, come to the end of what I had to say about amendment No. 16.<br><br>
The problem with amendment No. 17 is that it incorporates into terms of appointments and conditions of employment of holders of politically restricted posts such guidance, in relation to their political activity, as may be equivalent to any guidance contained within any code of practice applicable to the contracts of service appplicable to all Civil Servants.<br><br>
There are two problems about that. It was suggested by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that the Opposition should know what the restrictions were based upon. Regulations that affect local government service already operate on the basis of statute. Local authorities have to look up section 80(1) <i>(a)</i> of the Local Government Act 1972 if they want to find out what disqualifications apply to employees in any post to which the local authority appoints or confirms an appointment. Those arrangements are clear and we are following the same procedure in the Bill. There is nothing new here.<br><br>
It is difficult to believe that the amendment would be suitable on that ground, but I shall go on to the second ground. I do not think that the hon. Member for Normanton would want to achieve the results his proposals would bring about. If I were to remind hon. Members briefly of the rules limiting the political activity of officers in the Civil Service they would see the comparison brought by the amendment into the present legislation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
Civil Servants are "politically free", "intermediate" or "politically restricted" according to grade. Staff in the first group may engage in political activity. Those in the second may participate in politics only with the permission of the Department. Those in the third group may participate in local political activity with the permission of their Department, but may in no circumstances participate in national political activity.<br><br>
Those rules are derived from the Civil Service pay and conditions of service code. The paragraphs in question are 9923 to 9957, and Departments such as my own will have incorporated those provisions from the code into the Departmental staff rules.<br><br>
The provisions in the Civil Service code are not guidance. The paragraphs apply to all civil servants covered by the code. They convey to the politically free group permission to undertake political activities, place requirements on other civil servants and set down procedures to deal with the certain other cases. In other words, they are not guidance but lay down the law.<br><br>
If we take those provisions into account, we will lay upon local government officers a number of requirements that I am sure Opposition Members would not want. We would not have the exception from what is laid upon the shoulders of senior civil servants concerning the right of local government officers in the appropriate tone and form to write about subjects of local government professional interest. Senior civil servants are unable to do that, and if we included the code in that sense it would also exclude local government officers.<br><br>
We can allow national civil servants to take part in local government in certain circumstances, but not in national government. We are talking about local government officers and it would be odd to restrict their activities in elected posts by including such terms of reference in the Bill. I do not believe that that is what Opposition Members intend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The code for civil servants is not the same as that suggested in the Bill. If it stopped at principal officer grade, there would be some similarity but the Bill refers to much lower grades. It might even encompass manual workers who earn above £13,500. The Minister is not comparing like with like. There is an unknown, grey area in the Bill's application which the amendment seeks to remove. If the amendment is accepted, people earning above £13,500 but below principal officer grade will have a contract stating their conditions of employment. I ask the Minister to compare like with like.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks two different and opposite things. On one hand, the hon. Gentleman is trying to introduce a proposal that is akin to the Civil Service rules and on the other he says that the Civil Service rules are not the same because they relate, in his view, to a wider range of people. The amendment would be inappropriate in either case because we lay a lighter burden on local government officers than on civil servants and because, as the hon. Gentleman said, local government and the Civil Service are different.<br><br>
I will be happy to consider later amendments, but it is odd to argue that we should put into the Bill rules that are akin to those which govern civil servants. We take it for granted that civil servants in general should not engage in political activities and we are applying a similar rule to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0461">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
local authority officers. However, it would be odd to jump to the opposite view and include in the Bill exactly what applies to civil servants. That is not what the Bill is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confusion can be illustrated by the case of Councillor Hollingwood who served on Greenwich council when he was a Civil Service executive officer. However, he has now been appointed as an estates officer in the borough of Southwark and will be disqualified under the Bill's contractual arrangements for employment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said, that is nonsense. In one breath, the Minister is using civil servants as an example of those who should not be involved and with the next disqualifying those who, had they stayed in the Civil Service, would have been able to take part in local politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises two issues. First, we do not know what is the councillor's new job and whether it will mean that he is excluded from elected membership of a local authority. Secondly, we are concerned precisely with the fact that it is inappropriate for a member of a political party to be elected to a council and also to work for a council as an independent adviser. We are not discussing other, comparable activities.<br><br>
Opposition Members may want to extend their proposal or to table another amendment and that would be reasonable, but we are talking about an amendment which seeks to incorporate into the legislationn the rules that apply to civil servants. We cannot do that for two reasons: first, because they would bear more onerously in certain areas than what we are suggesting; secondly, they would be nonsensical in circumstances where the people they would exclude would be those involved in local government—and the Bill is about local government. So for those reasons the amendment is not a sensible proposal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 18 has two effects. First, it proposes to delete the power for the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations requirements for restricting the political activity of holders of politically restricted posts. Secondly, it proposes the incorporation in the terms of employment of every person holding a politically restricted post a requirement disqualifying him or her, as the case may be, from being a member of a local authority.<br><br>
It is a perfectly reasonable proposal. I see the argument, but there are two sides to it, and as I see it, the most appropriate way to deal with the problem is to lay down regulations. The Secretary of State has said what the regulations will do in principle; and they will follow the Widdicombe proposals that I mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I should like to complete this part of my speech, and then I shall be happy to give way. Those proposals are—I repeat—the standing for and holding of public elected office, the holding of office in a political party, the speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party-political debate, and cavassing at elections.<br><br>
I want to finish this part of my speech because I want to deal with some of the worries that exist. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
Commission for Racial Equality need have no worries. It is perfectly proper for someone to take an active part in that organisation and its local branches, and I see no difficulty.<br><br>
Some people worry that there may be problems for people on the board of school governors. I assure the Committee that a person can play a full part in a local board of governors, and vote and speak in the way he wishes. Whether he feels that it is appropriate or inappropriate for a school to opt out, he can say so and act as governors generally act, but it would be be clearly inappropriate, and would be seen as inappropriate, if the director of social services of a local authority sitting on a school governing body took to the streets with large posters and notices saying that the wicked Tory policy or the nasty Labour council's policy was wholly to be deplored. That would be taking a political view and an active part in politics, and there is a clear distinction between the two activities.<br><br>
Worries were expressed about voluntary organisations and charities. I believe that Shelter mentioned, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) will agree, its very nature as a charity precludes it from party-political campaigning. He is a distinguished member of that organisation, and it has other members who are distinguished members of Opposition parties, both the Social and Liberal Democrats and the Labour party. So there is no difficulty about that. If a local organisation were to stage a sit-in and campaign with posters against a political party and side with another political party, that would be contrary to the charitable status of the organisation, and it would be inappropriate for a local government officer to take part in it. However, I think that the distinction is fairly clear and should not cause any real difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, but I want to comment on the problems that were raised by the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant). I am conscious of the need to reassure people about the appropriateness of local officials involved in activities of a community nature. I repeat that that would be entirely proper in organisations involved in the advancement and understanding of equal opportunities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton mentioned parish councils. It is perfectly proper for local officials to be members of those councils. That is why they are excluded from reference in the Bill. But there is a difficulty and I accept what the hon. Gentleman said. Perhaps the notes on clauses could have said, for example, that the provision "does not apply to the following", but that following list could be almost endless. I assumed that people would understand that if parish councillors were not mentioned that was because they did not come under the arrangement. The reasons for that are very much those which the hon. Gentleman put forward. Most parish councils are non party political and make decisions about the local community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I promised to give way first to the hon. Member for Torfaen.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0462">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, when the Minister refers to the Secretary of State, does that also include the Secretaries of State for Wales and for Scotland? Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) asked about parish councils. I accept that those councils are excluded from the measure, but if parish councillors take on a political label, as more are now doing, surely they will be excluded in any event?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As to the hon. Gentleman's first point, I apologise for not answering his specific question. Yes, it is the appropriate Secretary of State. I do not envisage a distinction between the decisions made by the Secretaries of State. However, if the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends from Scottish constituencies felt that there were specific differences which they wished to impress on my right hon. Friends, no doubt they would do so. Under the legislation, my right hon. Friends would make decisions as appropriate. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales will no doubt take on board any such matter which the hon. Gentleman may raise in this debate and I shall pass on to my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland any other point that arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already promised to give way, but I shall come back to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen is right that parish councillors would not be excluded because of their membership of a parish council. But if, for instance, they canvassed on behalf of a political party, they would be excluded because that would be an inappropriate activity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that it would be entirely proper for local government officers to play a full part on a school board, for example, or in a housing charity such as Shelter, provided that he or she did not engage in political activity directed against a specific political party.<br><br>
However, what would happen if a ruling administration, perhaps a Conservative one, decided to close a school? Would local government officers with children at that school be entitled to attend and speak at public meetings to oppose that decision or would such action be regarded as party political activity from which they are debarred?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a role for good sense. In normal circumstances, there is no reason why a local government officer could not carry out the usual activities of a school governor. I used an extreme example of when the normal boundaries might be transgressed. Good sense shows that someone could be a fully active school governor and also participate if there were an argument about whether a school should be closed. The hon. Gentleman would probably agree with me because of the example that he cited.<br><br>
It is possible to be on different sides of this argument in the same political party. I am a Conservative Member of Parliament and a member of the Government. Recently I took an active part in fighting for the retention of two schools in my constituency, against the views of the Conservative-controlled county council. I am pleased to say that both schools have been saved. But there are proprieties on how to argue and I hope that I met the rules of propriety. There was no doubt about where I stood on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
the matter and the action to be taken. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, and then to my hon. Friend before returning to my original point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On 23 February, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore decided that the real distinction should be between elected and non-elected. That, I believe, has been widely believed to be the right distinction in the past."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 23 February, 1989; c. 22.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) that if a person is elected to a parish council while still twin-tracking and is not writing political literature, that would be acceptable, but the same position would not be accepted in a district council. An independent, an officer of an urban authority, who is not involved in the writing of literature has to be elected, and the Minister says that election is the criterion. There is a conflict of views, the position becomes more woolly and the Bill has been proved to be stupid in its presentation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen asked who would be the adjudicating officer for a political elected member of a parish council who might come within the terms of the Bill. Would the officer be in the parish council, the county council or the Department of the Environment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman ought to be too concerned about that situation, which has pertained for years for civil servants in restricted categories. They have usually been allowed to stand for positions on parish councils, but not if they were party political candidates. As I understand it, no attack has been made on the practice at any time by the Opposition. It has always been accepted as perfectly reasonable, and we are continuing it.<br><br>
The facts are that the overwhelming majority of parish councils, by the nature of what they discuss and the concerns that are theirs, do not discuss issues in a party political way. They cannot be said in any real sense to be in conflict. They discuss much more parochial matters, such as whether there should be street lighting or whether a light should be moved. It is difficult for even the most ardent politican to find a party political reason why, in the village of Winston, where I live, there should be street lighting. The general experience of the Civil Service is that that is the best way to proceed. There have been no problems with it.<br><br>
Appeals are a different matter. An appeal is about whether a person's job with a district or county council is carried out properly and is compatible with taking an active part in politics. It is not about someone being a member of a parish council. If a local councillor whose salary was above the limit was excluded from party political activities and he felt that his job in, say, the computer office of a local authority was clearly compatible with taking part in party political activities outside, he would appeal to the adjudicating officer on the question of whether he could participate in such activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a little list. I shall come to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
If the adjudicator said yes, the person could stand as a party political figure in a parish council, just as he could on any other council. Therefore the issue does not arise.<br><br>
I shall give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and then to the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor):</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0463">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend knows that in Wales we refer to parish councils as community councils. In my constituency there have been no problems whether people stand on a political ticket or as independents. However, community councils have a growing interest in planning matters and there might be problems if a member of a community council was a planning officer for the district or county council. There may be a clash of interests in his role as a community councillor and his professional role as a local authority official. Such matters might be dealt with under a code of conduct. People would not be prohibited from being community or parish councillors if they were members of principal authorities, but they might be enjoined under a code of conduct not to take part in parish or community council work that impinged on their professional work in, for example, the planning department of the principal local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such a situation might arise, but I have no evidence of it having occurred. In such circumstances, it would be rare for an officer not to be able to take a decision according to his professional code; such decisions are at least partly covered by the conflict of interest guidelines. However, I take note of what my hon. Friend has said. I shall consider whether it is suitable for inclusion in the code of conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take further the example of parish councils. In general, they do not discuss issues in a party political or extreme way, but they let their Members of Parliament know their views on matters of national political concern—for example, water privatisation. Parish councils tell me how that legislation will affect their parishes. In some cases they are opposed to it. They also inform me of their views on access to information and the poll tax.<br><br>
The Minister gave an extreme example of school governors in the board room quietly discussing whether to opt out but also marching in the streets. We all know what the Minister means, but it would be more complicated if the school organised a meeting for parents to discuss opting out and the governors gave their views on the issue from the platform. In those circumstances, there is a grey area. How would they know whether they risked being pulled up? The Minister made it clear that the appeal system relates to individuals and to the general acceptability of political campaigning rather than to particular examples. What would those governors do if they were pulled up?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A habit is growing in the Committee of making speeches in the form of interventions. Interventions must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that, depending on the personalities of parish councillors, they comment suitably on a range of issues. Many do so, taking as their standpoint the way in which a proposal may affect the parish. The hon. Gentleman gave perfectly reasonable examples. I do not see why, in those circumstances, a local government officer could not join his parish council in making its point. It would be more parochial than political. Many people take a general political view about a subject but a rather different view if it affects them directly. NIMBY is not a narrow concept. I fear that it affects many issues.<br><br>

I agree with the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that it is not easy to draw the line. I give him a comparison. As a Minister in the Department of the Environment, there are clear rules about what I must not do to avoid prejudicing planning appeals in my constituency.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
I know that I must not do either what is clearly inappropriate or that which would throw into doubt the independence of any decision, even when I shall have no part in taking it.<br><br>
I have to decide for myself on a number of in-between matters where I am open to challenge. I have to think, "How do I answer that letter?" It is not a question of asking the Department because it does not happen like that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, would agree. People ask me questions on the doorstep or in my surgery and I have to decide how to answer. That is not unreasonable and I do not see that there will be a problem.<br><br>
I know of no case in all the years during which civil servants have had to behave in this way where they have found a difficulty. I do not think that the problem will arise in real life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What will happen to a school governor who feels it within his bounds to make such a speech if someone in the audience, or another council officer, complains? There appears to be no appeal in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be for the employing authority to initiate action. As with the civil servant, it is extremely unlikely that an authority would do so in such a marginal case. I can proceed only by the facts of history. I know of no case of a civil servant being embarrassed in this way. My case is more difficult because if I get a decision wrong it might be used in a court case to demonstrate the impropriety of a later decision. I am open to action by an employing authority and by a range of other people. The question raised by the hon. Member for Truro will not cause a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether council officials who seek clarification on whether their contracts exclude them from standing for elected office are by that very act falling into the Minister's trap and identifying their clear party-political stand?<br><br>
I am in favour of appeal if the Bill is enacted. However, will the fact that officers identify their politics openly by appealing ensure that they are caught if their appeals are turned down? We are in serious dilemma. People will condemn themselves by the very act of appealing. If the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), had had to appeal in order to seek selection for a parliamentary seat, she would have identified her clear political commitment. I hope that the Minister follows the gist of my remarks. How would we get round the problem without a McCarthyite witch-hunt?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some legitimate concerns are emerging. The hon. Member for Normanton raised the question of parish councils, which we can reasonably discuss, but I hope that we will not get into questions of McCarthyite witch-hunts. They have no place here.<br><br>
Officers will not have to identify which party they wish to stand for. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State need only have said, "I work as a psychiatric social worker
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0464">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
in this borough and I wish to take part in politics. Will you declare that my job is not restricted?" Officers need not say whether they are Trotskyites, whether they belong to the National Front or whether they are Conservative, Liberal or Labour, so there is no question of witch-hunting. In the cicumstances that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) described, my hon. Friend would not have had to say what her party politics were although, in fact, she did not stand for a local council. She would have had to ascertain only that the nature of her job was compatible with taking an active part in politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Opposition suggest, these matters are complicated. Will my right hon. Friend elaborate on the case of Councillor Dimoldenberg, the leader of the Labour party in Westminster? He used to be a twin-tracking official with the policy unit in the town clerk's department at Southwark, which I regard as being improper in the way that we discussed. His present post is even more improper. He is a director of a public relations company giving strategic advice on planning applications, negotiating with local authority planning officers and making representations to local authorities. That is gross, and I wonder whether it would be covered by the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two situations are entirely different. I hope that my hon. Friend will not mind if I discuss them generally rather than relate my remarks to a particular case of which I have no detailed knowledge.<br><br>
The first sort of job would probably be covered by the Bill as it involves twin-tracking. On the second, there are rules, regulations and codes of conduct, part of which will be updated by the Bill. The declaration of interest that councillors should make, the actions that they may or may not take and the circumstances in which they can serve on committees will be clearly defined. I hope that as a result local authorities will be clear on what information councillors should give about their other activities, which is perfectly reasonable. I cannot deal specifically with my hon. Friend's examples, but in general both are covered by the Bill.<br><br>
I do not want to argue about the nature of party politics but neither do I wish the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) to misunderstand, so I shall explain why I draw a parallel between the extreme Right and the extreme Left.<br><br>
I find racism and classism wholly unacceptable. It is wrong to denigrate some people or to support others because of the class to which they are supposed to belong. Boh are offences against humanity. I do not think, however, that a Christian can be a member of the National Front or a Trotskyite, for example. Neither belief is possible for tbose who hold that the individual must be treated as equal because of the nature of creation. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Tottenham did not follow my distinctions and I have explained them because they are important to both of us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend accept that preaching hatred against any group of people identified by class is wrong? I refer to working class people as well as to people who hold shares in a building society or in a stock company, to directors or to small landlords. They, too, form a class of people, and it is equaly offensive for hatred to be preached against them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to an important point, although I must be careful lest I stray from the amendments.<br><br>
In dealing with the amendments we must not confuse the issues. Can someone who is involved in party politics also be an independent adviser? That consideration applies irrespective of the nature of the party politics.<br><br>
I do not wish disagreement to arise between the hon. Member for Tottenham and me because we are very close in this instance. I agree with him that what is unacceptable in general becomes particularly so if the party-political stance involved is extreme or offensive. Someone whose party party-political stance preaches hatred against any group on unacceptable grounds such as class, race or sex makes the practice of twin-tracking even more offensive. I do not understand why people cannot recognise that if the practice if so offensive when strong political views are involved, it must at least be a little offensive when the views are not so strong. In both instances, however, the person concerned cannot be independent.<br><br>
I say this publicly in case the hon. Member for Tottenham thinks that I have backed down on my commitment. Those involved in the management of a public body, whether it be publicly owned or publicly run, or a private body that deals with the public, should seriously consider whether someone whose party political views would be offensive to those with whom he deals should deal with those people. Whether such a person is guilty of racism, sexism or classism, he might perhaps do what he has to do in circumstances that would not be offensive to others. That is a matter for those in management, and one which I hope they will take seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he does not understand why people regard the Bill's provisions on twin-tracking as offensive. The Bill is offensive because it applies to local government officers to the exclusion of others. Suppose that a doctor has publicly declared that he is against abortion but a female patient seeks his advice on the subject. Could that doctor give impartial advice? That is the nub of the argument. The Government single out local government officers for attack when many others could also be pinpointed. For instance, a bank might be opposed to co-operatives and someone involved in a co-operative might request a loan from his bank. Lawyers are another example. As I said, local government officers are being singled out to the exclusion of other sections in society.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must be careful about how I answer that point. In relation to the amendments, the same argument might be used about the political restrictions on civil servants. If that is the argument, they have been singled out. But that has been with all-party agreement over many years. I remember various comments made by several prominent members on the Left of the Labour party who felt strongly that it was important for civil servants to be independent. It was sometimes argued that they were not independent enough.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tottenham cannot argue that it is inappropriate to say that those who work in an independent capacity for the public should not at the same time pretend that it is possible to take a party political stand. It is not inappropriate to say that.<br><br>
Of course, people in all walks of life are biased. It is difficult for me to understand how people can talk about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0465">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
giving pregnancy advice when the body offering it is committed to one sort of advice. We all have such problems. But in most circumstances an alternative view can be sought. If someone does not like one doctor, he can find another. But in a local authority, it is often "the" person who gives advice, for example, on the future education of a child—I repeat, "the" person; "the" assistant housing manager who is responsible for a group of homes or "the" social services director. There is no alternative. That is part of the problem.<br><br>
Amendment No. 19 would add a new subsection 5(A) requiring the Secretary of State when making regulations under subsection (5) to have regard to any guidance contained in any code of practice applicable to civil servants and to the desirability of incorporating similar provisions within the regulations.<br><br>
Opposition Members appear to be becoming more magnaminous. They would now allow the Secretary of State to define the political restrictions by way of regulations, but would require him in doing so to have regard to any guidance contained in any code of practice applicable to civil servants. For the reasons I have already explained, there are significant differences between the exact situations affecting civil servants and local government officers. Those differences lead one to believe that local government officers should have a lighter rein in several respects. Therefore, it would be wrong to require the Secretary of State to have regard to guidance which is inappropriate to local government matters. I drew the Committee's attention to several examples of that.<br><br>
All the amendments in the group are germane to the Bill. Amendment No. 20, however, gives rise to a wholly different view. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the local authority associations and other concerned organisations before making regulations under subsection (5) defining the terms of appointment or conditions of employment of staff holding politically restricted posts. Unlike some of its companions, the amendment is not mischievous but it is unnecessary. The normal practice of the Secretary of State is to consult the local authority associations and other interested organisations on any regulations affecting local government. Therefore, there is no need to tell him how to do his job. There is a slight lacuna, which worries me. I am keen for there to be as much discussion as possible and for it to continue while we are deliberating on the Bill, but I should not wish it to be suggested that, having had such discussion, we must have it again.<br><br>
Amendment No. 20 is not especially awful but it might have a deleterious effect because it would mean referring back to all the local authority associations for another discussion. I hope, therefore, that the Opposition will agree that amendment No. 20 would not promote the cause which they would hope and might well have a disadvantage. I hope, too, that hon. Members will not wish to proceed with the amendments. I have taken note of the problems and if there appear later to be other ways to deal with some of them, I shall be happy to consider whether other amendments would be acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that during the passage of the Bill, as well as afterwards, he undertakes to consult local authority associations on matters that are germane and of concern to them?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether "undertakes" is the right word. I simply state a matter of fact. We constantly discuss several of the issues with the local authorities and various groups. They have come, and are coming, to us; sometimes we have asked them to do so. The process will continue. I should not like to be more specific than that. But it is a fact that I and my officials have been doing so and will continue so to do.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each of the amendments deals with proposals to allow the Secretary of State to introduce regulations on the question of subsection (5). We feel that the political restrictions should be affirmative and not negative, and that is outlined in our proposals.<br><br>
Amendment No. 21 seeks to include subsection (5A) which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No regulation may be made under subsection (5) above unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
The other amendments are similar. We consider that to restrict political activity, as proposed in the Bill, is a major issue. It is inappropriate, should none of the amendments be accepted, for the restrictions to be imposed through regulations and without consultation. As it has been explained, the restrictions will prevent employees of local authorities from becoming councillors, Members of Parliament or Members of the European Parliament. But what is most important is that the restrictions would prevent any political activity of an individual who is an officer of the local authority as determined by the Secretary of State and the regulations set down by him.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
That is why we suggest that a specific amendment should be targeted to prevent the Secretary of State determining what should be, and is, accepted as political activity. We consider that it is outrageous for the Secretary of State to be given the discretion to decide what political activities will be permitted for tens of thousands of people.<br><br>
The Government have it in mind to restrict such activities as speaking at public meetings on controversial issues. I wonder whether the letter we have received from the chairman of the Kent county council on the planning permission for the Channel tunnel will be brought into the capacity of being a controversial issue. Mr. Hart, the leader of the Kent county council, has sent a letter to Members of Parliament on British Rail's proposals for the high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel. That is a controversial issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. These amendments are extremely narrow. They deal only with an affirmative resolution. Therefore, we cannot go into the broader issue that the hon. Gentleman seeks to raise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 21 seeks to introduce subsection (5A) to safeguard the rights of individuals or members of local authorities because we are concerned about the regulations that will be determined by the Secretary of State. We would prefer to see the determination of political activity and what will prevent officers of local authorities from becoming involved in political activities set out in the Bill and not left to regulations determined by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
In trying to extract from the Minister what will be involved in the regulations we must refer to certain incidents that are taking place around us. I imagine that people outside the House of Commons will wish to have certain issues clarified. It is against that background that I referred to the letter from the leader of the Kent county council. However, I bow to your direction, Mr. Hunt, and shall leave that issue completely.<br><br>
The restrictions that will be determined by the Secretary of State under regulations should be qualified. Earlier, the Secretary of State suggested that the restrictions outlined in the Widdicombe committee report were the ones that the Secretary of State will consider in any forthcoming regulations. If that is the case and there is nothing over and above what is in paragraph 51 of the Widdicombe committee report, why should those restrictions not be included in the Bill instead of allowing regulations to be the permitted procedure for deciding whether the political activity of an officer is correct? That is what the regulations will determine.<br><br>
We suggest that no regulations should be made under subsection (5) unless a draft order has been laid before both Houses. It is important for this matter to be clear. If the amendment is accepted, the issues that cause our concern will be resolved, but if it is not we want to be given reasons why certain activities should be prohibited for local authority employees.<br><br>
The Minister has been manoeuvring within the framework of the Bill but has not really given any information about what will be contained in the regulations.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
We prefer to have a clear-cut decision on what prevents people from taking part in political activities, instead of leaving the decision to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
The grounds for deciding whether a person is engaging in a political activity which prevents him from holding office in local government should be written into the Bill and not left to regulations. We take that view because there will be conflicts of interest and problems of demarcation. There will also be the problem of what applies in one authority not applying in another authority because of different interpretations of the regulations to be determined by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The decision to leave subsection (5) unamended will not be in the best interests of local government. The Minister told us that the legislation will stop jobs for the boys, although Widdicombe showed little evidence of that. The regulations that are to be approved by the Committee will restrict the political activities of more than 70,000 employees, and the Association of County Councils says that that figure will be more like 90,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that? Under the Widdicombe committee's proposals, there was an absolute ban on all people earning more than £13,500 as principal officers and above. We have made it much less onerous. How can the hon. Gentleman suggest that we are going further than the Widdicombe committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Widdicombe report dealt with the matter in three paragraphs. I shall quote paragraph 50:
<br><blockquote><p>"The legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors, or who are standing for election as councillors, or who have been a councillor within the last year, may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above."</p></blockquote>
The difference is that the proposals in the Bill extend well below principal officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The £13,500 level is designed precisely to fit all those who are principal officers and above. That is why it was chosen. There is no extension. We have made the Widdicombe report apply to all councils, because we did not want a council to say, "We have no principal officers", and get round the rules in that way. At the same time, we have introduced a major change, which is not an absolute ban but offers a large number of people the opportunity to appeal and say that they should be excluded. Our proposals are therefore less onerous than those proposed by Widdicombe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) replies, may I say that we are in danger of reopening our previous debate. This is a narrow debate, and I ask hon. Members to stick to the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I intended to do, but I was challenged about the number of people involved. The Association of County Councils has said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is clearly undesirable that the definition of political activity does not appear on the face of the Bill"—</p></blockquote>
that is what I said earlier—
<br><blockquote><p>"but is left to be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations."</p></blockquote>
That was said by the Association of County Councils, which is not a Labour-controlled organisation. It has given the amendment its backing, and it is telling the Secretary of State that the definition of political activity should appear in the Bill. The ACC finds it quite unacceptable for the matter to be left to the Secretary of State to lay down in regulations.<br><br>
If the Minister is not prepared to accept amendment No. 21 which seeks to strengthen the democratic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
procedure in the Bill, will he accept that his friends in the ACC are sending the same message as us, and agree that there is therefore some merit in the amendment? There is cause for the concern that was expressed by the ACC in its letter about the proposals in the Bill:
<br><blockquote><p>"The suggestion that an adjudicator"—</p></blockquote>
running parallel with the regulations proposed in subsection (5)—
<br><blockquote><p>"appointed by central government could have the authority to exempt such employees from the ban on political activity hardly seems realistic or practicable."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of the Association of County Councils. The Minister and his colleagues should pay attention to the wish of their supporters and, in many instances, their constituents, that the Bill be amended in the way that we suggest.<br><br>
This is a targeted amendment. It is an attempt to persuade the Minister to agree that any decision about regulations to be proposed by the Secretary of State should be at the discretion of both Houses of Parliament. The Minister said that the ban on political activities would apply only to people who earn more than £13,500 a year, but that does not apply to the grade of principal officer in London. Will the regulations that will apply if subsection (5) is left unamended apply only to principal officer grade, or will they apply also to clerical grades?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not relevant to this debate. We have already debated all those matters, and we should now concentrate exclusively on the affirmative resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of the 70,000, 90,000 orwhatever number of officers who will be affected is relevant to the regulations that we seek to change. The Minister has suggested who the regulations will apply to, but I hope that he will remove some of the uncertainty and tell us how the regulations will apply before we vote on the amendment. We are probing the Minister to find out what powers the Secretary of State would assume and whose political activities would be restricted. Those issues were raised in the Widdicombe report.<br><br>
If subsection (5) covers everyone who works in local government and earns more than £13,500 a year including, for example, those who are employed to do housing repairs and who thus meet the public, it is even more important that the amendment is accepted. If political restrictions do not apply only to chief officers and above, serious consideration should be given to the fact that it is not only the minority who will be caught by the legislation.<br><br>
As we progress through the Bill, we will discover other matters that give rise to anxiety and we shall expose them, but it will be too late to do anything if members of the Committee are not made aware now of the amendment's impact and importance.<br><br>
The Labour party is determined to strengthen local democracy and to rebuild the partnership between central and local government that has been destroyed to a large degree by the 50 or so Bills that have been introduced by this Government. If there is to be legislation to restrict the activities of those who work in local government, it is important that people understand it. The amendment will help to clear up any uncertainties which may arise.<br><br>
As drafted, the Bill would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations that determine political activities. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
believe that local communities and their elected representatives should be allowed to manage their affairs without being second guessed by Whitehall at every turn.<br><br>
Our belief in local democracy is the cornerstone of our approach, and the amendment would help to rebuild confidence in local government. The figure of £13,500 should be removed from the Bill and regulations should be made only after approval by both Houses of Parliament. We would prefer those regulations to apply only to principal officers and above. We have no faith in the Secretary of State's power to decide which political activities will be covered by regulations. Only Parliament should have that authority.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept this progressive amendment which would help to determine what is deemed to be a political activity and who would be involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall not spend too much time on the amendment. There are two reasons why it is not acceptable. The first is the nature of the advice given to the House by the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation which recommended in its report published in 1973 that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The affirmative procedure is normally appropriate for powers substantially affecting provisions of Acts of Parliament; powers to impose or increase taxation or other financial burdens on the subject or to raise statutory limits on the amounts which may be borrowed by or lent or guaranteed to public bodies; or other powers involving considerations of special importance, such as those creating new varieties of criminal offence of a serious nature."</p></blockquote>
Compared with the criteria laid down by the House, the procedure in the Bill, not that in the amendment, is right.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said that it was outrageous that regulations affecting tens of thousands of people should be made in this way. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor his party has complained about the way in which regulations affecting the Civil Service are made. They are made by Orders in Council—the last was updated in 1982—which do not permit the House of Commons to complain about them. Orders in Council give Civil Service Ministers—in this case the Prime Minister—absolute discretion when laying down the rules by which civil servants may partake in party politics. They affect hundreds of thousands of people. It is odd that, having accepted those provisions for all these years, the Labour party strains at a situation in which we seek to help them. We have not insisted on an Order in Council and thus removed the regulations from the scrutiny of the House of Commons; we have suggested that a negative resolution would be the right way in which to proceed.<br><br>
We say that, in the case of local government officers, there should be greater scrutiny by Parliament than there is in the case of civil servants. Accepting the amendment would be contrary to the advice given by the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation. Our suggestions are more open to parliamentary scrutiny than the mechanisms used for civil servants. The amendments are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of amendments Nos. 8, 14 and 15 is similar to that of amendment No. 21. They seek to persuade the Minister to put the proposal to the House in the form of a positive resolution.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the Minister's justification of the proposed arrangement. As is his habit, he portrayed the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
case as one with which no reasonable person could disagree. It is true that the regulations mentioned in subsection (5) are linked to those which apply to civil servants in politically restricted groups, but Widdicombe, when discussing the Civil Service rules, pointed out that they were based on reasonable consensus, as the Minister has said frequently.<br><br>
Widdicombe said that, in formulating the rules, the
<br><blockquote><p>"prohibition depends for its acceptability on the possibility of exemptions being granted on a case by case basis and on a reasonable consensus as to when such exemptions should be granted."</p></blockquote>
By allowing the Secretary of State to produce his own regulations, the Bill allows for no such consensus as regards local authority employees. It is that which makes the amendments so important. On an issue of this nature, whether in local government or elsewhere, we should not take away liberties without consensus across the political range.<br><br>
The Minister's proposals do not have that broad political consensus, nor are they even the subject of consensus among his hon. Friends. I draw his attention to the comments of the Association of District Councils in particular, as it is Conservative-run, and remind him that, as I said earlier, the association stated that the Bill is:
<br><blockquote><p>"far more restrictive than was anticipated in the White Paper in terms of the political restricted posts … and we shall wish to explore the extent to which this extension is necessary."</p></blockquote>
The association said that it:
<br><blockquote><p>"would wish to see the 'political activities' which are to be prescribed under Clause 1 defined on the face of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has rightly said that the ADC is not opposed to the Government's proposals. Indeed, it has welcomed the broad thrust of his intentions, but it shares the concern that ranges across the political spectrum that the powers that would be taken through subsection (5) are so broad and so important to fundamental liberties that they should either be defined in the Bill or, as that has been rejected, subject to positive affirmation. Similarly, the Association of County Councils has expressed its concern that the powers are not laid out in the Bill.<br><br>
I have said repeatedly since Second Reading that such matters are fundamental in a democracy. We must always be reluctant to make such changes, and we must examine them in fine detail to establish that they are absolutely necessary and do not go beyond what is acceptable. I am worried that, however good the Minister's intentions, he is being given wide-ranging discretionary powers. It is not necessarily the Minister or the Secretary of State who, ultimately, will make regulations under these powers.<br><br>
The Bill gives the Secretary of State complete discretion in drawing up regulations that will affect the lives of tens of thousands of town hall staff. The right hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading that the Government are mirroring as far as possible the rules that apply to the Civil Service. If that is so, it should be stated clearly in the Bill. That option was rejected, so we must ensure that both House, of Parliament are given full rein to debate the proposals properly. This is a major issue that should be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and open consultation. I beg the Committee to accept the amendments. They were not designed to be wrecking amendments or to change the nature of the Bill—they seek simply to ensure that a major constitutional issue is handled properly by all parts of the House so as to reach the reasonable consensus that Widdicome recommended.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 2, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(5A) Nothing in section 140(1) below shall apply in respect of regulations made under this section'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 25, in page 2, line 46, leave out from 'exceptions' to 'as' in line 47.<br><br>
No. 24, in clause 140, page 118, line 3, after 'Act', insert 'except under section 1(5)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition consider that there is nothing in subsection (5) that deals adequately with the regulations. Clause 140(1) allows the Secretary of State to make different provision for
<br><blockquote><p>"different cases and different descriptions of cases (including different provision for different areas.)"</p></blockquote>
I expressed concern about it, Mr. Hunt, when you drew my attention to the fact that we were straying from the amendments. I appreciated your guidance at the time.<br><br>
Our amendments seek to probe areas of possible concern where differences of opinion could be expressed and the Secretary of State's power—we have seen patronage before—could be used to reward friends and punish foes. If such a situation is to apply in local government, we are anxious to ensure that there is protection under the terms of amendment No. 23.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that I would deny any such partiality. Will he give examples of the way in which regulations could be advantageous to friends and disadvantageous to others?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. There are many. A clear example is the attitude of the Minister's colleague who has responsibility for health authorities. There are a number of examples where, because there is no strict interpretations of regulations in legislation, rewards are there for some and there is different treatment for people who oppose the functions and proposals of the Government. I could give numerous examples but I know that you, Mr. Hunt, would rise from your Chair if I did. If the Minister wants examples of regulations and actions by Ministers and by Secretaries of State that have rewarded friends and punished foes, I can only say that the Government are providing plenty at present. I wish to place on record the Opposition's anxiety. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) must accept that I was hoping for examples. I am genuinely in the business of trying to ensure that the legislation is as effective as possible.<br><br>
I have racked my brains, but I cannot think of an example where the hon. Gentleman's fears would arise. There is clear provision for Parliament to supervise the legislation though the negative resolution procedure, which is without doubt proper protection. At present we have no intention of applying different regulations to different classes of people. We are discussing the matter with local government organisations, and they might make proposals on which the Secretary of State was minded to act and which would need the flexibility provided by the present arrangements.<br><br>
The Committee must remember my advice about Parliament's own joint Committee on legislation and the position of civil servants, which Opposition Members have not criticised so far. The hon. Member for Normanton has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0469">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
not provided one example of his fears. They are generalised and the Committee should not take them too seriously.<br><br>
The other amendments in the group are mild-mannered and do not sound too bad, but must be rejected for similar reasons. Flexibility is valuable, especially as we wish to ensure that as much advice from local authorities as possible can be taken on board. The Secretary of State's powers are not unfettered. The negative resolution has been found wholly satisfactory in other circumstances and provides considerably greater protection than would regulations that are, in effect, designed to cover the activities of civil servants.<br><br>
For reasons similar to those that I gave on the previous group of amendments, this group is also unsuitable and I hope that the Committee will reject them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall apologise to the Committee and explain my frequent absences today, which I regret. They are partly connected with the housing problems that the Minister visits on me. When no fewer than 60 people who are threatened by the Irish Republican Army turn up from Northern Ireland and ask for housing in Hammersmith, it causes marginal problems.<br><br>
We also have a slight problem with borrowing on the financial market. The practice was started by the Conservative party in Hammersmith and was run successfully by the Labour party to produce a £12 million profit, but it is now thrown into some doubt by the Secretary of State. I have encountered one or two little local difficulties which I hope will not continue when I have helped the Secretary of State out of the hole into which he has fallen.<br><br>
I also take the opportunity, Mr. Hunt, to apologise for the fact that I shall have to be absent for part of our sitting on Thursday morning as I shall be attending the 250th anniversary of the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea hospital at Westminster abbey.<br><br>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) for moving the amendments in my absence. I picked up from one of the Minister's comments that my hon. Friend said that amendment No. 23 is a probing amendment. It is not so much that we are prepared to give the Minister a little list to take away and look at. As he knows, there has been a long period of serious doubt about the Government's commitment to local and national democracy.<br><br>
There has been a problem not only on wider issues but on legislation such as this. Statutory instruments have been used to get through the House the Commons measures that would normally have been effected in primary legislation. That would be more appropriate here. The Government have also used directions from the Secretary of State's office. As a result we have to debate legislation that is badly thought out and not very specific.<br><br>
The Minister of the day gains enormous power to make rules and regulations. The Government have filled posts in the public arena at their whim, but turn on local authorities whenever a similar example arises in local government. We are probing to find out how the Minister intends to use his power.<br><br>
I understand the Minister's answer. He tried to reassure us that there would be no problem because the power would not be misused. We may have to judge his assurance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
over time. The Government's record is not good in this respect, so to a considerable extent they are on probation—or perhaps the term "suspended sentence" is more appropriate.<br><br>
Amendment No. 25 involves a question that the Minister did not answer. I should like him to pursue it although I do not wish to prolong the discussion as this is not a core debate. The Civil Service code has a blanket approach to dispensations which does not apply here. Why is that approach appropriate for the Civil Service but not for local government?<br><br>
No one is arguing that local government and the Civil Service are the same. A central part of our argument is that local government should not be treated in the same way, but in their approach to deciding who can be employed in local government and who can take part in political activity the Government have embarked on the road chosen by the Civil Service. What is the Government's justification for constraining local authorities with a tougher and more restrictive code of practice than applies to central Government?<br><br>
The Government's actions are not fair or consistent with their argument. I am the first to accept that the similarity between the Civil Service and local government is not all that great. There are important and significant differences, but it is not for me to prove them. It is up to the Government to show why, as they have chosen to draw up codes for local government that have something in common with the Civil Service code, they are imposing a different and tougher standard on local authorities than they impose on themselves in national Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's last sentence explains my difficulty. He refers to a different and tougher standard. It is difficult to maintain that the standard is tougher; it is different because we have tried to make it as easy as possible.<br><br>
There is a clear similarity between civil servants and local government officers, although they are not the same. Their differences are not central and do not mean that we can say, "Although civil servants cannot take part in political activities, local government officers can." As I have said, historically local government officers have taken an active part in discussion of local government matters—certainly using a particular tone—in the national press as well as in local government newspapers and magazines in a way that would not be considered appropriate for civil servants of a similar seniority. We wished to put into legislative form the best practice up to now.<br><br>
Another difference arises from the fact that, although many people would disagree, teachers and head teachers employed in education have thought it reasonable to do their job and engage in party political activity. Were those people doing a similar job as civil servants, they might well be excluded from party politics. Therefore, we are placing a lighter burden on local authority employees than is placed on civil servants. I find it difficult to see how this will be a heavier burden.<br><br>
Making an appeal to an adjudicator is open to each individual and I can see no reason why an adjudicator might not say, for example, that those involved in running crematoria will not need to ask individually for permission to become involved in political activity because he may accept them as a group. Further, the adjudicator could say that people involved in the technical provision of computer services for a local authority, and not concerned
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
with giving advice, will be excluded as a group. That would be perfectly reasonable. I hope that the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) accepts that I take his point that there are lessons to be learnt about Civil Service codes.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendments is to restrict the Secretary of State's ability to make regulations. I find the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Government's commitment to democracy unacceptable. We are introducing the Bill because of our commitment to democracy. We believe that these matters are important. It is not conducive to democracy for the fair name of local government to be so besmirched by the activities that we seek to outlaw. We believe that they do great harm to local government. I am committed to local government and very anxious to raise the standards and, above all, the view that the public has of local government.<br><br>
In my experience, local government has found it hard to re-establish itself in the public's mind, but not for the reason given by the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Rather it is because the goings on in many extremists councils make people think that local authorities are not to be trusted.<br><br>
What has happened in Brent, Haringey, Lambeth and Camden makes it difficult for the public to trust local government. Anyone who watched last night's "Panorama" programme must have wondered what was happening in Manchester. The standing of local authorities, to which the hon. Member for Hammersmith referred, has been harmed by the extremist councils to which I have referred.<br><br>
I am not going to be led into a discussion of the hon. Gentleman's comments about the use of public money in Hammersmith and Fulham. When the hon. Gentleman reads the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, he will come to the same conclusions as outsiders—that we will have to wait for the courts to rule on whether those activities were illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must try to counsel caution on the Minister. When he uses words such as "extremist councils" that says much more about his political position than that of the councils. One thing about political labels is that they tell us more about the person who is using the label than the person or body around whose neck the label is hung.<br><br>
If the Minister is talking about councils with extremist policies, he should include Westminster, which he was careful not to mention. If, as he always tells us, he wants to be even handed, why does he not include Westminster in his descriptions of extremist councils?</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue that argument too far, but I would compare Westminster with Barking and Dagenham. They are two perfectly reasonable councils. I happen to agree with the party politics of one, but not with those of the other. When I use the term "extremist council" I use it in the generally accepted sense that people who vote Labour in the hope of securing a moderate council would be appalled if the council that they elected behaved like Camden council, which is an extremist council. The comparison is clear.<br><br>
When I talk to labour councillors, I notice that if I mention the word Derbyshire, they all look round as though they have dropped something on the floor, in case they are asked to comment on Mr. Bookbinder.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
Derbyshire is another extremist council, whereas the next-door council of Nottinghamshire, although not terribly good, is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going down the road of massive irrelevancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, but the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has that effect on me.<br><br>
I must tell the hon. Member for Hammersmith that I think it would be better to leave matters as they are in the Bill. I can give him an assurance, which I hope he will accept, about the impartiality of the regulations that will be made. I hope very much that we shall be able to take fully into account the advice given to us by local authority organisations, and that the hon. Gentleman wil facilitate that by not restricting the Secretary of State in the way that the amendments propose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments have probed into an important part of the Bill. We are worried about the powers that can be given to the Secretary of State, and I maintain that they could be used to provide rewards for friends and punishments for foes. The Minister said that we gave no examples. I do not want to broaden my commments, but there are plenty of examples. For a start, there are more than 1,600 quangos which are politically appointed—they include residuary bodies. If the Minister looks into those quangos, I think that he will find that our fears are real.<br><br>
Our amendments have been an attempt to stop the politicisation of appointments in local government and other government services. I do not intend to press the amendments, but I stress their significance, and I hope that the Minister will note that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we embark on this debate, I must point out that we have had wide-ranging debates on all the groups of amendments and I therefore hope that hon. Members will keep their remarks very brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you say, Mr. Hunt, and I take this opportunity to thank you for allowing the debates to go wide on a number of occasions to cover many of the issues. That should save some time now.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) had intended to speak in this debate, but unfortunately he has had to leave as he has a very heavy cold. I shall endeavour to cover the main points.<br><br>
I reiterate the central argument about the Bill and the Government's conduct of the nation's affairs in recent years. They are undermining and devaluing democracy whenever they can. One of their soft options for attack is local authorities, which cannot hit back effectively. In Parliament, we can at least win the argument, even if we lose the vote, but the officers and councillors of many councils are being told that they do not have a useful job to do.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has said that his ideal local authority meeting is one that happens only once a year to hand out contracts after dinner. What commitment is that to local democracy? I hope that the Minister will answer that question, because he serves a Secretary of State who has stated that that is his ideal local authority. Does the Minister in charge of this Bill agree with that statement?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
Does he think that local authorities should meet only once a year to hand out contracts, or does he think that they should meet more often? We certainly believe that they should meet more often.<br><br>
Opposition Members take the view that all councillors volunteer their services, usually at considerable personal cost, and get virtually nothing out of it financially. The standard of conduct in British local authorities is good, is known to be good, and is admired throughout the world. There is none of the corruption that is found in other parts of the world. People do not go into it to advance themselves. Men and women who are committed to various political beliefs put their feelings into action by standing for election, and they see nothing wrong in principle in working for a public authority in another sector. On the whole, that is right.<br><br>
The Widdicombe report said that there was not a significant problem, but the Minister has consistently dodged that finding. The Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association said that this Bill is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Does the Minister agree? Why does he have to use a sledgehammer?<br><br>
There is a case, which we accept, for saying that directors and deputy directors should not be involved in political activity and should not work for another council, but it is not right to go below that level. My view, and increasingly it is becoming the view of people in other political parties, is that we are over cautious about involvement in politics. The Civil Service is over proscribed, and there is no reason why grades in both the Civil Service and local government should not be more able to take part in the political process. The trouble with the Government is that they are a little ashamed of political democracy. They think that it would be better if people did not take part in it and that it should be left to the Government—by which they mean, of course, the Conservative party.<br><br>
Political appointments are put in place most effectively by a Conservative Government. The Minister consistently dodged the appallingly blatant example in the Conservative party of Mr. Bernard Ingham, who is neither independent nor impartial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. How can the hon. Gentleman relate Mr. Bernard Ingham to the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because we have a Government who claim, as we have heard the Minister claim throughout our debate on the clause, that they are justified in doing this to local authorities because people are not seen to be politically independent, that they are paid out of the public purse and are public servants. I am telling the Minister that the Government constantly appoint people who are politically partial, who are not politically independent, and who are paid out of the public purse. Mr. Bernard Ingham is paid out of the public purse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it proper for a member of the Committee to attack by name a civil servant, who has to be independent, in circumstances where that individual is unable to reply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is undesirable to make a comment of that sort about a civil servant but I, as Chairman, have no way of preventing it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. Is it in order for the Minister to attack local government officers by name, as he attacked Linda Bellos, without her having an opportunity to reply? Surely you must rule against the Minister, Mr. Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled that I regret personalisation of debates. That applies to both sides of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand your problem, Mr. Hunt. I do not like attacking people who cannot reply, but Mr. Ingham has greater opportunity than many of us to do so.<br><br>
The basis of the Government's attack has been to attack individual councils and councillors. For the Government to complain when we name people who are being used by the Conservative party, but paid for by the public purse is an appalling example of double standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in saying that, at some time in his career, Mr. Ingham stood for local authority election as a Labour candidate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a clue whether or not he did so. It does not matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that. No one is saying anything other than that Mr. Ingham is paid for from the public purse and does what the Prime Minister wishes. If Tory Members have any doubts about that, they should ask the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), who said so publicly. If I am ruled out of order in attacking Mr. Ingham, the right hon. Member for Henley should be so ruled, as a Secretary of State and as a Back Bencher, because he has said precisely what I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the hon. Gentleman see that there is a distinction between attacking a civil servant who has not ventured into politics recently, although he may have done so in the past, and saying that a person who is elected as a councillor, as Miss Linda Bellos was, can, as a councillor, be discussed in political terms? The hon. Gentleman spoke about a civil servant who cannot reply. I spoke of a councillor who has every possibility of replying because of her election as a councillor. She is also a local government officer. When it suits her to be one, she is one, and when it suits her to be the other, she is the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only say that I think that the right hon. Member for Henley was right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I give my hon. Friend a little more evidence? It was the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) who talked about the corrupting influence of the Prime Minister's press office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the Government have deliberately set up local councillors as the target, while at the same time appointing their own friends in their own areas. Another example of this is in the Ministry of Defence. There has been an outcry in the press—even in the Conservative press—challenging the wisdom and desirability of the practice in terms of democracy—and of the corruptibility of the state at the end of the day.<br><br>
Area health authorities, for example, have been stacked with Tory Members' supporters. What about EEC commissioners? Two were supposed to serve for two years. One was Conservative, the other Labour. The Prime Minister did not like the behaviour of the Conservative so she sacked him and gave the job to someone who was one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
of the instigators of a leak in the House—which is supposed to be a terrible crime. She then sacked the Labour commissioner and had to replace him. It is nonsense. The Government are using patronage in a way that undermines the democratic process. They pretend that they are not doing it, and are trying to clean their hands by attacking local authorities, which are less able to answer back than any member of the Government or anyone in the Prime Minister's press office. The Minister treads dangerous ground by saying that these people are in a weaker position.<br><br>
I return to the Widdicombe report. If there had been evidence from an independent person—Mr. David Widdicombe—that the problem was significant, we would listen to the Minister. But Mr. Widdicombe said that there was no significant abuse. The Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association has said that the Government are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Even the Government's supporters, as well as independent advisers, say that there is no problem. But clause 1 and other clauses propose to hammer local authorities.<br><br>
The Government do what they do on another basis. We had an example a few moments ago when the Minister accused people of being extremists. My hon. Friends rightly said that as "extremists" on Labour councils were being mentioned, why not mention Westminster? We got into problems with names again. I do not need to name names: I need say only, "Westminster". I do not know the definition of "extremism", but I shall return to it. If a council can sell graveyards for 15p each and have to buy them back for £5 million, is that not extremism? Is that a normal pattern of behaviour for a local authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair is saying that that has nothing to do with clause 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing, Mr Hunt—the link is indirect, but important—that the Government maintain that the clause is necessary to get at local authorities which abuse the system. The Minister talked of extremism. On many occasions the Minister and the Secretary of State have attacked so-called extremist local authorities and justified the Bill on that basis.<br><br>
I warn the Minister that it is difficult to define extremism. I know what it means for me. If I use the word "extremism"—which I do not do often—I mean authoritarianism, which means the Conservative party. When the Government talk of extremism, they mean what they dispute as being common sense. They say that some practice is not common sense, or is nonsense, when talking about a local authority. So they label such authorities as "loony Left". The danger is that what is common sense today turns out to be common nonsense tomorrow, and vice versa. If we accepted the basis of Tory philosophy, we would still believe that the earth was flat because it looks flat. We would still believe that the sun goes round the earth because we see it go round. We would believe that because it is common sense. In politics, national or local, we have to watch out for authoritarianism, not for common nonsense, common sense or extremism. Authoritarianism is dangerous, and it is deeply rooted in the Conservative party.<br><br>
The clause contains another example of authoritarianism. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) knows what I mean. The clause affects Scotland, but there has been no recourse to the proper Scottish legislative system and no Scottish Minister sits on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
the Government Front Bench. The provisions are being imposed on Scotland without the Government using the proper procedures which were usually employed in the past in the House. This is happening without there being a mandate in Scotland, where the Coservative party was routed and virtually driven out of the political system, not merely decisively beaten. Yet the Government are happy to include in clause after clause, including clause 1, a small section that extends provisions to Scotland. That is what I call authoritarianism. It is doing to people something which they do not wish without giving them a chance to put their Local Government and Housing point of view. We are fortunate in having my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East in Committee to express the viewpoint of Scotland. But that will not happen for the Conservative party. There is not one Scottish Tory Member present to speak about the Bill's effects on Scotland. That confirms my view that the Government have adopted an authoritarian attitude.<br><br>
I raised the question of magistrates with the Minister and he challenged me to table an amendment. I did so, to a previous Bill. I will tell the Minister how the Government responded. They said, "We think that it would be useful to have on police committees people who represent the political view as well as being magistrates." In other words, they meant that twin-tracking was a good idea.<br><br>
In a way, that is the worst possible example because a keystone of the British democratic tradition is the separation of power. Magistrates interpret the law and decide who is guilty and who innocent. The police enforce the law and decide who is to be arrested and who is to be charged. If we link the two processes we get into dangerous water.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) rushes in where wise men fear to tread—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a fool.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's definition that he is not a fool.<br><br>
I shall remind the Committee how magistrates came to serve on police committees. They were added to their membership during the previous century when it was believed that local government did not have enough experience to justify giving seats only to councillors. It was regarded then as a short-term measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When magistrates are appointed, they will have completed a questionnaire which asks to which political party they belong. They are appointed on a ratio of political views. The number of magistrates on a police authority reflects also the political balance. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is not present, but in the days of south Yorkshire, the controlling Labour group decided that all magistrates were Tories. It gave the Conservatives three members on the police authority, although according to the political balance we were entitled to more. We must remember the political balance that applies to magistrates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hallam does not understand the argument. I said that magistrates were put forward partly, although not entirely, on a political basis. As the hon. Gentleman knows, they come also from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
backgrounds other than political parties. Magistrates are put on police committees although, according to the hon. Gentleman's Minister—not mine; I do not agree—they cannot give independent advice because they are political appointees.<br><br>
The Minister says, "People nominated in this way can't be independent. As a member of the public you wouldn't have any confidence in them." That is wrong. I have every confidence in a councillor, a Member of Parliament or a magistrate whose political views may be completely different from mine until I know that that person does not do his or her job properly or fairly. I have received good advice from Conservative and Liberal councillors and even from Conservative Members of Parliament. If their advice is fair and right it is OK. In many cases it is, regardless of political party. Often the questions asked of a councillor, magistrate or Member of Parliament do not involve party-political judgment.<br><br>
I suspect that the good councillor or Member of Parliament say to each constituent, "What can I do to help you?" If a policy question is involved, good councillors and Members of Parliament explain their party policy and say why they will or will not do what the constituent wants. In my experience, if a question is straightforward—for example, what help a constituent is entitled to in particular circumstances—good councillors and Members of Parliament give the answer regardless of political affiliation. The same is true of magistrates, but the Minister does not agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been a long-serving member of a county council which had a police authority. Once the police authority broke into political lines the magistrates did not vote. They stepped back from the brink and power passed to the controlling group and to the opposition. Even though magistrates served on the authority, as soon as they entered the political arena they stepped back and identified themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true in some instances, but from my experience in other areas I can tell the hon. Member for Hallam that that is not always the case. An argument against magistrates serving on police committees is that they have to take political sides. Magistrates have often asked to be removed. In some areas they have rightly stepped back. In others they have become deeply involved in a way that some of them later regretted, and the hon. Member for Hallam may know of such instances.<br><br>
I have spoken for longer than I intended, but I have given way to one or two interventions.<br><br>
I argue strongly, with the support of all the Opposition Members who are members of the Committee, that the Government are going down a dangerous road which they have not justified. It can be understood inside or outside the House only as a reflection of their deep dislike of local authority democracy. That is summed up, sadly, in the Secretary of State's statement that local authorities should meet about once a year to hand out contracts. What that does to the morale of councillors and officers should be underestimated. I do not know how people can work up the enthusiasm to serve on local authorities as councillors or officers. They are told constantly that they are parasites on the state and are taking away the wealth of the nation.<br><br>
In almost every other democratic country they are regarded as an essential part of the infrastructure,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
providing a good basis for the social welfare and economic development of a community. With 1992 round the corner, Europe is devolving power to local authorities as was done immediately after the second world war and in Spain after Franco's demise. This Government, alone in the European Community, are smashing local authorities, removing power and undermining the morale and confidence of officers and councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) must not base his judgment of the morale of local councillors on what is happening in the Labour party. In the London borough of Ealing, many people are anxious to become councillors. They are being interviewed and selected now for next year's borough council elections. There is no shortage of enthusiastic and capable condidates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The same is true in the Labour party. The hon. Gentleman should talk to his colleagues in the London Boroughs Association and in the Association of District Councils. They express similar feelings to mine, although not in such strong terms. They believe that the Government are devaluing local authorities. The Labour party will get members to stand, but I find it amazing that people continue to put themselves forward as officers or councillors when they are constantly harassed, attacked, undermined and abused by the Government. That is why we shall vote against the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to argue that it would be better to do things differently—we sit on opposite sides of the House of Commons because we have different ways of looking at problems. However, it is not reasonable for him to suggest that clause 1 is an assault on local domocracy. Its purpose is to enhance local democracy by removing the damage done to it by the activities that will be outlawed. Its genesis was an anxiety about the growing feeling that individuals were using local authorities as employers so that they could act as full-time councillors elsewhere. In many instances they were not seen as independent local council officers because of their political activities elsewhere.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith disagrees with me but there is impressive independent evidence for what I say. A major association of senior officers had to adjust its rules because some appointments of chief officers were made on party political grounds. An independent report stated that whatever the problem now, it was necessary to legislate to prevent further difficulties. Those are grounds for concern. I shall put it as delicately and uncontroversially as I can, but when many people are both councillors and local authority employees, it causes alarm, as was shown by public reaction to the practice.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was it a similar concern for the strengthening of local democracy that led the Government to abolish the metropolitan county councils and to impose stringent financial controls on local authorities such as had not been seen for 400 years? Was that part of the general concern for local democracy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that I would not have to be too party political on this occasion. Most harm was done to local democracy by local authorities—they are now abolished—that did not have a purpose, cost a great deal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
of money and wasted most of it. No one in London can now remember what the Greater London council did. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]<br><br>
I support the clause because it was drafted in the light of experience common to both sies of the House of Commons. The Government abolished the metropolitan county councils and the Labour party has reversed its decision to reinstate them. It is a common view that local government at that level is not needed. The Government are honest enough to say that it should not have been introduced. We invented the metropolitan county councils and we abolished them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not intervening to widen the debate to a discussion of the structure of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Definitely not. I am obliged for your protection, Mr. Hunt. Does my right hon. Friend agree that some metropolitan and district councils were classic examples of authorities where twin-tracking was the rule, not the exception?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the notorious examples of twin-tracking do not have to be dealt with because they occurred in the metropolitan county councils. I shall not go into detail about the South Yorkshire authority, which contained some unattractive elements. Its abolition removed the need to legislate to improve it. My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the issue.<br><br>
The clause will enhance the reputation of local government. It is important that the public are aware that their local councillor has a particular and valuable role. It is not my custom to say whether I agree with my hon. Friends with Secretaries of State or with others, but if the hon. Member for Hammersmith asks me my view of the role of local councillors, I shall direct him to independent speeches. I am committed to the concept that local authorities play a vital part in Government and I am anxious that that part should be enhanced and extended. Local authorities should be the focus in a locality for a range of activities. Local authorities enable people to do things that they could not do on their own. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will read my speeches to the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, to the local government conference of the Conservative party at the end of this week and later to the Central Council, in which I shall state the role of local authorities. If I made those speeches today, Mr. Hunt, you would call me to order.<br><br>
Local authorities cannot have an enhanced role unless they have public confidence, and there are two ways of ensuring it. First, one has to ensure that officers—and their advice—are independent. That would prevent what happened in the London borough of Ealing, where soon after a change in local authority control, almost every senior officer left employment in that authority. That would be considered outrageous if it happened in central Government. If a Conservative Government fell and a Labour Government came to power, for example, it would be thought a considerable danger to democracy if all major civil servants resigned, retired or were forcibly thrown out. It would be seen as a decline in democracy and the high standard of independence of civil servants.<br><br>
Many authorities have problems in attracting independent and excellent local authority officers, for two reasons. First, the prospective officers see how others have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
treated. Secondly, they fear that they will not be able to give the independent advice which they expect to give. Therefore, they see politicisation as damaging to the independence of local authority officers.<br><br>
I have been criticised for using the word "extremist". I thought that it was a polite word. The hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) referred to his local authority as being worse than the Pol Pot regime. If that is not an extremist regime, I would find it difficult to imagine any other definition. I could give other examples, but I do not think that extremist is too rude a word. An extremist authority is one which takes its political views to such an extreme that it becomes noticeable to the vast majority of the population. There are a number of local authorities of that sort. The local authority in Derbyshire is another good example. It is thought to be extreme even by those who support the politics of that council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We hear several local authorities named every time the Minister speaks. Are they the sum total of his evidence—only three among the thousands in the country? Will the Minister now give us substantial evidence on which he bases the Bill? The reason why we have to keep intervening, Mr. Hunt, is that the Minister has not made a substantial case for the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not tempt me down that route, because my evidence would be complete and conclusive. I shall go through a series of local authorities in London alone. Just look at the twin-tracking in Lambeth, Haringey, Camden, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham. The hon. Gentleman should watch his words. He said thousands of local authorities, but there are only 405 in England. The fact is that in the authorities which I mentioned there is sometimes twin-tracking among half the members of the council. The evidence is there. Many articles have been printed about them, not all of them written by me either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend about the six London authorities to which he referred, and as he said, there are many similar authorities outside London. There are no fewer than seven Labour councillors in each of those authorities who are twin-tracking, and that does not include teachers, of course, who are outside the scope of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about 42 cases. I admit that there is little twin-tracking in some authorities, but they tend to be a long way from other Labour authorities, which may explain why the Labour party's local government conference was in Southampton. I suppose it is the only place far enough away from any other Labour-controlled authority to have no twin-trackers taking part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Franks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer my right hon. Friend not to the local authority with, which I was originally connected, in Manchester, which experienced tremendous difficulties in recruiting officers having disposed of every officer who was worth while once the extreme element of the Labour party took control, but to my own local authority in Barrow-in-Furness. When the extreme element of the Labour party took control there, the town clerk retired at the earliest opportunity. A gentleman from Glasgow was recruited as chief executive 12 months ago because he was politically acceptable. He is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
now facing the chop because, to the surprise of a certain element of the Labour party, he has not done precisely what it told him to do.<br><br>
Can I also say to the Minister—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is quite enough to be going on with.</span></p>
