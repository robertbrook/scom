</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have moved from unit trusts to life assurance, which is covered in clauses 78 to 86, schedule 9 and clause 169. Hon. Members doubtless will have received representations from various bodies and it will come as no surprise that the Opposition have tabled some amendments suggested by those bodies. Amendment No. 366, which was suggested by the Association of British Insurers, is important because it seeks to plug a loophole in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together, the amendments seek to do two things. First, the Bill will abolish the present reduced rate of tax on capital gains policyholders with effect from Budget day. Under the new arrangements, nothing will be operative until 1 January 1990. The amendments attempt to keep the reduced rate in existence until 1 January 1990. The Opposition are usually not in favour of giving away money that perhaps should have gone to the Inland Revenue, but we are not talking about the capital gains of a few people who by and large make huge capital gains—that is the crucial point. We are talking about funds, life assurance and something that affects in some way or another the vast majority of people. It is important to have a regime for life assurance that is seen to be fair, and it seems that the Government have made an error in drafting the Bill. Does the Financial Secretary intend to pursue Government amendment No. 309? If so, that would mitigate one of the worst aspects of the Bill and put something right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, our amendments seek to give the life offices time in which to adapt. Some companies, especially those with unit business—the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) will be interested in this in view of his recent speech on unit trusts and his obvious interest in the topic—will have difficulties if our amendments are not accepted. Problems arise about whether a company has an investment reserve. There is an investment reserve if a company has a good profits business and transfers are made actuarily into the revenue account. However, with unit-linked policies, all gains are usually transferred immediately, so an investment reserve may not be helped. The difficulty is that under the Bill only transfers to the investment reserve are recognised for tax purposes. Many companies that do not have one will lose out through no fault of their own. The amendments may perhaps create too wide an area for companies to be able to manage their affairs in time so that less tax is paid than ought to be paid, but under the Bill some companies will pay more tax than they should. Legislation should catch the companies, and that is the aim of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's proposals for the reform of life assurance, which are important. They represent a reduction in rates but a broadening of the base, which is a more rational way of taxing life assurance. We shall debate the treatment of the industry's acquisition expenses. We believed that the expenses were over-relieved and we shall return to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 78, together with clause 79, provides for the occasions when life business, or parts of it, are taxed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
by reference to trading profits. The two clauses together bring greater internal consistency to the calculation of taxable profits, and match it more closely to companies' own accounting treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 78 defines the way in which amounts set aside for policy-holders are taken into account in calculating profits. It replaces an existing relief and ties the relief for allocations to policy holders or annuitants to the amounts reflected in companies' own accounts and statutory returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) asked whether we would pursue amendment No. 309. The answer is yes. It is a minor improvement to the machinery securing transition from the old rules to the new. As drafted, the savings provisions in clause 80 do not adequately secure that the lower policyholder rate of tax will apply to the policyholder proportion of gains accruing between Budget day and 1 January 1990. The industry has expressed concern at that, and the amendment is designed to keep the old relief alive until the new rules and new rates come into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments moved by the hon. Gentleman—especially Nos. 366 and 367—centre upon the starting date for clause 78. Amendment No. 367, together with the associated amendments, would give companies the option of overturning the Government's decision to implement from Budget day the new rules about amounts set aside for policyholders. The choice of Budget day for the abolition of the old rule and the introduction of the new was founded upon the exceptional difficulties that the existing relief has given and upon the prospect of serious eleventh-hour abuse of the relief if it were allowed to run on past the announced date of its repeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current relief is not tied to any standard accountancy concept, and it is not reliably linked to defined liabilities to policyholders. Some people have suggested that companies may claim the relief at their "discretion", and we foresaw a danger that postponement of the introduction of the new test might precipitate a bandwagon effect. In other words, we feared that there might be some forestalling. Companies that have made no use of the relief in the past may decide, for competitive reasons, that the interests of their policyholders and shareholders now require them to make that claim. I cannot estimate the cost of any forestalling, but it could be hundreds of millions of pounds. The new rules that are embodied in the clause are sensible and fair and impose no new compliance costs on companies, so we see no merit in the proposal that companies should not pay it from Budget day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The Financial Secretary said that policyholders should not necessarily expect benefits whatever action that the Government take on taxation. That must be right, but surely the Government should have tried to avoid disappointing the proper and rightful expectations of policyholders by such arbitrary action or by changing the taxation system in the way that they propose. Does the Financial Secretary admit that companies
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
with much unity business but with no investment reserve are being unfairly treated? If so, can something be done to ameliorate any unfairness? For example, a limit could be imposed on the amount of the investment: I realise that an open-ended commitment could lead to a loss of revenue, but surely something could be done to ameliorate the worst aspects of the changes that were brought in on Budget day and that gave companies no time in which to make changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is not an easy matter and giving companies a year in which to make changes may not be the answer because a great deal of revenue would escape, but perhaps there is a half-way house. Have the Minister's advisers considered that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's comments, but I do not think that there is a way to ameliorate the effect of the changes. The subject is complex enough without bringing in half-way houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would provide an easy way for companies to forestall, and to avoid on a huge scale, the tax changes that we consider fair and right to introduce. He seems to think that the changes will affect policyholders, but they concern only trading profits and not policyholders. That is true of the first part of the clauses with which we are dealing. I do not find the hon. Gentleman's argument persuasive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, the changes will affect policyholders. However, in view of the Financial Secretary's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>7.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw one or two points to the attention of the Financial Secretary. First, the effect of clause 78(1)(b) is that reservations of annuity profits can be made only out of the unallocated surplus and must relate to the "reasonable expectations" of with-profit policyholders on bonuses. The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if, at the end of the period, the company has an unappropriated surplus on valuation, as shown in its return for the purposes of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, then, subject to subsection (3) below, the closing liabilities of the period may include such amount, forming part of that surplus, as is required to meet the reasonable expectations of policyholders or annuitants with regard to bonuses or other additions to benefit of a discretionary nature."</p></blockquote>
There is no definition of a reasonable bonus expectation. My view, as a policyholder, is that the bigger the bonus, the better. The terminology is difficult. The provision refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable expectations of policy holders".</p></blockquote>
I foresee many arguments between life offices and tax inspectors and I question whether this is a good way to enjoy tax inspectors. Her Majesty's Government do not have too many of them because their financial rewards in the private sector are so much greater than they are in the Civil Service. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
tax inspectors are to be employed in this way, they should be used properly and unless we know what a reasonable expectation of a bonus is we cannot do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it seems that it will no longer be possible to make a reservation of annuity profits to support the EEC solvency margins. The solvency margin is a statutory necessity. Does the Financial Secretary expect offices to stand on their own feet and provide the money—I understood him to say that the concession was unwarranted—or does the Revenue need the money, or is the purpose to keep down the money supply figures? I hope that the Financial Secretary can comment on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new relief for unappropriated surplus is narrowly drawn because it is only in exceptional cases that policyholders have reasonable expectations of benefit that are not already reflected in mathematical reserves set up by the company. As to the reasonable expectations test, no better one was suggested during the extensive consultations. The Revenue expects to be guided in its application by the same considerations to which the regulatory authorities have regard in interpreting the concept for their own purposes. There is every intention that the Revenue should keep in step with the interpretation that holds for regulatory purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about relief for solvency margins. Life companies are required to maintain a minimum surplus of assets over liabilities, the precise amount of the margin being determined by set formulae. The solvency margin requirement is essentially a capital requirement that new companies, and indeed more mature companies that find themselves in difficulties, have to put up fresh capital to meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no presumption that the matter should feature in the calculation of taxable profits. Indeed, the effect of a relief for the solvency margin would be to worsen the relative position of new or loss-making companies as against that of established and profitable ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my introductory remarks I outlined the effect of clause 78. If the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) will bear with me, I should like to take this opportunity, now that we have got down to the important nitty gritty detail, to set out the purpose of this series of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that we embarked on a consultation and published a document. Responses showed a broad consensus on the views set out in detail by the Association of British Insurers, and acknowledged important defects in the current rules, but argued that they could be dealt with adequately without the upheaval of introducing fundamentally new regimes. The consultative document contained recommendations, some of which were more radical than others. We looked through the policyholders to individual investors and wondered whether to continue with or to reform the income minus expenses basis of taxation. We decided to reform it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This years' proposals amend a special tax regime that goes back for decades. Throughout this period the background has been the special way in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
the industry operates. Life assurance business is written out of an "undivided fund" that combines the interests of all the policyholders, and shareholders too, where there are any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fund takes in premiums and earnings from the fund's investments; pays out expenses, pays benefits to policyholders and transfers of profit to the shareholders; and holds reserves against the obligation to pay future policy benefits. The figures for those various amounts are all relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two consequences flow from the way that the fund operates, and shape the tax rules. First, there is only one charge to tax—corporation tax, paid by the life office—on the profits, income and gains of the office and its policyholders that are derived from the fund. Policyholders in the main have no further tax to pay on the policy benefits received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a single fund commonly brings together different classes of business that have to be given a different tax treatment. For example, pension business is taxable only on its trading profits, as investment returns earned for policy holders enjoy the tax exemption for approved pension provision. In life assurance, in the everyday sense of the term "basic life assurance business", the investment returns to policyholders are quite properly taxable, as they are for personal savings generally. That is why we have the unique system known as I minus E which brings together contributions from different classes of business calculated according to rules specific to each; the investment income and gains, less expenses, of basic life business, and the trading profits of pension business. The upshot is that both the profits of the office, and the net returns earned for basic life policyholders, are fully taxed. Clause 78 and other proposals would retain that basic structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules have developed piecemeal over the years and are now flawed by weaknesses that have undermined the performance of the regime and distorted the incidence of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objective in the Budget was to provide a tax regime that is more efficient and more equitable. At present, the regime falls unevenly between taxation of life assurance and other forms of saving and between different companies within the life assurance business. We had to take account of the special nature of life assurance—it is a blend of protection and savings, and we wanted a simple system. That is why we put forward our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is to tax pensions and general annuity business on a proper basis by stopping expenses of this business spilling over to reduce the tax due from basic life business. That is ring-fencing the different activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we propose to broaden the tax base and spread the tax relief for basic life acquisition expenses, which we shall discuss in clause 82. At the same time, to achieve a balance, we have introduced ring-fencing and limited acquisition expenses, which is to be phased in over seven years. We have also reduced the tax rate on gains and income to the basic rate of income tax—25 per cent. Thirdly, we have abolished life assurance policy duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first batch of three measures—putting pension and general annuity profits on the right footing—all,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
in a way, involve bringing the profit calculation on to a basis more consistent with the one that the offices use in the accounts that they draw up for themselves and include in their statutory returns to the Department of Trade and Industry. The most important of those proposals—"ring-fencing" expenses—puts back into the profit calculation an ingredient, the trading expenses of the business, which currently does not appear there at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two involve correcting ingredients that already appear in the calculation, but in amounts that may be quite different from those which the offices use for their own purposes—the contributions on the plus side for investment earnings, which are dealt with in clause 79, and on the minus side for amounts set out aside to cover obligations to policyholders. Clause 78 starts off by tackling that deduction for reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for that lengthy outline, but it is important to put the clause into context, so that we know what we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for making that statement before we delve into the details of the clause. The problem is that it is getting late, and a balance must be struck between doing justice to clauses so that they are examined properly and the fact that many members of the Committee want to pack up well before midnight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not dissent from the thrust of the clause. Ring-fencing the life business from the annuity and pensions business is a good thing and will provide clarity and transparency. Again, a balance must be struck as regards other advantages that are being given. The definition of business acquisition is rather wide, and future amendments will seek to narrow it. Moreover, the spread of seven years does not seem right, especially as it involves a dip in the amount of relief that companies can get before the transitional period expires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return later to the fact that we do not want to waste tax inspectors' time trying to sort out boundary lines such as what is a new business acquisition or what is a reasonable bonus expectation. That principal theme will run throughout the Bill. I am glad that the Financial Secretary implied that he does not foresee any more time being spent by tax inspectors under this regime on determining reasonable bonus expectations. Under those circumstances, we shall not press the clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In subsection (1), computation of annuity profits, or realising profits through unit shares, which is the present system, is replaced by the annuity share of the appreciation, whether it is realised or not, as brought into the revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no problem with that, but problems will arise with the amount of the apportionment of profits between the various aspects of any business, be it pensions, annuity or life assurance. Again, the Bill says nothing about how the apportionment will be made. It may be reasonable to apportion the annuity share of transfer from the investment of the revenue account, according to the cost of bonuses; on the other hand, it may be done according to the total actuarial liabilities. Which of those methods does the Financial Secretary propose?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem is coupled with the fact that we do not want tax inspectors to waste time arguing with accountants in life offices about how each apportionment should be made. That is a serious problem because if the apportionment is made according to actuarial liabilities, the amount attributed to annuity business could be much larger than otherwise, and the tax paid on annuity profits would be much increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, expenses would have to be split between life and annuity business. We have no problem with that: it must be done to avoid life assurance expenses being relieved against annuity profits, and vice versa. Again, the Bill does not say how that will be done. It could be done according to actuarial liabilities, but that would be unfair in circumstances such as those outlined earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is intended to ensure that the profits on which life companies are charged to tax are based on the figures that they show in their accounts and statutory returns. The object is to ensure that there is proper matching between the deductible bonus allocations and liabilities to policy holders, on the one hand, and the incomings which fund those liabilities on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for change arises because of uncertainty in the operation of the current rules. Life offices do not have to produce a profit and loss account, so that the usual starting point for calculating tax liabilities

is not available. Instead, their returns under the Insurance Companies Act 1982 form the starting point for calculating the trading profit for tax purposes. This is a satisfactory alternative, provided that all the incomings and outgoings which go into their returns in any year are taken into account on a consistent basis. In practice, however, they may not be in every case. The main effect of the clause is to ensure that taxable incomings and deductible liabilities follow the figures in offices' own accounts, thus ensuring internal consistency and a proper balance between the debits and credits.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would remedy the unsatisfactory aspects of the clause. What exactly are acquisition expenses? The most offending part of the clause is the term, "commissions (however described)." That would have a restricting effect upon life offices. For example, commissions for reassurance contracts would suffer a spread even though no one would call them new or acquisition business. They are part of the normal run of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Home service agents call on policyholders each month to collect cash. Those agents do not get new business every time they go to a house to collect cash. It could be held that it is new business if the policyholder makes the policy paid-up or not paid, but in practice the collection of cash once a month from policyholders is not new business or the acquisition of business.

Could the Financial Secretary find a way to exclude home service agents from the net? Those agents are usually—unless they are intermediaries—on the salary roll of a life office or company and as such are a continuing expense. While I admit that, when the transitional provisions have worked themselves through, the situation might be more or less on a level playing field, a company might be growing and in a period of growth it might acquire more home service agents and would not receive the right amount of relief. Even if the company were not growing or declining, inflation is always with us, irrespective of what the Government and the Chancellor do—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but there is a growing volume of chatter. If hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that even if a company were not growing or declining, inflation is always with us, so there would be an element of unfairness even after the transitional provisions have worked themselves through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Renewal expenses are a slightly different matter, but they are clearly not acquisition expenses. I understand that problems would be created if the Government allowed renewal expenses to escape the spread. Companies may write down as renewal expenses items that are not. The Government want a watertight and straight provision. I understand that, but if they will not allow renewal expenses to escape the spread of relief, I want to place emphasis on home service agents, who are in a different position because a life office or company cannot indulge in avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the amendments would delete the word "solely" in subsection (1)(b). There should be comparability of treatment between different life offices. Some companies pay intermediaries and others pay their own sales staff. Sales staff may have functions that are not solely concerned with the acquisition of business, and such a sales force would be caught in the net and not intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is advertising part of an acquisition? None of us wants tax inspectors to spend their time on such matters; they have far more important things to do. Does advertising create a disposition to buy or is it aimed at advertising a particular name? The Bill does not answer questions about compound advertising and about housing contents and life insurance combined. There may be many managers in life offices who spend much time analysing new or renewal business. Is that maintenance and, therefore, allowable for relief immediately or is it part of new business, the relief for which has to be spread over seven years? Much is left unanswered by the Bill and I hope that the Minister will enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman and wish to look further into his other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
The hon. Gentleman knows that the spreading of relief for acquisition expenses introduced by clause 82 is an important part of the package. It is arguably at the heart of the package. It is important that it should start from an accurate and workable rule for identifying acquisition expenses as the hon. Gentleman said. The rules should give a fully realistic measure of the industry's selling costs. The base-broadening that clause 82 introduces helps to pay for the substantial tax cuts elsewhere, to which I referred on the last clause stand part debate. We have a deep cut in the policyholder tax rate—both incomes and gains—and complete abolition of the stamp duty on life policies. If the overall package is to be balanced, clause 82 has to be effective. It is equally important that the rules should aim to apply consistently to the different methods of distribution used by different offices, from direct sales to sales through independent brokers. And it should equally be consistent, so far as possible, to the wide range of different expenses that are likely to be incurred as part of a company's overall selling effort, the mix of which will no doubt vary from office to office and over time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded that the amendments will improve the Bill's performance in those respects—the contrary is more likely. The approach in the Bill aims to base the treatment of expenses firmly on the facts of each case. Expenses that are laid out solely to bring in business are treated as 100 per cent. acquisition expenses. That is fair enough and likely to apply without much controversy to a good proportion of the total costs in question. Costs that are laid out partly to bring in business and partly for other purposes will be split accordingly. Again it is easy enough to see why a provision on those lines is needed if the rules are to deal fairly with different channels of distribution and the different ways that companies may choose to organise their selling efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, I referred to independent brokers. The major part of the selling effort, including the indirect and overhead costs of keeping it going, is in the hands of a third party, the broker. If the commissions paid by the office to finance that are to count as acquisition expenses, as clearly they must, then it is necessary for the rules to include a comprehensive measure of costs, including indirect costs and overheads, in those other cases where offices handle their selling effort in-house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the rules in the Bill will be difficult, or too uncertain to operate. Such fears are exaggerated. There will no doubt be some teething problems as the new rules bed down in paractice, but the process, and the issues of costs allocation that the clause will throw up, are not new for this sort of business and I am sure that the new rules will be working smoothly soon enough. The Revenue is, of course, always available and ready to discuss matters with representatives of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham referred to renewal commissions. I cannot see why renewal commissions should not be treated as acquisition expenses because that is what they are. But the hon. Gentleman may be right about the industrial branch of home service business. I am prepared to consider his point, but give no commitment.

The proposals are not unfair to reassurance commissions but we shall consider that possibility in our proposals for reassurance. The hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments remedy a defect in the spread of reliefs. The Bill proposes that the reliefs should be spread over seven years, but that would mean that in the transitional provisions, certainly for some life offices, there would be a dip in the percentage of deductible tax. I am sure that hon. Members have received representations about that. A scheme could have been devised to avoid that dip in the middle years of the transitional period. The amendments seek to do that and to front-load the relief, which is a reasonable measure because most acquisition costs occur in the first two years of a business. One may receive commission in the first year and some may be held back for the second year, but the majority of it is received in two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's view that the proposals form a package in which some things are given and others taken away. The downside of the deal is that, instead of relief being spread over two years, it is spread over seven, but we should be able to fine tune it a little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to avoid the dip and to front-load the relief. An intermediary who acquires business will have to pay tax straight away, so relief should be given early to the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave the answer to his own amendments in the second part of his speech. The package is balanced. I referred to tax reductions made on gains income and life assurance policy duty. In 1990–91 the acquisition costs measures and rate reductions will cost £30 million. The hon. Gentleman is right that the cost builds up in the long term, but he knows that the spreading of acquisition costs is being phased. Heavily front-ending the relief, as he proposes, would effectively destroy the package. The acquisition costs are the most important part of the package for a proper balance between the treatment of life assurance and other forms of saving and the incidence of tax between offices. The use of acquisition expenses has enabled some companies not to pay any tax. Our view is that the treatment of acquisition expenses is anomalous when we consider the treatment of expenses in other forms of saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would shift the effect of the clause a long way back to the immediate relief allowed by current law. Almost half the present acquisition expenses would be allowed immediately and that would amount to nearly two thirds by the following year. Just over one third of the total would remain to be spread over the remaining five years. As the amendment moves back to affect the current law, it would reintroduce precisely those weaknesses that the package has been designed to prevent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say what costs would result from accepting the amendment. It would be a very long time before the change began to have an impact—not until the turn of the century. However, the amendment would undermine the thrust of our carefully constructed and balanced package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with what the Financial Secretary has said.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first change made by the first of the two new subsections proposed by amendment No. 289 deals with an exceptional circumstance where the formulae as they stand simply would not work. As a general rule, both A and B in the formulae will be positive. Where either one is not, the clause stipulates that it should be treated as zero. Where, exceptionally, both A and B were set to zero by this rule, all the figures in both functions would be zeros and the clause would make no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a situation is unlikely to happen often, but we have been persuaded by representations that it should be catered for and is possible. The amendment introduces a simple rule in such cases that the whole tax base should be treated as belonging to shareholders. That reflects the view that normal corporation tax rates, rather than the reduced policyholder rate, should apply unless the figures show that some positive investment return is accruing to policyholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second subsection introduced by amendment No. 289 makes it clear how the formulae apply to mutual business. Since there are no shareholders participating in the profits of such business, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
appropriate results—as the amendment provides—is that the shareholders' share should be nil, and the whole tax base should be eligible for the reduced tax rate available to policyholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 290 introduces an improvement to the definition of B in the formulae.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the amendment with regard to mutuality and I welcome the proposition of clearing up that point. However, there is a problem. When the Finance Bill was drafted with the fractions A/A+B and B/A+B it clearly did not occur to anybody that when A and B are both zero, the fractions are undefined. That leads me to suspect that those functions might have been thought up somewhat hastily. If that is right, the fractions may still not be as they should. Opposition Members have received representations on the matter, and I am sure that the Financial Secretary has, too. If he discovers between now and Report a further flaw, inaccuracy or unfairness in the formulae and is persuaded that the measure needs further refinement, I hope that he will not hesitate to table a further amendment on Report. We want the provision to be right, and we are a little worried that it is being prepared in too much haste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with options. After Budget day, any exercise of options on policies will be looked at as a variation and there will be a new charge to tax. That seems a little harsh. It is not a major point on which we should spend a long time, but if there were options in a policy which were expected by the policyholder when the contract was made and which the policyholder could exercise without causing too serious a loss of revenue for the Treasury, I should have thought that an exception could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in a 10-year endowment policy, there could have been an option to extend it for three years without a medical. That is hardly something that the Treasury needs to ban under the Bill. There could be a term assurance contract with an option to convert it into an endowment contract under certain circumstances and for certain lengths of time. I should have thought that it would not be too difficult for the Treasury to make limited allowances for certain options without the new regime being brought into play immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by the amendment. The clause follows past practice when changes have been made to the tax treatment of life assurance benefits in the hands of the policy holder. As the hon. Gentleman said, the position is that policies taken out before Budget day are protected from any charge under schedule 9, but only as long as nothing is done after Budget day to increase the benefits or extend the term. The hon. Gentleman's proposal would greatly extend the scope of that protection by excluding pre-Budget policies from the charge even if the benefits are increased or the term extended, as long as that is done under the exercise of rights under the policy. I do not think that there is any justification for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies holding pre-Budget policies will enjoy complete and open-ended protection from any charge under the schedule as long as they leave the policies to run their course. That will give the companies concerned a useful windfall benefit. From 1990, they will benefit from the reduced policyholder tax rate, introduced under clause 84, equal to the basic rate of income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in the past, we believe that it is fair to give this protection to existing policies, but it is quite another matter to allow companies to take steps after Budget day that increase the value of their pre-Budget policies. The cost of the loophole cannot be quantified, but it could be extremely large and I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman would wish for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any detail about deep discount securities can be discussed under schedule 10, but it seems right to say a word or two about the principles here. The existing law provides that on corporate deep discount securities with no variable features, the discount as it accrues over the life of the bond is taxed as income rather than capital. However, there are certain other non-variable deep discount bonds, especially those relating to those issued by public authorities abroad, where the income can be taxed as capital gain rather than income. The Government are attempting to close that loophole by means of the clause and the attached schedule. We welcome that. It is still possible in this country to shift income between income that is liable for income tax and income that is liable for capital gains tax so as to gain tax advantage. This clause and schedule remove one possible such mechanism and we welcome that. I notice from the Red Book that, in the 1991 financial year, the estimated additional income to the Exchequer from this change is £15 million. That will be useful income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) and myself is to rectify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One institution has a security that provides a return to holders equal to that provided by a portfolio, which from time to time matches exactly the composition of the FT index. Interest is paid quarterly at a rate equal to and fluctuating with the dividend yield on the index. On redemption, the stock will carry a premium or discount equal to the change in the index from the date of the issue of the stock to the date of redemption. That redemption may be at a premium greater than 15 per cent. That creates a problem under the qualifying terms of indexed securities, and the aim of the amendments is to ask the Government to reconsider the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Arbuthnot) for raising such an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
important issue. The amendments relate to the taxation of indexed bonds. Those bonds are a type of variable bond. We have nevertheless decided that, in certain circumstances, the return on indexed bonds will not be taxed in the same way as the return on other variable bonds covered by schedule 11. Those circumstances are where the form of index-linking is such as to give the lender protection against long-term price inflation. So sterling bonds that are linked to the UK retail price index, and foreign currency bonds that are linked to a similar general price index in the country in whose currency the bond is denominated, will not come within the new provisions, provided that they are issued for a period of five years or more. That means that the capital uplift on such bonds will not in general be taxable as income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to relax the conditions relating to the exemption that have allowed, so as to exclude from schedule 11 bonds that are linked to a stock exchange index of equity values. I sypmathise with their aim. However, I want to examine the technical drafting of the amendments. I also want to consider what is the right way of taxing that type of bond for the future. We shall therefore, consult interested parties on the proper way to tax bonds linked to equity indices for issues made after today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also recognise that there are some existing bonds of that nature. It would not be right to leave holders of those bonds in a state of uncertainty while we consult on a longer-term solution. I am glad to be able to announce that we shall introduce legislation on Report to remove from the scope of schedule 11 existing bonds that are linked to an equity index on a recognised stock exchange and that are themselves quoted on such an exchange.

	<br><blockquote><p>"except that this condition shall not be treated as fulfilled if the territory in question would fall to be regarded as subject to a lower level of taxation for the purposes of s750 of the Taxes Act 1988".</p></blockquote>
This amendment is about the definition of a qualified indexed security, which does not suffer the more rigorous tax treatment provided for deep gain securities in the schedule. To be a qualified indexed security, certain conditions must be fulfilled. In particular, for a non-sterling security, the redemption amount must be referrable to a general index of prices published by the Government of the territory and in whose currency the security is denominated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted to launch into a close analysis of the different structures of retail price indices, as compiled in various industrialised countries, and, in particular, to highlight the element of housing costs that exist in all such indices and the fallacy of trying to excise

from the British index the amount for mortgage interest payments. However, I shall forgo that opportunity, tempting as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to restrict the fulfilment of the condition that the index should be identifiable against a general index of prices so that it is not permitted in low-tax territories. The definition relates to other parts of taxation legislation. We tabled the amendment because we do not wish to offer any favourable regime to securities issued by tax havens and equivalent territories.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unsure about what the amendment seeks to achieve. It should be made clear that the provision in the schedule applies to bonds that relate to a retail price index issued by Governments and in the currency of their countries and not only to bonds issued by the Governments of the countries involved. The bonds could be issued by a British company, or another nationality of company, in relation to a price index in a territory that has a low rate of tax. That low rate of tax does not apply to the bond involved. We are concerned with the British rate of tax applying to British investors in such securities. There is no reason to disciminate against bonds that are denominated in that way and relate to indices of such territories. The hon. Gentleman can be assured that the tax avoidance provisions that are built into the legislation are sufficient to cope with any problems that might arise in the sort of territories that he does not favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment touches on the calculation of the tax charge which arises, and refers particularly to non-sterling securities. Where the calculation of the amount attained on the transfer of the security exceeding the amount paid on acquisition occurs with a non-sterling security, it is necessary to translate acquisition and transfer amounts into sterling at the relevant exchange date's ruling at those two dates. Someone could make a gain when measured in the currency of issue, but not make a gain when the acquisition and disposal amounts were translated into sterling at their respective dates.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As clause 91 is intimately related to clauses 90 and 89, I shall clarify the purpose of those clauses and the issues to which they give rise. Where bonds are issued at a discount to redemption price, the discount is an alternative to interest and a compensation for a low coupon. It is appropriate that it should be taxed as income when realised. That is easy enough for bonds where the redemption date and terms are certain—commonly known as deep-discount bonds—and clause 89 achieves that, but not where the date, terms and actuality of redemption are uncertain, because it is impossible to assess how the benefits from that potential gain on redemption will accrue over the life of the bond. It has been necessary to classify such bonds as deep-gain bonds and treat them differently, as in clause 90. Clause 91 deals specifically with gilt-edged securities. A problem arises for convertible bonds. Where bonds have variable features—there is an increasing variety of such issues both by public and corporate bodies in the United Kingdom and overseas—it is only possible to split the income and capital elements when the bond has matured. The split could be applied to the investor who purchased the bond at the date of issue and held it to maturity. But that provides no solution for intermediate buyers and sellers. With many of these bonds the uplift realised by investors is to a large extent simply compensation for a low coupon and it is clearly wrong that it should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
be regarded as capital. These proposed deep-gain rules in clause 90 and schedule 11, therefore, charge the uplift as income. Issuers can avoid this consequence by tailoring their bonds to fit the rules in clause 89.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In attempting to provide this certain tax regime covering all variable bonds we recognise that in one or two respects the net has been cast too wide and embraces certain bonds where the increase in value of the bonds wholly or mainly relates to a link to equity values rather than the conversion of interest income into capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main category concerned is bonds convertible into equities. Let me immediately reassure hon. Members that convertible bonds which simply carry a right to conversion, whether to equities or other sorts of securities, with no options to redeem at a premium, are outside this legislation. But, as drafted, the legislation covers convertible bonds with options to redeeem at a premium. Call options can only be exercised by the issuer, and put options can only be exercised by the investor. Convertible bonds can have either or both of those options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have concluded that it would be right to exclude from the legislation all bonds—not only convertibles but some straight bonds—where the only reason that they are treated as deep-gain securities is that the issuer has the option to redeem them at a premium. If the issuer only has an option and is not obliged to exercise it in the investor's favour, the premium cannot be relied on as part of the return on the investor's money and so it is reasonable to tax it as capital gain, not income. That change means that all existing and future bonds that would otherwise be caught simply because of the existence of an issuer's option will not be treated as deep-gain securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it is the investor who has the option the situation is more complex. In that situation, the premium provides the investor with a guaranteed profit and compensates for a low coupon on the bond. That should be taxed as income. However, some gains on such securities will clearly relate much more to fluctuations in the value of the underlying equity and be much less appropriate to be taxed as income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have concluded that, in consulation with interested parties, we must examine in greater depth the correct treatment of increases in value realised on convertible bonds. The intention would be to devise equitable arrangements under which income converted into guaranteed or near guaranteed premiums would be charged to income tax while leaving gains akin to those on equities charged to capital gains tax. We will commence these consultations immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise, however, that investors need to know where they stand in relation to existing quoted convertibles with investors' options. We shall also introduce an amendment on Report excluding from clause 90 all quoted convertible bonds or bonds convertible into quoted equities issued up to today, leaving them to be taxed under the existing regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said in reply to the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
intend also to remove from the scope of the legislation existing issues of bonds that are linked to an index of equity values on a recognised stock exchange and are themselves quoted on such an exchange. We shall also consult on how to tax such bonds issued after today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that this will meet the genuine concerns that have been expressed. Reforms are necessary and I am confident that representative bodies will co-operate fully in efforts to achieve a fair and workable system for future issues of convertible and indexed bonds. I am grateful to you, Mr. Crowther, for allowing me to deal with issues that arose on the two preceeding clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the anti-avoidance provision in clause 94 that is aimed at restricting the abuse of the ACT set-off rules. I wish the Financial Secretary to consider especially amendment No. 384, which seeks to introduce a further test that must be satisfied before the surrendered Act can be utilised. At present the restriction on use of the ACT is imposed under the clause if the surrendering company has undergone a change of ownership and a major change in the nature or conduct of its trade. Our amendment requires that prohibition extends to circumstances where the surrendering company has changed ownership and, even though it may not have undergone a major change in the nature or conduct of the trade, its activities have become
	<br><blockquote><p>"small or negligible and before a considerable revival…there is a change of ownership".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
In those circumstances we ask the Financial Secretary carefully to consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with one company selling ACT to another. That can be done in several ways but sophisticated devices can be used. The company with surplus ACT could have a subsidiary company to which it surrenders the surplus ACT. When the company is sold to the new group the subsidiary goes with it and the existing anti-avoidance provision will not bite unless there is a major change in the business of the subsidiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 245A prevents that by causing the ACT surrendered to the subsidiary to be lost if there is a major change in the business of the surrendering company. So that avoidance device will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to widen the scope of the new anti-avoidance provision. It would apply not only if there had been a major change in the surrendering company's business, but if its business became small or negligible before the change of ownership and revived considerably after the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the amendment is based on the existing anti-avoidance provision in section 245 of the Taxes Act 1988. This deals with the case where a company with surplus ACT has become largely dormant before the change of ownership and its business revives subsequently. The point of the provision is that the company may have become dormant more than three years before the change of ownership so there would not have been a major change in the company's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
business within the specified three-year period. In other words, it is dealing not with artificial tax avoidance schemes but simply with cases where a company which happens to have surplus ACT is sold to another company which intends to revive the company in order to generate profits and absorb the ACT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not the same need for such a provision. In practice it would add nothing to what would be done by clause 94. However, I shall give more thought to the point and if I can think of any circumstances in which such an amendment would strengthen the provision and conclude that it would serve a purpose, I shall table an appropriate amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
