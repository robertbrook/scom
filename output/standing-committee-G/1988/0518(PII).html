<p>8.30 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 122, with which we shall also consider amendments Nos. 123, 124, 126 and 127.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to move these amendments, Mr. Crowther.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case we shall press on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 163, line 46, leave out sub-paragraph (d).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall also consider the following amendments: No. 128, in page 164, line 18, leave out sub-paragraph (e).<br><br>
No. 129, in page 164, line 42, leave out sub-paragraph (ii).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments deal with planning permission and with the temporary provisions that will operate before the new regime comes into force.<br><br>
Paragraph 12(2)(d) contains the condition that
<br><blockquote><p>"planning permission for the construction (or reconstruction) of the building was granted before 21st June 1988."</p></blockquote>
I should not object to that condition if planning permission were the sole criterion, but "planning permission" is easier to say than to define. Does it here refer to outline permission, to full planning permission or to the inclusion of reserved matters? A briefing note from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which I suspect has been sent to every member of the Committee, says that sometimes planning permission is not necessary, although I cannot think of any examples.<br><br>
A developer would be silly to sign an irrevocable undertaking to carry on with a development or to construct a building if planning permission had not yet been given. Conversely, a developer may have entered into a commitment to construct on condition that planning permission is obtained. Then, if planning permission was not obtained until after 21 June 1988, the developer would be at a disadvantage.<br><br>
I hope that the sense of fair play on the Government Back Benches will come to my support on the amendment. So far only the odd Conservative Back-Bench Member has supported us. Many of them are very quiet this evening and say nothing. My
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
argument is easily understood and I wish to hear what the Economic Secretary has to say about it.<br><br>
The RICS briefing says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraph 11 deals with transitional arrangements. Various categories of contracts and other binding obligations will continue to enjoy the benefit of zero-rating if various criteria are satisfied one of which (2)(d) is that 'planning permission for the construction of the building was granted before 21st June 1988.'"</p></blockquote>
The provision applies only to the transitional arrangements.<br><br>
The briefing continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are, of course, certain types of development which do not require explicit planning permission."</p></blockquote>
I cannot think of any, but perhaps my hon. Friends can. Presumably the briefing is accurate. The RICS goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is important, therefore, that 11(2)(d)"—the RICS must mean paragraph 12(2)(d)—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"should be amended to read:… 'planning permission for the construction of the building, <i>where required,</i> was granted before 21st June 1988.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Planning permission should be treated as granted where it can be shown that all necessary approvals had been given even though the actual letter confirming approval had not been issued."</p></blockquote>
The Economic Secretary should explain how the Government intend to deal with those two important issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first question asked by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) was about the kind of planning permission that is involved. It would include outline or provisional planning permission, as long as it was granted before 21 June 1988, and it clearly defines the number, size and design of buildings or civil engineering works involved. I shall explain the reasons for this form of transitional relief.<br><br>
We set out, above all, to provide relief for those who were legally committed to construct buildings before the court's ruling on 21 June last year. We accept that there could be difficulties, even though the industry, by and large, knew that the ruling was on the cards and that the Advocate General's outline view was made known before that date. There could be difficulties for those who had entered into such a commitment and found that they had to go ahead but had to bear 15 per cent. VAT. We did not provide relief. We therefore exempted contracts made before that date. We put in the additional provision relating to planning permission, because otherwise there would be no limit on the extent of the relief. It would be possible for people to build extra buildings on the site, or to cram them in and take advantage of the relief—something that we did not find acceptable. If a developer did not have planning permission, or merely had a legal contract that was conditional on his obtaining planning permission later, he could not be said to be unconditionally or irrevocably committed to going ahead. Thus he would not be in the category of people whom we seek primarily to help—those who could not back out of contracts and had to go ahead and bear the 15 per cent.<br><br>
Those reasons for introducing the planning permission condition as well as the legal commitment have been largely understood, and although obviously people prefer to have as few conditions as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
possible and to have transitional reliefs that are as long and extensive as possible, they recognise that we have gone out of our way to meet the transitional problems of the construction industry, and in our view, that is the best way to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had no representations from developers who are suffering by reason of the clause, but it still does not seem right that the contract could have been signed before 21 June 1988, subject to planning permission. Planning permission could have been with the local authority and not granted perhaps until 1 July 1988, so there is, perhaps, a little unfairness. But having had no representations on the matter, it cannot be a serious problem for the building industry, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With that we shall also take amendment No. 162, in page 164, line 49, at end, insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8)(a) a person is to be treated as under a legally binding obligation incurred before 21st June 1988 if any person with whom he is associated at the time of making the relevant supply was under such an obligation;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) one person is associated with another at any time if at that time both are bodies corporate and are eligible to be treated as members of a group under Section 29(3) of the Value Added Tax Act 1983.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I move the amendments on behalf of the Social and Liberal Democratic party. They stand in the names of the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) and the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace). As we were told at our previous sitting, the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, has suffered the bereavement of a close relative and is unable to be here. The hon. Member for Fife, North-East has a longstanding constituency commitment and is also unable to be here. Minority parties suffer if they have only two members available because it is more difficult for them to fill in.<br><br>
As a member of the official Opposition, I shall not comment on the amendment, but merely read the gist of the hon. Gentleman's argument. The Labour party always obliges, as it is a helpful party.<br><br>
In multi-phase and major developments, a developer will undoubtedly incur substantial expenditure on a range of matters before the purchase of a site, for example, land identification and site assembly, design and planning, infrastructure works such as the provision of services, diversion of roads and site clearance. In particular, building work will frequently progress under head of terms, letter of intent or a similar understanding or arrangement that falls short of a binding document. Formal building contracts are complex documents and are frequently not finalised until well after the construction work has begun.<br><br>
A developer may not employ one contractor for the whole building project but may sub-contract for the various different services and materials required during the construction of the buildings. A complex inner-city development may involve literally hundreds of building contracts. A developer will clearly be committed long before he has signed all of them. Even when a developer employs one contractor for one phase in a multi-phase project, he will not usually place a building contract for later phases until early phases have been completed. A developer is no less committed to completing a project that he has already commenced simply because he has not signed a building contract for all the outstanding work.<br><br>
The SLD amendment would rectify that and clarify the Bill. As a member of the Opposition, I shall not comment on it because the SLD representatives are not here, but we may do so on Report. The intention is to ask the Economic Secretary to reply so that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
something is on the record and the matter can be raised at a later stage, if necessary.</span></p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be moved by that example of friendship and cooperation on the Opposition Benches. "No enemies to the centre" seems to be the new slogan. I was momentarily tempted by the uncharitable thought that the absence of SLD Members was perhaps because they were campaigning in Italy. I did not like to guess whether they might be campaigning for or against.<br><br>
The amendment reflects a view that was expressed to us by several developers. We recognised that we had to consider those arguments before the legislation was published. The question was whether we should go beyond a legal commitment to recognise something which they call an economic commitment. It would be without precedent to do so; moreover, it would extend in a wider, hard-to-define and even more difficult to justify way the relief which we have already made available and which should be quite adequate.<br><br>
Perhaps I may set out, without going into great detail, the extent of the reliefs that we have offered. There is always relief, whenever an extension of the VAT system is made, that is inherent in the system. In other words, if payment is made before the new extension of VAT comes into operation, that will be exempt from the new tax or, in this case, remain zero-rated. We know of payments of as much as £1½ billion that were made perfectly legally and properly. We advertised and made it known that the facility existed for those who were engaged in large development projects and wished to pay for them before the tax came into operation; they were not taxed. That is one relief which is available for those who were not protected by a legally binding contract and a planning permission. The legally binding contract ahead of the date of the judgment extends indefinitely to the completion of that contract; subsequent ones, together with planning permission, would last for five years. That is a major and far-reaching protection.<br><br>
Built into the tax is the option to tax, which means that no one will bear the burden of taxation unless he or his tenants are in the exempt, usually the financial, sector. Many developers seem to think that all their potential tenants will be wholly exempt. That is extremely unlikely. As far as we know, there are approximately 15,000 partially exempt and 30,000 wholly exempt companies out of 1.6 million companies trading in this country. It is unlikely that any development, except in specialised financial spheres, would be wholly dependent on financial tenants who were unable to pass on or reclaim the VAT on rents if their landlord opted to tax to reclaim the cost of VAT on construction.<br><br>
For those reasons, it would not be appropriate for the Committee to accept a further extension of the transitional reliefs that we have already provided in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the SLD representatives are not here and with the hope that, if they so wish, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
matter can be raised again at a later stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

SEWERAGE SERVICES AND WATER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 12, line 28, after "are", insert "wholly or partly".</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment No. 80 is clear in its intention. Clause 18(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Group 2… of Schedule 5… to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 shall be amended as follows"</p></blockquote>
and clause 18(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In item 1, there shall be substituted for paragraph (b)—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(b) emptying of any cesspools, septic tanks or similar receptacles which are used otherwise than in connection with the carrying on in the course of a business of a relevant industrial activity.'"</p></blockquote>
There must be cesspools, septic tanks and similar receptacles that will be partly used for domestic or for qualifying purposes and for business activity. The measure provides for zero-rating for domestic tanks only if they are not used in connection with a business or an industrial activity.</p>
<p>There is no problem when such a receptacle is used only for domestic purposes. But a problem will arise when there is a mix. For that reason, the amendment suggests that the words "wholly or partly" should be added to the clause to make it read,
<br><blockquote><p>"emptying of any cesspools, septic tanks or similar receptacles which are wholly or partly used otherwise than in".</p></blockquote>
Thinking about that, I do not know whether it is equally deficient, but the amendment's intention is that if there is a small amount of business activity it should not prevent zero rating for the domestic activity. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will comment upon that.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "business activity". We think it is extremely unlikely that the circumstances for which the amendment is designed would exist. If a septic tank or the like is used by industry, as narrowly defined in subsection (4) for the manufacturing industry and similar industries, and shared with households, those households would be in the majority and they would win out. In other circumstances, if we were to try to retain zero rating where the major users of this facility were industries, we would infringe the European Court's ruling. Although we are unhappy about the measure, I cannot advise the Committee to amend the clause in this way.<br><br>
However, we should not worry too much if we cannot amend the clause because the circumstances that the amendment is designed to deal with are unlikely to arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that if domestic dwellings were in the majority they would

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
win out, but the words in the clause do not make that clear. We do not need to press the amendment to a Division, but there may be instances where this will happen. If I receive representations, or the Economic Secretary receives them, perhaps we can return to this on Report. Meanwhile, will the Economic Secretary ask his Department to ensure that no trouble will result from this?<br><br>
If that can be done—I see the Economic Secretary nodding his head—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

NEWS SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each member of the Committee will be aware of the controversy over value added tax and newspaper concerns. The item on news services has attracted no comments or representations. Perhaps the Minister will explain what "news services" means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. "News services" means organisations such as Reuters and the Prestel and Extel tapes that are available either on tapes such as those in the Corridor or on screens, and therefore differ from, and are distinguished from, newspapers, which are usually produced on paper. The main users of news services are newspapers and businesses and, as such, they will be able to reclaim VAT on news services. A few individuals subscribe to these services. The provision is in no way a precedent for the move that the hon. Gentleman suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "News services" is not a term with which I am familiar. I wonder whether the Bill contains a definition. The Economic Secretary has explained, but is there not a case for a much more explicit explanation of the meaning? If there is not, we are likely to have more controversy in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. "News services" is an incomplete definition to cover what the Economic Secretary spoke of. It could, for example, include news agencies in the classification. Many of us have those in our constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can enlighten the Committee by giving the definition in the VAT law. It is
<br><blockquote><p>"the supply to newspapers or to the public of information of the kind published in newspapers Note: This item does not include the supply of photographs."</p></blockquote>
Alternatively there is a broader definition in VAT leaflet 701/18/84, which is captioned:
<br><blockquote><p>"This leaflet explains the conditions under which the supply of information of a kind published in newspapers can be zero-rated."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
It was a category in VAT law which was previously zero-rated, but is now to be standard-rated. [Hon. Members: "What about agencies?"] I imagine that agencies would be covered, in the usual way, like the supply of services.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 13, line 28, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"on average over any accounting period".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 85, in page 13, line 40, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"on average over any accounting period".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment raises a question of clarity. It relates to the zero-rating of fuel and power not for domestic or charity use but as more of a de minimis provision for non-domestic and non-charity use where the amount that is used is small. Notes (1), (2)(c) and (2)(g) relating to group 7 of schedule 5 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 apply. I will speak to note (2)(g) because what applies to electricity applies to gas. Note (2)(g) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"a supply of electricity to a person at any premises where the electricity (together with any other electricity provided to him at the premises by the same supplier) was not provided at a rate exceeding 1,000 kilowatt hours a month."</p></blockquote>
If that means clearly that as soon as, in any one calendar month or in any one period of 31 days or whatever—I am not sure—more than 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity was supplied, it would no longer be a qualifying use, there will be no quibble about whether it is sufficiently high, or too high. We might have a quibble about the latter. There is non about clarity. The amendment seeks to add, on average, over an accounting period. How much may not be clear either. It also seeks clarity so that every person who is supplied with electricity or gas which qualifies as VAT-free knows where he stands. The words in notes (2)(c) and (2)(g) are not sufficiently clear.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the intention behind the amendment is that bills which cover a period other than one month should be eligible for zero-rating if on average the monthly consumption does not exceed 150 therms. That is also the intention behind the wording of the clause, and it has been accepted and agreed by the gas supply industry that the monthly limit will be pro-rated for invoices covering periods longer or shorter than one month.<br><br>
The present wording of the clause already achieves the effect desired by the hon. member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). While the amendment is not objectionable in principle, it is preferable to avoid using the term "accounting period", as it has a technical meaning for VAT-registered traders that

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
does not coincide with the period covered by a gas bill. We do not believe that the amendment would clarify, but might confuse the result that is already achieved by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 13, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"not intended for sale by the recipient".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 8, in page 13, line 33 leave out paragraph (e) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(e) a supply of petroleum gas in liquid state to any recipient with an installed tank capacity of not more than two tonnes suitable for storing such gas where the gas is not contained in a cylinder."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to begin my remarks on the amendment with the words, "Emboldened by my success in persuading my hon. Friend of the reason of my earlier amendment," but as the doctrine of flexible response has not yet reached the Treasury from across the road in the Ministry of Defence, I cannot, regrettably, do so.<br><br>
I assure my hon. Friend the Minister that amendment No. 9 is even more reasonable, and that on this occasion he should find it easier to accede to my wishes. Clause 20 deals with fuel and power, and my amendments refer to zero-rating of supplies of liquiefied petroleum gas—propane and butane. The clause, like the others that we have been debating, follows from the infamous decision of the European Court that compels us to change the rules on zero-rating. We still have a certain competence to zero rate supplies that would otherwise be standard rated where they are for domestic or charity use. In general, they are goods and services that are essential as the basis of daily life, as fuel and power certainly are. There are areas that are dependent upon liquiefied petroleum gases for light, heat, cooking and so on.<br><br>
The problem that we face—it is one that the Treasury has had to find ways round—is that liquiefied petroleum gases have both commercial and domestic uses. It is difficult to find a foolproof system, so that zero-rated supplies do not drift into uses for which they should be standard rated, that is, commercial uses.<br><br>
The Bill proposes that zero rates shall apply to LPGs in cylinders, where they are supplied directly to the final consumer. If the LPG producers sold direct to the consumers, no VAT would be leviable. If, however, supplies are sold to dealers and stockists—middlemen—in certain circumstances standard rates of VAT will apply.<br><br>
There is a different regime for bulk supplies of LPGs delivered by tankers. Note (2)(e) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"a supply of not more than 2,500 litres of petroleum gas in a liquid state"</p></blockquote>
will not be subject to VAT. I understand the Treasury's aim, which is to restrict zero-rating to domestic consumers. Nobody objects to commercial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
consumers having to pay VAT because, in almost every case, they are able to reclaim it through the usual input-output mechanism.<br><br>
The Government had to make a choice. They could either zero rate supplies and risk seepage into the commercial sector, or impose a standard rate, applied with a fairly broad brush, requiring domestic users to pay VAT on their supplies when, strictly speaking, the European Court did not require us to do so.<br><br>
On 6 February 1989 when the draft legislation for the proposal was published, Customs and Excise accepted that gas supplied in cylinder form would almost certainly be used for domestic purposes. That is not entirely the case, as 72 per cent. of gas supplied in cylinders is used domestically, leaving 28 per cent. for commercial use. If we split the gas into propane and butane, we find that almost all butane is used for domestic purposes. A small amount is used for commercial purposes, so there is no danger of seepage of the tax into areas where it should not go. The majority of the sales of propane gas are for industrial or commercial use, but it is not a large majority. Therefore, taken overall, three quarters of the gas is used domestically and about a quarter is used commercially.<br><br>
A large number of the users of gas supplied in cylinders should not have to pay VAT on their supplies but, as a result of the Bill, they will. I am speaking not only in a personal capacity, but on behalf of the Small Business Bureau of which I am a vice-chairman. It has asked my right hon. and hon. Friends to reconsider the proposal. Various unfortunate consequences will flow from it that will harm small businesses, which are subject to the legislation.<br><br>
First, traders who are not registered for VAT and who will decide not to register, even after the Bill becomes law, will not be able to recover the VAT. Therefore, they must either absorb the extra cost or pass it on to their customers. Secondly, traders who are forced to register because of the change will have to endure the administration and compliance costs of so doing. Thirdly, registered traders who continue to be registered will face extra cash flow problems—which, in certain instances, may be significant—as a result of having to pay extra VAT to Customs and Excise because of the taxability of their supplies.<br><br>
In England and Wales, almost all the stockists of LPG are registered, so we need not worry too much about that. But about 5 per cent. of them are not registered for VAT in Scotland, and about a quarter of the stockists are unregistered in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
We must consider the increase in the financial burden of people who live in peripheral areas. In most cases, they have no alternative other than to purchase cylinder gas to cook, heat their homes and possibly light their dwellings. So for a small amount of revenue that Customs and Excise would derive from such a change in the law, we may be imposing considerable hardships on people who are least able to bear them—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Just as the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) played the devil's advocate in respect of the absent, ethereal members of the SLD, I am playing the devil's advocate on behalf of Conservatives who have a conscience. We

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
are entitled to express such an argument. As the political system is changing so rapidly and the Labour party is hurtling far to the Right of the Conservative party, we may change our roles and enthusiasms.<br><br>
I believe that there are deficiencies in the proposals for bulk supplies of LPGs. If more than 2,500 litres of gas is delivered in liquid state, it bears VAT, but if less than 2,500 litres is delivered, it is zero rated. A criterion by volume is unnecessary and will create anomalies. It will lead to commercial users obtaining supplies in contravention of the European Court judgment. Commercial users will be able to obtain supplies of less than 2,500 litres, which will be zero rated, in contravention of the European Court's judgment, and domestic consumers, who need not pay VAT, will do so if they receive more than 2,500 litres.<br><br>
Information on who receives supplies of gas is greater than that on those who receive other forms of fuel. Because the gas is pumped in under pressure and is highly dangerous and explosive, virtually all the tanks used are owned by the oil companies that supply the gas. They know who their customers are and can tell which are commercial and which are domestic. Very few people who use such gas in bulk are domestic customers.<br><br>
The industry proposes a different criterion of an installed tank capacity of 2 tonnes. That would simplify the administration of the tax because only 3 per cent. of tanks have a capacity of more than 2 tonnes, but they account for 75 per cent. of sales. With a small amount of administration, a large part of the objective would be achieved. Because of the way in which the gas is distributed by tanker, drops of less than 2,500 litres are often delivered to commercial users because the tanks need to be emptied out at the end of the day. We propose a criterion that would be less onerous on those who are supplied and probably better for Customs and Excise.<br><br>
Why was the figure of 2,500 litres chosen as the criterion for bulk supply? It does not fit in with the calorific equivalents of other fuels mentioned in the clause. Note (2)(f) refers to 2,300 litres of fuel oil, which is equivalent calorifically to 3,335 litres of petroleum gas, so petroleum gas seems to have been unfairly treated compared with oil.<br><br>
There will be a temptation to reduce the drop size to avoid VAT. That is not good for tax morality, nor for the industry, because it will tend to increase the cost of administration and delivery. In addition, for bulk supplies of more than 2,500 litres, the industry will be obliged in cases of doubt to seek a declaration from the person supplied that he will use it for domestic purposes and not commercial purposes if it is supplied on zero-rated terms. Calor Gas Ltd, which is the largest supplier, has informed me that it will have to seek more than 7,000 declarations a year and that the cost of the changes in its computer software programs to calculate the VAT and change its present systems is estimated to be £100,000. Other firms will be faced with similar problems.<br><br>
I believe that we can achieve the object that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has set himself
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
and adhere to the spirit of the European Court judgment, without penalising domestic consumers and imposing on the poorer parts of the country the kind of burdens I pointed out.</span></p>
<p>9.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have some sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). It seems that a lot of administration and the introduction of VAT into a sector where everyone could do without it will be the result of the Bill. We are particularly interested in the Economic Secretary's explanation of the differences between notes 2(e) and 2(f). The hon. Member for Tatton referred to it, but the calorific value of LPG is about 1.45 times that of oil, so there seems to be some inequity there. We should like to know whether there is any chance of avoiding introducing VAT here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton was disappointed that I was not persuaded by his arguments. I always find his arguments reasonable, moderate and persuasive—it was just his last amendment that I could not accept. Once again he has put forward a cogent case as eloquently as we have come to expect.<br><br>
There are alternative ways of approaching the problem with the ruling, which my hon. Friend described as iniquitous. We felt that the appropriate way was to recognise that the bulk of cylinders go to individuals. Some, as he said, go to industrial users. We thought that if we zero-rated them at the final stage of the delivery chain, the fact that a few would go into industrial use would be overlooked by the Commission and that we would not face an infraction process. However, my hon. Friend wants us to go further than that and to zero-rate further back down the chain. That will not affect final consumers at all. The only benefit will be to retailers. He believes that some retailers are unregistered, indeed he gave figures—I am not aware of their source—that suggested that many retailers in Northern Ireland are unregistered traders handling LPG. That does not coincide with our view.<br><br>
An unregistered trader must have a turnover of less than £23,600, which includes the sale of zero-rated products. It is hard to see how a typical retailer with gross margins of less than 35 per cent. and net margins of much less than that would make a living. I would naturally look at the figures if my hon. Friend can persuade me that they come from a reputable source. I know that he only ever deals in reputable sources.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was also concerned about cash flow. When a wholesaler or manufacturer supplying Calor gas puts VAT on it, he gets the VAT on average some six weeks before he is required to pay that VAT over to Customs. He is getting a cash flow advantage out of those further down the distribution chain which he enjoys. If he wishes, he can pass on some of that advantage to those further down the chain. If not, he can scarcely complain that they are being hard done by under the VAT system. In general the cash flow effect is fairly small, and unlikely to add more than a tiny amount to the overall cost of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
product, even if the manufacturing supplier does not pass on any advantage to those further down. We shall keep these and all matters under review in the light of any information that my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton can give me, but I am not persuaded at this stage that it would be right to change the arrangements for cylinders.<br><br>
On bulk deliveries, my hon. Friend saw no case for a quantitative limit. Rather, he seemed worried that some industrial users might get the benefit of small deliveries of less than 2,500 litres zero-rated. I do not think that we need worry about the possibility. If they do, it is a de minimis problem arising from the way in which we have chosen to help domestic consumers.<br><br>
For all forms of fuel and power such as gas and electricity where we set a limit and which we believe go to a final consumer we asked the industries what a typical large household supply was, and 2,500 litres was the figure for LPG. The limits are not measured on a calorific equivalent basis from one fuel to another.<br><br>
My hon. Friend none the less pressed his case on the impact of the procedure. He wished to base the figure not on size of delivery but on the size of the container. If the method that we have chosen proves to have disadvantages in application we are prepared to look at it again. I assure my hon. Friend that in the light of his remarks we shall keep the matter under review. We think it appropriate to go ahead at this stage with the approach that we have adopted in the clause. It is designed to be fairly generous to consumers, and we are not too worried if it is generous to some industrial users as well.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Member for Wrexham, we could not avoid applying VAT to LPG or even to butane. We could not single them out. They were clearly covered by the Court judgment and we had to apply VAT, but we have done so in a fairly generous way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary has not answered the central issue, which is that there should be equity of treatment between users of different fuels. He has failed to appreciate that we can achieve such treatment only on the basis of the calorific value of the fuel consumed. Moreover, people use LPG for cooking as well as for heating, so the requirements of LPG users are likely to be larger than those of people purchasing fuel oils. There is a difference of 1.4 in the calorific value, which gives the figure of 3,335. Moreover, people use more LPG, so the treatment of those consumers is even more inequitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that some industrial users might benefit from the way in which the Government have chosen to help domestic consumers. The changes are all related to a European Court of Justice judgment that sought to identify and to separate domestic from non-domestic users. Does the Minister believe that the European Court will consider that the infraction is too small to be worth pursuing, or might the Commission still feel it necessary to go to the court again? Will the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
Minister assure us that there will be no further changes on VAT rating for the items in clause 20?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), the question is not one of equity. We are not trying to be equitable between users of different types of fuel and saying that they should all have the same allowance. We are trying to reach a judgment on the normal maximum amount that a household uses or takes as a delivery. Deliveries of coal may tend to be smaller in calorific terms—because of their bulk—than are deliveries of oil. If so, we shall take whatever seems to be the normal maximum that indicates a household delivery and any larger delivery—would probably be going to an industrial firm or commercial business.<br><br>
That is all that we are trying to do, but if a private user uses more or receives larger deliveries, he can still retain a zero rate by means of declaration. Unfortunately, that user will have to go through that bureaucratic procedure, but we are trying to minimise the need for the supplier to identify who is a final consumer and who is a consumer by means of customer declarations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The law may constrain the size of tank to which deliveries are being consigned. If the law sets an upper limit of a certain amount on the supply, the chances are that a domestic tank will be of a size below that level. Therefore, the law is defining, a priori, the size of the consignment, so there will be inequitable treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not have a tank-based system and calculate on the basis of individual deliveries. There may be legal or other reasons why the normal maximum delivery to a household is what it is in the case of a certain fuel. We are not trying to say what is right or wrong but to make the best pragmatic judgment of when a delivery is going to a household and when it is going to an industrial business. We consulted the industry and originally suggested 2,000 litres for LPG. The industry said that it was more likely to be 2,500 litres and that up to that level most deliveries would be to households. We accepted that figure and put in into the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) asked whether there was a danger of a subsequent infraction proceeding. We hope not, but we cannot give an absolute guarantee as it is up to the Commission. We think that we have got it right and that it will agree that it is a reasonable and pragmatic way of operating a ruling. We are trying not to negate the whole impact of the judgment but to retain zero rates for households while applying a standard rate to industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his willingness to receive further representations on the subject.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

INCORRECT CERTIFICATES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 15, line 38, leave out "equal to" and insert "twice".<br><br>
Why does the clause refer to a penalty? If a person to whom supplies are made gives an incorrect certificate, is found out and made to pay what he should have paid, I should not have thought that that was a penalty. The amendment merely proposes to replace the words "equal to" with the word "twice".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In VAT law, the supplier is responsible for getting the tax right. Because of the nature of the problem that we face in distinguishing whether the end user is a final consumer, a household user or an industrial user, we have introduced a system of declarations. Obviously, we believe that people should make honest and true declarations, but the ultimate legal responsibility lies with the supplier. I suppose that, in pure theory, any penalty for wrong doing should apply to the supplier. Clearly, if the supplier has taken all reasonable precautions and accepted a declaration in good faith from his customer we would not want to punish him. None the less, we want to reclaim in full the money that the customer was liable to pay, so we have established a civil so-called penalty to achieve that.<br><br>
To go further and make it penal might be contrary to EC law and, certainly, it would be further than we want to go at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Economic Secretary says, but it could open the floodgates to certain suppliers. Many suppliers have integrity and will not do that, but some could have been found habitually to have the wrong certificates. If that happens, further legislation must be introduced. However, I suggest that the Economic Secretary's Department should monitor the position to see whether certain suppliers habitually have to pay tax that they should have paid earlier. I hope that further legislation will not be necessary, but we must be ready for it should that happen. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lilley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present clause 23 provides the taxpayer with a statutory right of recovery of overpaid VAT only when that overpayment arose as a result of a mistake. The commissioners of Customs and Excise are empowered to resist a claim for recovery on grounds of unjust enrichment but that defence cannot apply if the claim does not arise from an overpayment. Although overpayments attributable to causes other than mistake are likely to be rare, they cannot be ruled out.

<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marek</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary is a prominent member of the No Turning Back group. In view of the statements made by Commissioner Scrivener, it would be useful if the Economic Secretary clarified whether they affect the measures in the Bill. Perhaps, he could go further and arrange for one of his hon. Friends to table a written question to try to discover whether it is still the Government's view that VAT should not be imposed on some items, as promised by the Prime Minister, and whether that can be extended to put a zero rating on items such as housing, newspapers and periodicals.
