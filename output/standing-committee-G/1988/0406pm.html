BASIC CREDIT APPROVALS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [this day] No. 62, in page 50, line 47, after '(1),' insert
<br><blockquote><p>"not later than three months."—[<i>Sir George Young.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 289, in page 50, line 47, leave out "Before the beginning of each financial year" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Before the 30 November in the year preceding each financial year".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to remind the Government that the main objectives of their new system, set out in the consultation paper "Capital Expenditure and Finance", were to provide a sound basis for local authorities to plan their capital programmes with confidence. My argument is that it would be difficult for local authorities to meet that if the Secretary of State insisted on credit approvals as late as 31 March.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will not say that the Autumn Statement will deal with the planning totals for the year in question and that that is the limiting factor. The Government's proposals for a three-year planning horizon set out in the White Paper, "A New Public Expenditure Total", reduce the importance of the Autumn Statement.<br><br>
Credit approvals in aggregate will be set out in three-year bands. In those circumstances, it should be possible to translate planned credit approvals into credit approvals for individual authorities by the 30 November date required by the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not unhappy with the arguments put by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) or by my hon. Friends. It is important for people to receive the earliest possible information, which is the reason why the Government put forward the scheme to which the hon. Gentleman referred, to give three-year proposals.<br><br>
Although from time to time we beat each other around the ears about planning. Inevitably and inescapably that is part of our system and we are trying to make that part as small as possible here. There is no doubt that we shall be able to give earlier estimates. We shall be giving the authorities provisional figures based upon earlier indications of credit approvals for up to two years ahead and will discuss that proposal in detail in amendments Nos. 292 and 293.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
When we issue basic credit approvals under Clause 44, that will be confirmation of the final figures of the credit approvals because local authorities will already have had two previous provisional figures.<br><br>
The real question is when that final figure can be given, and we should have a little look at when that inevitably must be. The final figure cannot be given until after the Autumn Statement, no matter what the hon. Gentleman says. There is no way in which the figure can be given earlier, and I hope very much that it will be close to the previous estimates. But we must first see the final figures for the year and the plans for the year to come.<br><br>
We are constrained in some ways by the public expenditure process and it is worth saying that until now the Government have shown their concern to get those figures out as early as possible. Even when people have not received their previous provisional figures in the way in which we are now suggesting, basic allocations have been issued relatively early. Last year they were all issued by 9 December. In the future system those figures will not be the first time they are known because they will be final figures and people will have had two opportunities for assessments in advance. Historically, the Government have not been bad at delivering figures early for the Committee's approval.<br><br>
The question, then, is why do I not wish the provision to be written into the Bill in this form? I will explain to the Committee and, in particular, to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) who put his case with such care and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fluency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Courtesy was the word I sought.<br><br>
There are times when information cannot be given early. Clause 44 provides for an improvement as, no doubt, we all agree. It arises partly from the longer-term information that will be provided. Housing basic allocations for the past five years have been issued on various dates between 8 and 19 December. We have met the deadlines that amendment No. 62 proposes.<br><br>
The Department is also responsible for the "other services" block and, with a few exceptions, basic allocations have also been issued by 19 December. Some exceptions are allocations to single service authorities where special circumstances prevail. I will outline the two exceptions which will explain to my hon. Friend why I am wary of taking into statute the dates that he suggests. There are times when delay is necessary not because of the Government's programme but because of consultations with local authorities.<br><br>
The allocations are for shire districts in respect of 1986–87, which were issued on 27 January, and for metropolitan districts for 1988–89 which were issued on 14 January. They were late in each case because consultations were still taking place with relevant local authority associations. I am not blaming anyone. I am merely saying that, on those occasions, the authorities felt that they wanted further discussions about the basis on which the figures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0800">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 687</span>
would be calculated before we issued them because of the problems that they anticipated.<br><br>
I am loth to have to say that those discussions could not continue because the statute tied us so tightly that we would be in the embarrassing position of the people who the statute was supposed to protect asking that it not be enforced, and the people who were willing to hold up the announcements to continue negotiations not being able to do so because the statute provided that they could not.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton has three clear elements of support in saying the earlier the date, the better. There is the natural desire of the Government and local authorities to provide the information as quickly as possible. There is the fact that the Government have shown their bona fides by introducing the new system which itself is an improvement on the old and which contains the three-year forward look and the new arrangements, which themselves are an improvement.<br><br>
There is also the history. In all the cases that I have examined, the Government have for the past five years met the sort of timetable which both sides of the Committee envisage with their amendments except on two serious occasions, on both of which they delivered the figures before the end of January. These hold-ups occurred not because of the Government but because those with whom we were having discussions wanted further time. In those circumstances, there is no evil to be stopped. The Government have shown by their actions and their proposals in the Bill that they wish to keep to the proposed timetable.<br><br>
I add this assurance. I intend that in future, the figures shall be delivered at least as quickly as during the past five years, and, I hope, even more quickly. They are confirmation of figures that will already have been presented and, in that sense, are already much in advance of the previous system.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend the Member of Acton wants a further assurance, I can tell him that the priority of my officials and of Ministers is to set up the system so that as rapidly as possible after the Autumn Statement the figures issued to local authorities can be confirmed as final. There will be delays only where local authorities seek further negotiations, which seems a reasonable stage at which both sides would be satisfied.<br><br>
I hope that with those assurances my hon. Friend the Member for Acton and Opposition Members will not press to a Division their rather tighter amendments, which could disadvantage both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even though the Minister has apparently rejected the amendments of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) I urge him to accept them.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister agrees that the basis of good housekeeping is sound financial planning. Ideally local authorities should be able to plan their capital expenditure by preparing capital programmes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
for at least three years ahead. Many authorities still take this sensible approach to capital spending, despite the fact that their planning is often rendered meaningless by huge, last minute reductions in their permitted levels of spending.<br><br>
The clause would enable the Secretary of State to announce a local authority's credit approval in March each year, immediately before the financial year to which it related. The announcement would come after the council had completed its budgetary process, when there was no opportunity to plan a meaningful capital programme for the ensuing year. It would lead to badly planned expenditure, inadequate budgets and ultimately to panic spending and waste. The announcement of credit approval by the end of December is the least that can be offered to local authorities to allow them to plan capital expenditure.<br><br>
The amendment does not go far enough. Under the old housing investment programme regime, when annual announcements were made the allocations for the next two years were guaranteed. Although in general HIP allocations were woefully inadequate, at least the system gave local authorities a basis on which to plan their strategies. Towards the end of the HIP era the giving of guarantees was discontinued, leaving authorities to manage on a year-to-year basis. It can be argued that the change made a mockery of the housing strategy statement, which was an integral part of the HIP submission.<br><br>
The new system of credit approvals will perpetuate the guessing game for future years. It is essential that the uncertainty over the next year of account is removed by giving at least three months' notice of credit approvals. Really 31 December is the last practicable date on which credit approvals must be notified. If they appeared any later, local authorities would have exceptional difficulties in completing their budgets in a considered manner.<br><br>
The problem for county councils is especially severe. They are obliged to notify their precepts no later than 1 March. If the Secretary of State announces their credit approvals at the end of December, they will be left with only two months in which to finalise their revenue and capital budgets. Notification of credit approvals and the subsequent calculation of the revenue cost of capital schemes is an important element in any local authority budget. Although many authorities will be well advanced with their budget work by 31 December, they cannot finalise their precept requirements until they know the revenue cost of capital.<br><br>
In devising the new arrangements to control capital expenditure the Government have recognised that the previous system was unhelpful to local authorities' forward planning. This is acknowledged by the provision to notify minimum credit approvals for the subsequent two years. This useful initiative will undoubtedly be of some assistance, but its value will be negated if the vital information—the credit approval for the budget year—is delayed beyond the end of the calendar year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for his response to my amendment. I cannot speak for Opposition
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0801">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
Members, but I am satisfied with his Department's assurances of good intent that the credit approvals will be issued as soon as possible after the Autumn Statement and that if there were a delay, it would be at the request of the local authority associations and not as a result of his Department's inactivity<br><br>
The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) said that the credit approvals have to be given by 1 March because the precepting authorities have to announce the precept by then. Therefore, the only debate is whether there is any advantage in including 1 March, but I am not convinced that that would take us any further.<br><br>
There is a safety valve in clause 45 because if the Department gets it wrong, a supplementary credit approval can be given. It would not be the end of the world if the figures were produced early and it was discovered that those for one district council were a bit tight, because clause 45 provides the opportunity to put it right.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Against the declaration of good faith and the Department's sense of urgency in wishing to help local authorities, I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make one or two concluding remarks about amendment No. 289. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham made some important points and I accept that the Minister is trying to allay our anxieties. Clause 45 is relevant but it does not solve the problem.<br><br>
I understand that the Minister is saying that the measure is drafted in its present form because in some cases—he mentioned the metropolitan and shire counties—consultation has not been completed. It should not be beyond the wit of the draftsmen of the Bill to include a phrase such as,
<br><blockquote><p>"or on the completion of the consultations with the local authorities, whichever were the later."</p></blockquote>
That would not be unusual in legislation and would provide a failsafe device to meet the circumstances that the Minister described.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment is good at producing the estimates on time, but Departments such as the Department of Health, the Department of Social Security and the Home Office often face difficulties. The problem arises when another Department does not produce its basic credit approvals in time for the local authorities. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he will intervene with other Departments when the delay is due to them and not to consultation or to the local authorities. I hope that the Minister will respond to my suggestion either now or later, as I know that he is anxious about not accepting the amendment. The words that I proposed were off the top of my head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman one assurance. It is part of my Department's job to ensure that material and information is available because it is our lead issue and we are conducting discussions with the local authorities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 690</span>
The hon. Gentleman's off-the-cuff comments sound all right but I suspect that they will not work in the way that he intends. I shall go away and think about them, but in the meantime I shall explain why I believe that they will not work. It would still be open to either party to claim that the negotiations were continuing if they did not want to come to a conclusion. In other words, however the proposal is drafted, it would be necessary to rely on the good will of the Department and, I suppose, of a recalcitrant local authority. However, I shall consider the wording suggested by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
We are the only Department responsible for issuing approvals and, we shall ensure that they go out as quickly as possible. I give that assurance and will consider the other matters that were raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 290, in page 51, line 4, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Except for a tolerance of 10 per cent. between financial years".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 63, in page 51, line 4, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect only for the financial year in respect of which it is issued and".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 294, in page 51, line 27, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Except for a tolerance of 10 per cent. between financial years".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 290 would maintain the arrangements under the existing capital controls under which there is a 10 per cent. tolerance between the years. Amendment No. 294 would permit a 10 per cent. tolerance on supplementary credit approvals. The two amendments are closely linked.<br><br>
Tolerance allows a local authority to anticipate or carry forward 10 per cent. of its prescribed expenditure allocations in any year, or an amount equal to that. Under the proposed system, credit approvals will be lost if not used in that year. There will be no tolerance provision.<br><br>
In the consultation paper, "Capital Expenditure and Finance", which was issued in July 1988, the Government argued that a tolerance provision was unnecessary because flexibility was provided through authorities' ability to finance capital expenditure by means of revenue contributions, the profits of trading undertakings and the proceeds of asset sales.<br><br>
The local authority associations do not accept that, as the Minister has probably been told. It is difficult to assess precisely capital expenditure on a programme. It depends on several factors—such as planning approval, the performance of contractors and, in certain circumstances, the weather. What will happen in London when responsibility for education is transferred to local authorities or, indeed, in other areas where they already administer it? Suppose that a school building programme is delayed by the weather. How could an authority carry over tolerance because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0802">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
of the contractor's inability to complete on time? That is the type of issue that worries us.<br><br>
On amendment No. 294, clause 45(3) permits the Secretary of State to specify the period over which a supplementary credit approval—SCA—shall have effect. It is possible that this period could span two or more financial years. If the supplementary credit approval is issued with more than six months of the financial year to run, the Secretary of State may specify that it will have effect only until the end of the financial year.<br><br>
Difficulties can be envisaged. If there were difficulties of forecasting, expenditure might not match the amount of the supplementary credit approval even if it is incurred during the effective period. Moreover, the effective period may end before all relevant expenditure has been incurred. Both those difficulties illustrate the need to have some tolerance provision on the amount of the SCA and the effective period. The amendment would tackle those potential problems by permitting a 10 per cent. tolerance.<br><br>
Perhaps I may leave the matter there for the Minister to respond. Depending to some extent on his reply, I might wish to return on another issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to speak to amendment No. 63, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). He is attending a funeral, but has given me a basic credit approval to speak to the amendment. The amendment is slightly more generous than that tabled by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) in that it would allow the basic credit approval to run forward and would not be restricted to a specific financial year.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, local authorities have difficulty deciding exactly when expenditure will take place. Let us consider, for example, the proposed Acton town centre. Incidentally, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will look at that when he visits the London borough of Ealing next month. It is very much hoped to begin to make progress this year, but that depends on a planning decision as a result of a public inquiry. It may not begin until the next financial year or, indeed, the year after.<br><br>
Unless there is some tolerance—an ability to carry forward credit approvals—it is difficult to know how major expenditure of interest to a local community can take place. The present system has some flexibility but it is not clear how that flexibility will manifest itself under the new system if there is no provision for the 10 per cent. tolerance or the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) is not accepted.<br><br>
The Association of District Councils is worried. When planning capital expenditure, district councils may have more difficulty than metropolitan and borough councils in coming to terms with the new regime unless there is some flexibility. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to explain how the Bill will overcome the problems to which the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) and I have referred.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That issue needs to be aired. If I believed that there was a difficulty, I should certainly try to find an alternative way of dealing with the matter. It is manifestly true that, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) said, many things may happen, especially if a local authority has a relatively small capital expenditure programme. It may have one major programme at a time and if that is held up, perhaps because of bad weather, there may be difficulty in assessment and in remaining within agreed bounds. But the matter must be considered in perspective.<br><br>
The 10 per cent. tolerance this year would amount to approximately £250 million. The tolerance that we foresee arising from the greater flexibility that the new system will allow in expenditure from receipts is £4,500 million. There will be considerable flexibility. In addition, the Secretary of State will have the opportunity, which will be much more flexible than previously, of issuing supplementary credit approval that need not be tied to one year. Such approval could apply for longer and could be issued to overcome a specific problem. It is conceivable that a local authority may be left out of the share in the £4,500 million flexibility because of a series of unfortunate circumstances. It may find itself with no elbow room on revenue contributions; perhaps it could not have saved money or used receipts. But there is a long-stop in the supplementary credit approval.<br><br>
It is not sensible to continue the 10 per cent. tolerance at £250 million with the extra flexibility, which, in the current year, would total £4,500 million.<br><br>
There is a problem with the amendment fathered upon my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). I am sure that he noticed the problem immediately. The position that the amendment would allow led us to introduce and uphold the 1980 changes. Local authorities had accumulated large amounts of credit approval and if that had been used at one time all controls would have been overtaken. The suggestion that there should be no limit to credit approval once it is given has been tried and was found so wanting that we had to change the system. My hon. Friend had to work the changed system and would not have been able to work the previous one.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) has gone too far in his proposal. I have more sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Hammersmith—I say that with pleasure—about retaining the present tolerance. However, in the light of the comparison between the £250 million of which we talk and the £4.5 billion which is available under the flexibility inherent in the new structure, my hon. Friend's proposal is not the right way forward. I think that the hon. Member for Hammersmith will agree that, despite some general fears, specific examples of authorities that might be caught by this have not yet appeared. But I will gladly look at the issue again if specific examples come up in the next few weeks where we feel that there is a problem. I believe that that is unlikely, but I would wish to look at any such cases because I do not want to make the system any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0803">Image</span>

more rigid than it has to be, and I think that this £4.5 billion makes the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will notice that my name is not added to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) on the amendment paper and that only one barrel of the double-barrelled shotgun on the Back Benches has been fired. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is a man of reckless generosity—I say that straight away—and I accept that it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to press the amendment. Were he here, I know that he would have been totally swayed by my right hon. Friend's argument. If he had not been, he would have immediately made his views known to my right hon. Friend, bearing in mind that he sits next to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he had not been swayed, he would have had his arms broken—one or the other! I am not quite sure where this £4.5 billion—or was it £4.5 million—will come from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is £4.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is money that is growing on trees in the Minister's garden. I doubt if it will be a reality to many local authorities after the Bill takes effect.<br><br>
Does the Minister envisage supplementary credit approvals only being given after a basic credit approval has been given, or does he see supplementary credit approvals being granted in advance? That is relevant because approvals given by the Home Office, for example, will necessarily be supplementary credit approvals. What I am not so sure about is whether the supplementary approvals referred to in clause 45 must be brought into effect before a basic credit approval is given—for example, in a case where there has been a failure to agree issues before the end of the financial year—or whether they come in after a basic approval limit has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has caught me on a sore point, because I like the English of these measures to be accurate—as he knows. I fear that I have to tell him that although, as I understand English, it is difficult to have a supplementary credit approval when there is no basic credit approval, it is possible. I dislike it, as a form of words, but it seems right in the context of achieving flexibility. The hon. Gentleman may be assured that, if he would like to join a small competition as to what we might call supplementary credit approvals so as not to embarrass us linguistically, I should be happy. But he can certainly have them in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is good news for us borrowers!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 51, line 18, at end insert—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) Before the Secretary of State shall issue notices in accordance with subsection (1) above he is required to consult with the local authority associations.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 296, in clause 46, page 51, line 43, leave out "may have regard" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult the local authority associations on factors to be taken into account in determining credit approvals and shall have regard.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that escape me for the moment, several other amendments associated with this were not selected, but that is the luck of the draw.<br><br>
Amendment No. 291 requires the Secretary of State to consult the local authority associations before issuing credit approvals. Amendment No. 296 requires consultation with local authorities on factors to be taken into account in determining them.<br><br>
In the Bill there are no provisions requiring the Secretary of State to consult local government on the overall level of capital expenditure to be undertaken in any year. That contrasts with the Government's willingness to continue to discuss with local government levels of revenue expenditure to inform decisions on needs assessments under the new revenue finance system. We believe that there should be consultation on those matters and on capital expenditure.<br><br>
The Government may respond that such consultation is unnecessary, but I hope that they will not take that view. The process is becoming increasingly centralised, the Government tell local authorities what they consider necessary. The amendment tries to encourage the Government to respond to local authority requests, which would move upwards to the Minister, instead of there being a diktat that comes down from him.<br><br>
A wider issue is involved. When issuing credit approvals, the Secretary of State may have regard to factors that appear to him to be appropriate. That is a wide-ranging power, as we have often complained. There is no requirement for the Secretary of State to consult with anyone, nor to reveal the factors that he has taken into account. He can keep to himself the reason why he has reached a particular decision.<br><br>
As with the present system, credit approvals will be derived from the views of individual Departments about the amount that authorities should spend on the services that they control, within a specified total. The main service blocks are housing, transport, social services and education. Separate blocks exist for Home Office services and the urban programmes.<br><br>
At present, local authorities are involved in the bidding process. When they receive their allocations, they generally do not know what criteria have been adopted in setting those allocations. Under the new system, although basic credit approvals will not be earmarked for specific services, they will have been derived from annual capital guidelines that are service-specific. The Home Office and urban programme services will, I believe, be the supplementary credits. The Minister should tell local authorities what criteria will be adopted in allocating capital resources in respect of housing, transport,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0804">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 695</span>
social services, education, Home Office services, urban programmes and other services.<br><br>
Criticisms have been levelled at the Government by the Comptroller and Auditor General about the distribution of capital allocations under the present system. The Department of the Environment document entitled "Control of Local Authorities' Capital Expenditure" said in May 1986:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are however, certain features of the distribution procedures which indicate gaps in the extent to which they take account of the particular spending needs of individual authorities".</p></blockquote>
Other bodies that have commented on the lack of effective consultation include the Audit Commission, the Department of the Environment's stock condition inquiry, the Building Employers Confederation and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. All have recognised that there is a problem in the rationale that the Government use in reaching their conclusion, and the lack of effective consultation that would enable a local authority to understand the Government's aims and intentions and to make a meaningful input to them.<br><br>
The amendments are designed to give local authorities a greater opportunity to influence the Government and to understand the Government's thinking. I hope that the Government will take account of comments that have been made by Departments and other bodies about the lack of effective consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the central theme of the remarks of the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I am entirely at one with him that that consultation, criteria, openness and collegiality, which may be the best word, in the discussion of those matters are important. Obviously, it is ultimately the Government's responsibility to decide the end totals and to try to direct help in accordance with needs, but the more that this is a common rather than a confrontational course the better. Certainly, it must not be one that is mystic and his points are well taken.<br><br>
I suggest that a clue was given in the hon. Gentleman's comment about the unhappiness shown at the meeting of needs with resources. That is one reason for the major changes in the Bill. When we discuss the matter later, there will be people who are unhappy about the way we have proceeded. I am not trying to pre-empt that argument, but I hope that all members of the Committee will agree that we have at least tried to deal with the problem of the inflexibility of the present system which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, lays down regulations of a kind that make it almost impossible to direct resources to needs. A prize example of that is that a local authority with relatively low needs and high returns from its sales, because it happens to be in an area where prices are high, must have a capital allocation which is comparable with those provided elsewhere where there are low receipts and far greater needs. That has always seemed basically wrong. It is not a matter of merely blaming the Department of the Environment. It is wrong that we should have a system which permits that, and I am not prepared to continue it.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
Therefore, to deal with that problem we must have a better way of taking account of resources, assessing needs and directing central resources towards those who have the greatest need. That is the purpose of those changes.<br><br>
I shall not argue whether our proposals offer the best way of proceeding, although I am sure that we shall hear arguments about that in due course. To bring about those changes, our responsibility for negotiation, discussion and, no doubt, argument with local authorities will increase.<br><br>
I was disposed to accept the amendments of the hon. Member for Hammersmith as they described, in essence at least, what I intend to do and we have tried to do in the past, although not altogether successfully. Whatever the negotiations, we were tied to that formula, so after we had negotiated and found needs that should have been met, we could not meet them specifically. If allocations were increased to an authority which lacked resources, we had to increase them to authorities which already had resources which they could spend freely, and that greatly trammelled the position.<br><br>
The only reasons why we should not accept the amendments is the technical effects which they would have. One is a problem which would be unlikely to occur at present, but I imagine that it could happen in future. If local authority associations were inimical to each other and had different interests, the effect of amendment No. 296 might create real difficulties because they could stop others getting allocations which they should have. I would not be happy if that were the result, so I shall describe how allocations are made at present and how more effective they will be now that there is flexibility.<br><br>
With housing allocations, there are meetings between local authorities and Department of the Environment regional officers to assess the real needs. That will continue and be increasingly meaningful. The other services block allocations are distributed on the basis of recommendations by local authority associations, so will, to use the hon. Gentleman's expression, "come from the bottom to us" rather than the other way round. The transport allocations are distributed on the basis of transport policy and programme bids by the local authorities.<br><br>
In practice, consultation is inevitably tied to that. The education allocation is distributed on the basis of indicators of need, which are agreed after negotiations and discussions with the local authorities. However, it is my experience that negotiations are not always agreed because interests differ about which indicators should have the greatest weight. That is one of the problems facing us.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I am not sure how best to emphasise my assurances. It is my intention that the negotiations, discussions and consultations will be at least as extensive as they are now. I expect them to be more effective because the Department will be more able to take account of need under the new structure. The effects of consultation will be more readily carried through. The sort of problem underlined by the Audit Commission should be avoided, which is one reason
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0805">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 697</span>
for the Bill being as it is. As a new flexibility will be available, I wish to establish forms whereby local authorities will feel that even if they do not get their own way—which is inevitable, because not everyone is happy at the end of a discussion—they will at least feel wholly involved in the discussions for allocation. If the Opposition or my hon. Friend have ideas on how to extend that, I will happily examine them.<br><br>
The amendments will not achieve what is sought, but I hope that my assurances and the opportunity for additional consultation will meet what I believe to be our joint desire to ensure that as far as possible within the total, local authorities should have as much flexibility and consultation as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Basically, the Minister is saying that the amendments are a good idea, but he does not want them in the Bill. I shall tell the Minister a story about his hon. Friend the Minister for Pudsey (Sir George Shaw). It is true that he is no longer a Minister, but that is the Prime Minister's absence of mind rather than her mendacity. However, he is a "Sir". Three or four years ago he tore up his notes in the middle of a speech—it might have been in this very Committee Room—when I and my hon. Friends were arguing that he should accept an amendment to the Public Order Bill to make radical harrassment a criminal offence, and said, "What the hell. Put it in the Bill." He knew it was right. The name "Sir John Selwyn Gummer" has a certain ring to it. The Minister may give up the idea of being a Minister, if the Prime Minister gets absent-minded again. That is something that Conservative Members have to live with. I ask the Minister to tear up his notes and accept the amendment. I give way to the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes), who is obviously desperate for a knighthood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am humbled. Perhaps I am due for a knighthood. I am not sure whether it is old age on my part or on the part of the hon. Gentleman but that is the third time that I have heard him use that charming story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is because the hon. Gentleman has had the misfortune to follow me from Bill to Bill. If he indulges in such masochistic behaviour that is his problem, not mine.<br><br>
There are times when it is not enough for a Minister to spell out the Government's aim in a general comment, because no one can read <i>Hansard</i> in court to show what Ministers meant. The amendments fit the Bill and if only the wording is a problem, surely the Minister can put it in order before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's way of putting his views is immensely tempting. If I move in any way towards him he may think that I am being tempted by the encouragement that he is laying before me, so I suggest that he forgets that. So much of amendment No. 296 is flawed I would be unhappy to promise to reconsider it. In whatever way it were presented, the amendment would produce several problems.<br><br>
We do not need amendment No. 291. For all kinds of reasons the wording does not work, but because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
we are together in what we are trying to achieve, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied if I promise to go away and see if there is some way of achieving what he seeks in the amendment. Perhaps we could then discuss it and possibly bring something back on Report.<br><br>
I cannot make an absolute promise, but I will look at the amendment and see whether it seems worth reconsidering it. I do not wish to sound churlish, but neither should I move too far towards the hon. Gentleman, because he will then say that both my relief from ministerial office and my gracing of the social calendars of Suffolk, Coastal are the result of his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sounds like half a knighthood, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 292, in page 51, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6A) When issuing to an authority its basic credit approval for any given financial year, the Secretary of State shall specify a provisional total for the authority's credit approval for each of the succeeding two financial years, indicating what allowance he intended to make for receipts in those years."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 293, in page 51, line 18, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6AA) when issuing the basic credit approvals for the succeeding two financial years referred to in subsection (6A) above the Secretary of State shall not base them on lower credit approvals than he had specified, nor allow for receipts to a greater extent than he had indicated."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister tries hard on this pair of amendments, he may earn the other half of his knighthood. He may get the credit ratings which are part of our new educational system.<br><br>
The amendments are linked, and require the Secretary of State, when issuing credit approvals for any year, to specify provisional totals for the two following years. When issuing credit approvals for the following years,
<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall not base them on lower credit approvals than he had specified".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State must also specify what allowance he has made for capital receipts when setting credit approvals.<br><br>
One of the Government's key objectives in their new system for controlling local authority capital expenditure is set out in the consultation paper, "Capital Expenditure and Finance", and is:
<br><blockquote><p>"To provide a sound basis for local authorities to plan their capital programmes with confidence."</p></blockquote>
That is not the first time that the Minister has heard that quotation. He keeps assuring us that it contains one of his objectives, and we think that the amendments would help him towards that end.<br><br>
If each local authority has a provisional total for its annual capital guideline, that would be the Government's view of its gross capital expenditure, and it would be financed by means of credit approvals and usable capital receipts. Paragraph A17 of the consultation paper states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0806">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 699</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"When issuing to an authority its BCA for any given financial year, the Secretary of State would specify a provisional total for the authority's ACGs for each of the next two following financial years. He would also indicate what allowance he intended to make for receipts in those years. When he came to issue the final BCA for those years, he would not base them on lower ACGs than he had specified, nor allow for receipts to a greater extent than he had indicated. The Government's present intention is that the total of the provisional ACGs thus specified would be about 85 per cent. and 70 per cent. of the amount consistent with the relevant public expenditure provisions for BCAs for the two following financial years."</p></blockquote>
That is a strange formula and is outdated for planning purposes.<br><br>
Will the Minister give the Committee examples of how such a system would work, and what conclusions local authorities could draw about their likely level of credit? At present it is difficult for them if they are trying to look several years ahead, which is what the Minister expects them to do, and that is just the information that local authorities need.<br><br>
From 1990–91 the proposals in the White Paper, "A New Public Expenditure Planning Total" are implemented, and public expenditure plans will set out credit approvals for three years. If the national aggregate figures are available, there seems no reason why three-year figures from individual authorities cannot be given.<br><br>
It is on that basis that we tabled the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments depend on a view of the Government's reasons for what they are doing, and they are not consistent with the facts.<br><br>
The amendments relate to considerable steps forward, which may be said to be celebrated in the Bill, but not the product of it. They are the product of the new planning totals for public expenditure which we are also introducing from 1990–91. Under the present system local authorities have been interested in capital allocation, but public expenditure has been planned in terms of net capital expenditure. Although we have had expenditure plans for three years ahead, we have not known what level of allocations would be consistent with that expenditure. That has always been the problem. In my simple layman's terms, that means that we have been accounting in two different ways and it has proved difficult to bring both together.<br><br>
It has been possible to determine a plan for one year ahead only when we have known what spending from capital receipts and other resources is likely to be. It is difficult to give assurances on allocations when public expenditure plans do not contain allocation figures for future years. With the new planning total, that will be different. Public expenditure for local authority capital will be measured by Government grants and credit approvals. Therefore, credit approvals will be part of the currency of public expenditure plans and we can plan public expenditure for three years' ahead. That will mean planned credit approval totals for those three years. That is why we can give these forward indications.<br><br>
The difficulty is that those forward indications are not an integral part of this legislation, but result from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
the new planning totals. It was never our intention to enshrine them in the legislation for the new capital finance system. We never said that we would, and it is inappropriate to do so. That would unnecessarily constrain the way in which the assurances could be calculated.<br><br>
I do not want to go too far into the business we shall discuss in clause 46 about how those credit approvals will be determined and how receipts will be taken into account, but I shall say now that it is likely that credit approvals will be based on annual capital guidelines and an allowance to take account of receipts. Frankly, we have not yet decided whether it will be sensible to give forward indications for credit approvals in total or for the annual capital guidelines and receipt allowances separately. That will to some extent depend on how we take account of receipts. We may well want to discuss that with local authorities and perhaps change it in time if, for example, it becomes clear that it is sensible to take account of receipts differently.<br><br>
We are ploughing a new furrow and we want to get it right. I do not want to avoid the issue. The Government want to be as accurate as possible when they give indications of allocations for a three-year period rather than a single year as in the past. That does not arise from the Bill but from the changes in the new planning totals. We should not tie ourselves to a particular way of doing that now when we may think differently after consultations, and even before the first time it is done. Certainly, when the system has operated for a year or two, local authorities may wish to approach the Government to make changes. We do not know that. Therefore, we must have flexibility which would not be available or helped by what happens here.<br><br>
I have not entirely decided how we will give these forward assurances. There are a couple of examples of how we could proceed. We could issue provisional credit approvals that were equal in total to 85 per cent. of public expenditure plans and to 70 per cent. for the following year. We could also issue provisional annual capital guidelines with an assurance about the extent to which we will take account of receipts.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
Forgetting later clauses, the problem is most complex, as the hon. Gentleman may concede. The extent to which capital allowances can be directed to areas of special need have been trammelled by the present position in which even those who have resources outwith the system must also be given capital allocations. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. It is difficult to operate when needs are so diverse. The Bill attempts to regain proper flexibility and to ensure that we can do more for areas of special need.<br><br>
The system will need some shaking down. It is not proper to decide now on a system that is so inflexible that it cannot be altered by our discussions with local authorities. The hon. Member for Hammersmith and I are at one on that because we both believe in discussions. We may find that some local authorities have different views from those of others and we shall want to hear them. I understand from preliminary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0807">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 701</span>
information that local authority associations have differing views on how best to proceed. I certainly feel that it would be wrong to prevent myself or my successors from acting in a different way if experience showed that to be necessary.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that to confine the way in which the system would work within the tight limits that the hon. Gentleman proposed would not do any good. It may tempt a Government to give ridiculously inaccurate figures for the two successive years in order to ensure that whatever they announced later was bound to be higher. That would not help local authorities. I want to make it possible for local authorities to obtain the best possible figures. Having assured the hon. Gentleman that we shall discuss the matter with local authorities in great detail, perhaps he will agree not to proceed down this road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That certainly does not rate a knighthood. In the long run, it may rate lost ministerial office. The problem that the Minister describes is of the Government's own making. The amendments have sought to enable local authorities to do their future planning efficiently. The Government keep saying that that is what they want, but they keep constraining local authorities and changing the rules in such a way as to make it impossible. Having changed the rules several times, they say, "We may wish to do A, or we may wish to do B. We will consult as we go along." I cannot think of another modern Western democracy that does it that way. Almost all of them trust their local constituents and local councillors, and let them get on with the job. The Government say, "We will not trust you to plan ahead. We shall want to pull the plug on you if you do things that we do not like." That must be the wrong road to travel.<br><br>
The Minister's response was not acceptable. Perhaps it will save time on clause stand part if I say now that the Minister has demonstrated the problem of the clause. It tries to constrain local authorities in a way that makes it difficult for them to predict their actions and plan ahead. The provision can only be bad news for local authorities.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not like the clause and intend to press this to a Division. As I have said, the Government are constraining local authorities and making it hard for them to function effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will support the clause. We are doing only what any Government in a Western democracy must. We are ensuring that total capital spending by local authorities, which is an important sector of public expenditure, is within our control. That is an important role of national Government.<br><br>
We seek to make the system more flexible and sensible than it has been in the past. It is a pity that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 702</span>
the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) does not agree. The more flexible mechanism should be widely welcomed. I am sorry that we cannot carry both sides of the committee, but I trust that Conservative Members will give the clause their wholehearted approval.</span></p>

Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) who stepped nobly into the breach when I was unavoidably prevented from moving an earlier amendment.<br><br>
For me and perhaps for one or two other members of the Committee the amendment is a trip down memory lane, involving a small but important aspect. In 1981–82, when we were all that much younger, there was a little Bill on mid-term holdback. Hon. Members who were then in local government may remember it. It enabled the Government to reduce local authorities' allocations in the middle of a financial year. It was an unfortunate proposal and we succeeded in cutting it short in 1982. It appears to have surfaced here, as proposed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.<br><br>
The Minister, will be able to vary an authority's basic credit approval during a financial year and, by implication, to vary it downwards. CIPFA believes that any last minute changes in approvals do not contribute to balanced and reasonable local government decisions, but any late reductions in approvals would make planning difficult.

It could be argued that the clause implies only extra allocations but, elsewhere, the Bill refers to negative amounts. The amendment seeks to clarify the Minister's intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to amendment No. 295. My hon. Friends and I join the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) in drawing attention to this serious matter. Local authorities could be in an anomalous position if amendment No. 295 is not accepted because they could face further problems.<br><br>
We discussed local authorities' use of credit approvals and we must now consider supplementary credit approvals. The amendment would allow local authorities to decide the appropriate period over which to repay a loan raised for supplementary credit approval in respect of capital expenditure as directed by the Secretary of State under clause 31(6), which states, that it:
<br><blockquote><p>"may be treated by the authority concerned as expenditure for capital purposes."</p></blockquote>
The kernel of the amendment concerns what can be treated as capital expenditure.<br><br>
The consultation paper on capital expenditure and finance recognised that authorities could face substantial unbudgeted expenditure of a kind that would normally be charged to the revenue account but which could be spread over several years. One example—there are others—is redundancy payments. The consultation paper suggested that the Secretary of State should issue a supplementary credit approval for such expenditure, thus allowing an authority to capitalise on the expenditure and the money borrowed to finance it. It should be allowed to be spread over several years for redundancies, for example.<br><br>
The clause refers to a period of seven years for the repayment of such a loan. Why seven years? That, too, might cause local authorities a problem if there is a restriction on such an exercise.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
No doubt we shall receive the same reply as before—that there must be a balanced period. Surely we are entitled to something better than simply the cut-off explanation that the Minister gave this morning.<br><br>
Has the period been discussed with local authority associations? In the previous debate, discussions with local authority organisations were mentioned. When considering an earlier amendment, the Minister said that he would consider that matter. I repeat the question now. Has the period of time been discussed with local authorities? Has the seven-year period resulted from consultations with local authority organisations? If not, surely it would be in everyone's interests for such discussions to take place. We believe that it would be best for such discretion to be left with local authorities.<br><br>
If the amendment cannot be accepted, before a firm decision is taken on the issue, local authority associations should at least be able to discuss the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
matter. If they have discussed it, will the Minister explain the outcome of those discussions and why it was decided that seven years should be the maximum period? This important matter causes local authorities anxiety. Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to respond to my questions and remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) has covered most of the points.<br><br>
Subsection (5) specifies that, if a supplementary credit approval is issued for expenditure which is capital expenditure by virtue of a direction given by the Secretary of State under clause 31(6), the maximum amortisation period is seven years.<br><br>
A direction under clause 31(6) is likely to be given by the Secretary of State only in exceptional circumstances such as storm damage or expenditure arising from a disaster. One morning a couple of years ago, people woke up to find that half of London had been blown down. That is a different example from redundancies. It is impossible to predict such exceptional circumstances and the expenditure involved.<br><br>
The amendment would help the Secretary of State and, of course, local authorities, by giving him discretion to specify any amortisation period that he considered appropriate at the time, having considered all the circumstances and any representations from local authorities.<br><br>
A period of seven years seems arbitrary: It could just as well be 10, 20 or 30 years. After all, it is a maximum. It should be left to the authorities' discretion. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like many other members of the Committee, I enjoyed the trip down memory lane with my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). He made a reasonable point and his question was characteristic of his contributions to our proceedings. I can give him the assurance that he seeks, although perhaps not in the way that he expects.<br><br>
It is impossible for supplementary credit approval to be negative because of the words in the Bill. First, the approval is supplementary and, secondly, it is credit not debit approval. It is impossible for the approval to be negative or only half approval. I remember the period to which he referred and I was privileged to be a member of a local authority at that time. I hope that he will accept my assurance that the approval will be supplementary and not the sort of credit approval discussed on clause 44.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) gave the examples that I intended to give. They are superb examples, but may be exceptions to the matters that we have discussed, especially concerning clause 44. I shall return to that. As the hon. Member for Normanton suggested, amendment No. 295 would require the amortisation periods for supplementary credit approvals issued in respect of such expenditure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0809">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 705</span>
to be decided in accordance with the periods specified in regulations under clause 44. I must explain briefly why the amendment is not appropriate.<br><br>
First, we may not need to make regulations under clause 44 specifying amortisation periods for credit approvals. Hon. Members may be aware that we intend to make provision for debt redemption by the reducing balance method. I shall not go into the detail of that method, because I am sure that that would bore the Committee, but it requires local authorities to make charges for debt redemption to their revenue accounts of not less than a fixed percentage of their overall capital indebtedness. Therefore, it is not necessary to make arrangements for amortisation of individual credit approvals and it may be unnecessary to make regulations under clause 44—never mind clause 45—specifying those arrangements. Consequently, supplementary credit approvals, for which we may need to make special arrangements, may need a free-standing provision for amortisation.<br><br>
The examples given by Opposition Members were fair. One concerned redundancy payments and the other damage, for example, storm damage, that adversely affects a local authority. In such circumstances, special arrangements would have to be made, but that is not covered by clause 45. Clause 31(6) will enable my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to direct expenditure, which would ordinarily be charged to revenue, to be charged as expenditure for capital purposes. We envisage that power being used only in exceptional circumstances, for example, redundancy payments or a natural disaster. But such exceptional circumstances are likely to be outside the scope of regulations made under clause 44 and different periods would then be in order. Special provision for such exceptional circumstances would be appropriate.<br><br>
I accept the points made by Opposition Members. I assure them that they have nothing to fear from the clause, so I hope that their amendment will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have noted the Minister's reply. He said that it might not be necessary to use clauses 44 and 45. However, the notes on clauses say of clause 45:
<br><blockquote><p>"This clause provides that any Minister of the Crown may at any time issue to a local authority a supplementary credit approval. It provides that the use of a supplementary credit approval in accordance with clause 47 below shall be limited to credit arrangements and expenditure for capital purposes of a description specified in the credit approval."</p></blockquote>
Clause 47 refers to seven years. The advice contained in the notes on clauses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not suggest that the hon. Gentleman would seek to mislead the Committee, but if he continues to read that paragraph, he will see that it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where regulations so require, a supplementary credit approval shall specify an amortisation period."</p></blockquote>
That probably answers the point that the hon. Gentleman is making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notes say that any Minister of the Crown may issue a supplementary credit approval. Although they also say that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"A supplementary credit approval shall specify an amortisation period",</p></blockquote>
there seems to be doubt and uncertainty about the matter. That is why we tabled the amendment.<br><br>
The Minister has given assurances which are on the record and we have been told about the matters that will be considered in cases that arise, so I shall not press my amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To assist the speedy passage of the Bill and in return for the clarification given by my hon. Friend the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that by this time we are all wearied by jargon. Whatever good or ill may come out of these amendments and clauses, it is certain that the English language is not enhanced by local government Bills. The Minister for Local Government speaks about Cardinal Newman on one day, and on another day presides over words such as "amortisation". That sounds to me like a typical distortion of the English language.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 296 to 299 relate to the factors that the Secretary of State will take into account when considering the criteria for credit approvals. The Bill does not tell us what those factors are, and the purpose of the amendments is to clarify them.<br><br>
Under the new system, basic credit approvals will not be earmarked for specific services, but will have been derived from annual capital guidelines that will be "service specific". The Minister should state specifically what criteria will be adopted in allocating capital resources in respect of such matters as housing, transport, social services, education, other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0810">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 707</span>
services, Home Office services and urban programmes.<br><br>
Recently, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated in a report:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are, however, certain features of the distribution procedures which indicate gaps in the extent to which they"</p></blockquote>
—that is—the Department—
<br><blockquote><p>"take account of the particular spending needs of individual authorities."</p></blockquote>
The amendments seek to discover what the Secretary of State would regard as important in considering the capital needs of individual authorities. There is no doubt that throughout the country there is a need for capital expenditure. The Government have not denied that and the Opposition have stressed that need throughout our proceedings.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
In 1985, the Audit Commission said that there was a backlog of capital work that amounted to £15 billion. The Department of the Environment's stock condition inquiry estimated the cost of renovation and repair for council housing at £18.8 billion. The Building Employers Confederation pointed to a vicious circle of neglect and decay in local authority housing caused by limited investment funds and in 1986 the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors called for the easing of Government limits on housing investment.<br><br>
A host of bodies have declared that there is a need for major capital investment throughout the country. Only recently, the Secretary of State for the Environment told local authorities that they should do much more to clean up their towns and cities but they will only be able to do so if money is pumped into them. For housing, roads, transport, schools and economic development there is need for major capital investment, and unless the Secretary of State can define those factors precisely, we shall be in great difficulty.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 298 and 300 refer to a different aspect of the clause which states that the Secretary of State will take account of likely receipts, as opposed to receipts in hand, when issuing credit approvals. That has caused problems for local authority associations as the Secretary of State has said that he is unlikely to use the general power to take account of future levels of receipts when setting credit approvals. Here we go again. The Minister and the Secretary of State are telling us, "The power is in the Bill, but it is not likely to be used." It is bad practice for the Government to use Bills to pass statutes which they do not intend to use. If the actions of a handful of local authorities in this city are to determine what local authorities throughout the country should do, that is bad practice.<br><br>
I am told that the practice dates back to old army days when a soldier who had committed a misdemeanour would cause all the troops in his battalion to be punished. As well as being bad practice in strict legal terms it means that all local authorities, the majority of which are highly responsible and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
dedicated to delivering services, will be tarred with the same brush, not by local authorities, some of which are regarded as being bad, but by the Government who are telling all local authorities that they must follow this legislation. The Secretary of State implies that it will not be used, but says that it should be on the statute book in case some local authorities become naughty boys.<br><br>
Another problem is that if the power were used it could result in unfair treatment of authorities. What would happen if the expected capital receipts failed to materialise for reasons outside the control of local authorities? Those uncertainties should be removed from the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister may have regard to past capital receipts and that, too, will give rise to uncertainty unless he specifies the date on which capital receipts in hand will be taken into account. The clause is misguided and I hope that the Minister will undertake to accept the spirit of the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I have some sympathy with the attempt to ensure that everyone recognises the sort of factors to be taken into account in assessing credit approvals. I understand the problems that will arise in assessing a local authority's ability to find money from its own resources. But we should look at the larger picture.<br><br>
I was surprised that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) should pray in aid of a reputed plot to distort the Bill because of one or two London authorities. I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's logic. We are trying to meet the proper objection of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there are occasions when allocations and needs are not properly lined up. That is the real meaning of that quotation, which we have now heard twice. We should not only assess the need, but to some extent take account of the ability of a local authority to meet that need. If the ability of local authorities to spend from their own resources had to be taken into account, the total allocations would thereby be diminished. Any Government should have some regard for the total capital expenditure. If a certain sum comes from local authorities funds, the allocations should be diminished by that amount.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen was right when he said that the need for capital investment—we are not here concerned with its level, but the mechanism of it—is greater in some places than in others. We have not been able to direct allocations as we would have wished and we seek an opportunity to do so. It seems peculiar to take no account of acknowledged historic capital receipts. One could not then say that an authority had considerable resources to be taken into account when deciding what allocation was needed.<br><br>
Similarly, it would be odd to say that future capital needs could not be taken into account. The Government have said that it is difficult to assess them. The hon. Gentleman quoted my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I stand by what he said, but if, contrary to the hon. Gentleman's advice, a local authority negotiated to sell its entire housing stock but had not yet got the money, when the time for capital allocations arose, we should decide that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0811">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
the local authority would have—not may have—a considerable capital receipt. Is it to be suggested that we should not, in any circumstances, take that into account when we come to share out the capital allocations?<br><br>
Surely it would be unfair to deny the possibility of ever taking that into account. However, I can assure the Committee that we would have to be very sure that the mechanism for assessing future capital receipts was a proper one before we would use it. The hon. Member for Torfaen alluded to my right hon. Friend's comments. I accept that the problems are considerable, but to stop taking into account capital receipts which are clearly likely to be forthcoming would be even more unfair than the procedure that the hon. Gentleman proposes.<br><br>
I have, of course, more sympathy with the idea that we should put out a list. I want to be as open as possible with the local authorities and the electorate, but the list in amendment No. 299 is so incomplete as to create a distortion which would cause legal difficulties. It lists a series of excellent matters which might be taken into account. They would not all be taken into account in the assessment of the capital allocations in all circumstances. A council trying to work out capital allocations for roads would not, for example, take into account the
<br><blockquote><p>"state of the authority's housing stock".</p></blockquote>
More serious is the fact that a series of other subjects are not included in the list. What about the number of homeless people? What about the state of the authority's schools or roads? the list of matters that ought to be taken into account is endless. Local authorities might well wish them to be included. The suggestion that it is necessary to take into account the state of the local authority's housing stock, but not the state of its schools is surely not sensible.<br><br>
Amendment No. 299 is a reasonable probing amendment, in that it puts forward matters which any rational person would take into account and seeks to find out how the Government see their responsibilities when making their assessments. That is precisely what we are discussing now with local authorities, for not only do matters have to be taken into account, the weight given to any particular factor must be sized up. That is a most important part of our discussions.<br><br>
We could not accept the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Torfaen because that would mean closing off for ever the possibility of taking into account know, expected, likely, future receipts, and that would be unfair to a number of authorities in which he would be most interested—those which will have few future receipts, but which have considerable needs.<br><br>
It would also be difficult to take the list in amendment No. 299 without adding to it to such a degree that it would become meaningless. It would be so long a list that the amendment might as well say, "Or anything else that you would like to add.". Although I have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's aims, these are not helpful amendments, but I can assure him that we shall try to use our powers to match needs and resources more effectively, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 710</span>
certainly more effectively than the Comptroller and Auditor General felt that we were doing at the time of his report.<br><br>
I am sorry that many of the words used in the assessment of both needs and resources are ones that the late, lamented Cardinal Newman would have found it difficult to understand, but the philosophy behind our objective is one that he would have accepted: it is for the Government to ensure that the resources of the nation are properly directed to the needs of the nation for which overall, they are responsible. Only by these changes can we ensure that they are. Unless we carry them through, the situation will continue to be as unfair on those who have the greatest need as they have, unfortunately, been for some time.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the view of Cardinal Newman, but I suspect that we might have different opinions about how to reach that goal. I am still unhappy because I know that the local authority associations are unhappy about the unknown factor—particularly future capital receipts. I accept some of the Minister's arguments about the length of the list, although Government Departments have never in the past been frightened to produce long lists for local authorities. They may have been too long.<br><br>
I shall not press the amendment, but I believe that there are considerable defects in the clause. I do not believe that it is possible to forecast as accurately as the Minister suggests what capital receipts—particularly non-housing receipts—are likely to be. Although I shall not press the amendment, I shall call for a Division on clause stand part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>No. 380, in page 54, leave out lines 7 and 8.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition amendments deal with the definition of capital receipts and the matter of new capital receipts to be introduced under the new system as opposed to those already in the kitties of local authorities.<br><br>
The Government's drive has been for local authorities to dispose of more and more of their assets. Some measures have been resisted by Opposition Members for very good reasons. I am very much opposed to the idea of disposal of council land and assets that could be used in future for new developments. We shall reach the point where councils are required to dispose of their unused land and, at a later date, local authorities will be pressurised, when they are allowed to resume their right and proper function, to build new houses, which will be that much more difficult as they will have to pay high prices to replace land that the Government have forced them to sell.<br><br>
I remind Conservative Members that the grander schemes in our city centres, including London, have required an accumulation of land over a long period of time. That land has obviously not been used for the purposes for which it was originally designed, but that does not mean to say that it has not been used or that it is wrong for a local authority to hold a land bank against the expectation of using it later.<br><br>
I would not defend the idea of holding on to land with no prospect of the development that was originally envisaged when it was purchased. For example, the Greater London council inherited from the London county council a series of theatre freeholds in the vicinity of the Aldwych. Those freeholds had been acquired over the years because a number of schemes had been devised for changes. The schemes were subsequently abandoned, but the capital assets were retained and passed on to successor bodies.<br><br>
To be straightforward and honest—I do not want the Minister to accuse me of hoarding for the sake of hoarding—it is right for local authorities to look at their assets at regular intervals to see whether they can be released to raise capital receipts for more immediate works. That happened in the past and should be allowed to continue to happen, but the Government have determined that it will not.<br><br>
Whether it is a good time to sell has nothing to do with the issue. Ministers would not dispose of their overflowing share portfolios at a time that was unpropitious for the capital gains that Ministers slaver over when they contemplate their large share portfolios—which are probably now in the names of their spouses. That is normal, and a perfectly reasonable attitude for them to adopt, but it does not stop them thinking that local authorities should be required to dispose of assets when the Government say they should, even though they will not fetch good market prices or benefit ratepayers.<br><br>
Our amendments show our resentment at the Government's interference in the affairs of local authorities as they relate to assets that belong to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
people to whom local authorities are responsible. This is another example of ideology prevailing over good sense—something to which we have become accustomed after 10 years of this Government.<br><br>
Amendment No. 301 attempts to narrow the definition of capital receipts, giving local authorities greater freedom in the use of moneys received by virtue of the deleted subsections. The retention of such a strict definition of capital receipts is the opposite of circumstances that give rise to spending for capital purposes. Greater local discretion on the use of moneys is required if local authorities are to run their financial affairs efficiently. The amendment suggests a narrower definition of capital receipts. I am aware that I do not have the attention of my Tory Whip colleague but I shall attempt to fill him in on my speech later.<br><br>
Amendment No. 302 would apply to new regimes of used capital receipts for debt redemption to new receipts only, thus honouring previous Government commitments. Would it not be something if we could get the Government to honour their commitments? I speak more in hope than in anticipation. It is worthwhile saying again to the Minister that I assume that these commitments were made in honour. They were accepted by local authorities as being made honourably and fairly. It seems base in the extreme that the Government now seek to desert these commitments.<br><br>
The Minister can hardly look askance at us if we take a somewhat cynical approach to the assurances that he and his colleagues have given in this and other Committees when they said, "It is not our intention to do this" or, "It will not be our intention to do that. Will Opposition Members accept our word?" I recall saying to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) when he gave assurances that, of course, I accepted that he was an honourable man and I was happy to take his word, but I reminded him often that he might be succeeded—and indeed he was, by a string of others. Therefore the assurances that Ministers sometimes give are not worth the air that they use to deliver them or the space on the paper that <i>Hansard</i> uses to record them. We cannot let the Government off when, once again, they have deserted earlier commitments.<br><br>
The Bill does not distinguish between capital receipts generated under the old system and those which will arise under the new system. The reserved part and usable part percentages will apply to all receipts. That goes against previous Government assurances that old system cash-back receipts would be available in full to finance additional capital expenditure. If I may dare to quote the Green Paper, "Paying for Local Government", paragraph 6.40 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities have been given the assurance that this amount (accumulated receipts brought forward from the present system) will be available in full over time to justify additional capital expenditure."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words in the Government's Green Paper and it is the promise that they are now so shamelessly walking away from.<br><br>
Paragraph 11 of the consultation paper "Review of Local Authority Capital Expenditure Control
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0814">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 715</span>
System in England and Wales" (FEG 1986)—a rather snappy title—states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government does, however, envisage that authorities would be able to use in full for capital expenditure that part of those receipts accumulated under the present system which is still backed by cash."</p></blockquote>
The Government should honour those commitments. The Minister will have to give a very good set of reasons in a pathetic attempt to change our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister gives his pathetic reply, may I make several points?</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why it was so difficult to estimate local authorities' future capital receipts, but so easy to be sure that my reply would be full of pathos?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difference lies in the apostrophes.<br><br>
As a Welsh Member you, Sir Anthony, will be aware of some of the issues that I raise. As at 31 March 1989 Welsh district councils estimate that they hold some £170 million worth of cash-back housing capital receipts. By 31 March 1990 cash receipts in hand are likely to be in the order of £200 million. Under the proposals only a quarter of the receipts, £50 million, can be used for new housing investment after March 1990. Under the present cascade principle Welsh districts can utilise three quarters of their receipts, about £150 million, over a seven-year period.<br><br>
In short, Welsh district councils could lose locally produced housing capital spending powers of about £100 million from accumulated receipts in hand at March 1990. From 1990–91 they could lose spending powers of the order of £60 million from each year's annual receipts. If ever there was a reason for spending money on improving council estates through capitalised repairs and on new build it is because 70,000 people in Wales are looking for houses.<br><br>
Wales has a pressing case. The district council treasurers, who are not political, say that 70 or 75 per cent. of capital receipts should be used for new build and repair, not the other way round as the Government propose. I should have thought that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales and his colleagues would present a separate case here as they have done successfully in the next clause. They are to be praised for making a separate case for non-housing capital receipts. But there it is.<br><br>
Will the Minister repeat his explanation for housing capital receipts being used in full, 100 per cent. for capitalised housing repairs and improvements, as opposed to new build? Will that arrangement continue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 380 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). Our amendment is more modest in scope
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 716</span>
than that of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), so its language is more modest.<br><br>
At present the definition of capital receipts includes, under clause 48(5)(b),
<br><blockquote><p>"any sum paid by way of rent more than seven days before the beginning of the rental period to which it relates".</p></blockquote>
If someone pays rent to a local authority more than seven days before it is due, the money apparently becomes a capital receipt, with all the ensuing restrictions and administrative problems.<br><br>
I am sure that it is not the Government's intention to discourage early payment of money due to local authorities. Is my right hon. Friend aware of the anxiety that this drafting has caused some local authorities? Can he tell them that they will not have to count as capital receipts rent paid more than seven days before it is due? Otherwise, is he prepared to accept our modest amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments rightly brings together a series of different thoughts, and I shall take them one by one.<br><br>
Amendment No. 301 would remove from the definition of capital receipts any sums that are repayments of grants or advances, or which are the proceeds of the disposal of investments. Capital receipts would be more or less restricted to the proceeds of sales of capital assets. That is nonsense. It is a complete mis-statement of what capital receipt could be.<br><br>
When a local authority makes a loan to someone in support of capital investment by that person, the loan is capital expenditure. It cannot be anything else. The local authority can borrow for it, and no doubt often will. When the loan is repaid, the repayment plainly should be a capital receipt and should be subject to the debt redemption provisions that we shall discuss in the next clauses. Amendment No. 301 does not make sense and cannot be accepted.<br><br>
Repayments of capital grants and advances have always been capital receipts, even under the present capital control system. There has never been any objection to that. If the Opposition do not think that such repayments should be capital receipts, why have they not argued it before? The answer is because they think that they should be capital receipts. They want to escape the requirement to set sums aside as provision for capital liabilities. That does not surprise me.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) was charming in his description of what my answer might be. He will not like my answer, because it is more sharp and direct than prophetic. Obviously, the hon. Gentleman wants to avoid the responsibility, because the Labour party always does. It believes in live now and pay later, or leave it for someone else to pay, especially if payment can be put off until I am not around. The hon. Gentleman should read the published letter from the leader of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham who positively drooled over the possibility of borrowing. He said that borrowing was a good thing and should be done as far ahead as possible because future generations should be loaded with the cost of today's Socialist programme.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0815">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 717</span>
I am surprised that amendment No. 301 seeks only to remove grants and advances from receipts and not from everything else. That is precisely what characterised the policies of the Greater London council and other authorities. The Labour party does not believe in responsibility, but it is needed. The Labour party must be reminded that when things are bought and sold, the first responsibility is to pay back the money that is borrowed. It would be wrong to leave out the lines in the clause. Broadly, the clause makes no change in the present definition of capital receipts. That is why the hon. Gentleman's argument fails.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am attempting not to redefine capital receipts, but to restrict the different categories of capital receipts to those that relate specifically to the sale of assets in the first part of the clause.<br><br>
There has been some redefinition, which the Minister touched on, and I should be grateful if he would explain precisely what it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Gentleman's argument is that for the purposes of the clauses, that which is known to be a capital receipt shall not be a capital receipt. That concept is unacceptable. It is odd to try to distinguish between one kind of capital receipt and another, not because of the difference in the nature of the capital receipt but to avoid the reasonable discipline in the clause.<br><br>
The proceeds of sales of tangible assets and investments and the repayments of capital grants and advances are included under capital receipts as they have always been. In that sense, we have been consistent. But other measures go further and meet some of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised.<br><br>
Amendment No. 302 suggests that capital receipts from the existing system should not be subject to the debt redemption provisions of the new system. They should instead be wholly available for capital spending. The implications of that arrangement should be understood. They are direct.<br><br>
First, we expect £8,000 million capital receipts at the end of the present system. Under our proposals, nearly £3,000 million of them will be available for spending. The remainder will be set aside for debt redemption. The amendment would mean that an extra £5,000 million would be available for spending. Not all that would be spent, but a fair amount would be. That would leave the Government with two options: either to expand the money taken into account for capital spending—and say, in effect, that the nation would spend that amount extra—or compensate by cutting credit approvals. The difficulty with compensating in that way is that it would make even less direct the connection between need and ability to make capital spending. The purpose is to give to each according to his need and to expect from each according to his ability. But the amendment would take from each irrespective of need and give to each irrespective of ability.<br><br>
I should tell the hon. Member for Newham, North-West that that is not what I understand to be the reasonable approach for those whose connection with Karl Marx is closer than mine. I suspect that he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 718</span>
would not like that. The alternative is to say, "It is perfectly all right. Spend the lot." That may seem a happy way to solve the problem, except that it is precisely the approach that has led to our economic problems over many years. The idea that spending can go on and not be paid back has been a fueller of inflation and a creater of economic decline.<br><br>
Any Government worth their salt must restrict the total amount of capital spending. In this instance, we are anxious to do so in a way that ensures that those who most need it, get it rather than allow such vagaries as their location, where they have been able to sell and the opportunities afforded to them by past generations to dictate all. We have attempted to strike a balance.<br><br>
The proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Newham, North-West is unacceptable. I say that with considerable sadness. His comments are somewhat hollow, when I recall the 45 per cent. cut in real terms in capital spending by local authorities imposed by his Government between 1974 and 1979. We are talking about applying £3,000 million from capital receipts—not of imposing a 45 per cent. cut—to the seedcorn of the future. The hon. Gentleman was unusually reticent in not referring to that. Surely he should have wished to do so to ensure that the record was right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One reason why I did not do so is that I prefer more recent history. I hasten to add that I do not prefer it in qualitative terms, but simply because it is more relevant than going further back—lamentably, for the moment—in time. Sooner or later the Government must accept that, having been in office for 10 years, it is threadbare to refer back to something that many of us who are so young cannot even remember. That is perhaps fortuitous.<br><br>
The real evil of borrowing is paying back; that is certain. But what makes the evil doubly unacceptable is the usurious rates of interest that one has to pay. It would have been very sensible and pleasant if the Government had brought down the level of interest rates to the point where local authorities could borrow money and spend it without imposing a huge burden on future generations. The level of interest rates is clearly a crucial element when considering whether to borrow. That is a matter which the Government should tackle.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The real evil of borrowing is that it enables people to believe that they can get owt for nowt: that they can pass on to some future generation the cost of what they are doing. The good of it is that it enables them to buy and use a worthwhile asset over a period of time. We must seek a balance between the good and the evil.<br><br>
The problem that we have had for many years is that some authorities believed that as long as money could be borrowed, it could be spent, and that as long as someone else would pay for it later on, it did not matter: someone else would relieve them of the burden. That arises precisely from the belief that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has just expounded: that all the Government have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0816">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 719</span>
do is say, "we will lower interest rates," as if interest rates were some artificial device unconnected with the cost of the money.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West does not understand that money is a commodity, the cost of which varies according to its availability, the circumstances in which it is wanted and the creditworthiness of the person who wants to borrow it. He does not understand that aspect of money and worships it because he believes that it is somehow different from anything else. That is why the hon. Gentleman insists on taking the line that he does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is palpable economic nonsense for the Minister to say that there is a free market in interest rates when the Government interfere continually and use interest rates as a way of controlling inflation. There is no shortage of money, as if it were a question of apples on the tree. There is a hell of a lot of it slopping around in the City, as anyone who wants to borrow knows. If the perfect market economy applied to interest rates, they would be plummeting now, thanks to the easy availability of money. The Minister should learn some of the basic rules of economics. I shall lend him Sir Alec Douglas-Home's boxes of matches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now have my weekend speech. I shall tell my constituents that the Labour party thinks that there is no shortage of money, so we shall be back at the "spend, spend, spend and let someone else pick up the mess afterwards" position if the Labour party ever gets back into office. That is why the Labour party will never be re-elected, because people know that it takes this outdated and unacceptable approach adopted by no other Socialist party in Western Europe. No other Socialist in any European country could have made that speech. It is a uniquely British phenomenon.<br><br>
I must answer the point that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West made earlier about how our performance has measured against our assurance. We estimated that between April 1987 and April 1990, local authorities would spend some £8.5 million from receipts and take another £3 billion into the new system as useable capital receipts. That makes £11.5 billion altogether, which is not bad against £3 billion that we guaranteed. Far from failing to meet our obligations, we promised that £3 billion would be available for additional capital spending, and we have ensured that £11.5 million is available. If all assurances were met so fully, most of us would have a clear conscience on such matters.<br><br>
When I first saw amendment No. 303 I was impressed by the research that must have gone into it and it seems to contain a comprehensive list of payments. But my officials have informed me that the amount of research may be less than meets the eye. The list has been lifted from schedule 2 of the prescribed expenditure regulations in the existing system. It is a list of the sums that are treated as capital receipts by virtue of regulations. If the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) were in the Committee I would tell him that his advisers should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 720</span>
have used an updated copy of the prescribed expenditure regulations. The list in the amendment was taken from regulations made on 17 December 1987. If the hon. Gentleman wishes, I shall send him a copy of the regulations made on 6 September 1988 in which he will see that the Manpower Services Commission is referred to as the training commission and that the Council for Educational Technology is now the National Council for Educational Technology. The amendments would not be possible, even if they were advisable.<br><br>
The amendment would remove the power to amend the definition of capital receipts by regulations. That would be unwise because accounting procedures and practices change and we have always had the power to amend the definition of capital receipts by regulations, even under the present system. We have sometimes used it because local authorities have asked us to do so. It would be odd not to have that power.<br><br>
The amendment would also delete subsection (7) which provides that the provisions on capital receipts have effect on some disposals, payments and repayments occurring before 1 April 1990. I made clear on the previous amendment the importance of capital receipts in the existing system.<br><br>
Finally, the amendment takes the list from existing regulations and states that payments made by the organisations on that list
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be regarded as capital receipts".</p></blockquote>
That is unnecessary because such payments would not be capital receipts. To say that payments that are not capital receipts shall not be regarded as capital receipts is otiose.<br><br>
Under amendment No. 380, if a local authority disposed of a leasehold interest, a sum paid by way of rent would not be a capital receipt unless the rental period was more than one year. The provision is difficult and, as drafted, may cause anxiety. It is an attempt to stop an abuse of the system, but I shall be happy to refer to a period of more than seven days if there is a way of doing so without getting into the sort of mess to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) referred when discussing the problem of three-year leases in the London borough of Ealing. He will understand that under some mechanisms, the use of rent may be an effective means of avoiding controls. If my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment, I shall be happy to try to find a way round the difficulty, if there is such a difficulty, and to table another amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether he feels any shame or guilt that the assurances in Government documents on the way in which capital receipts would be treated will not be honoured?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had explained that. We gave an assurance of £3.5 billion and allowed £11.5 billion. I am quite happy about that. It is unnecessary to make another excuse. We have provided between three and four times the amount that we promised. Our promise has been fulfilled, pressed down and is running over.<br><br>

Government amendment No. 189 is a technical drafting amendment. Subsection 1(c) covers sums received by a local authority that are
<br><blockquote><p>"repayment of, or a payment in respect of, any grants or other financial assistance"</p></blockquote>
given by the authority. It is spelt out in the first line of paragraph (c) that the sum may be a repayment or a payment. But line 19, which refers to the time when the sum is received, refers only to a repayment. This amazingly important amendment corrects that and I hope that it will not be a matter for controversy.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, who has now left the Room, gets away with murder. He talked about cuts in capital expenditure in the past 10 years and before but forgot to mention the base from which those cuts were made. However, let us consider what happened in 1978. In that year, my local authority received about £1.9 million in its housing investment programme. In 1989, 11 years later, it receives £1.5 million in its housing investment programme allocation. Taking inflation and the retail price index into consideration, the 1978 figure must, by comparison, be worth about £5 million now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is digging himself into a deep pit. It is a matter of fact, as stated by Lord Barnett of Heywood and Royton, that during each of the final three years that the Labour party was in government, between 1976 and 1979, housing expenditure was cut. When I made that point in a recent housing debate on the Floor of the House, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) conceded it.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that the Labour Government cut expenditure in the late 1970s. What I was saying is that the cuts that have taken place since 1979 have been horrific compared with those of the late 1970s. The Government have cut approximately 60 per cent. of housing finance since 1979. That is the base from which we lead. I am ashamed that cuts took place under my Government, but I am more ashamed of what the Conservative Government have done to housing authorities in the past 10 years.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures that the hon. Gentleman has just given are the housing investment programme allocations, and they exclude capital receipts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that also, but in 1980, the Government guaranteed that local authority expenditure would be maintained by the use of capital receipts. From 1980 onwards, there has been a decline in the use of capital receipts. Local authorities have come to depend upon them. Current expenditure with capital receipts is still less than the total HIP allocation in the late 1970s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might like to remind the Under-Secretary that the hon. Gentleman's photograph appeared in the Building Materials Producers annual report for 1988–89. If he had read it, he would have seen on page 8 a graph headed?
<br><blockquote><p>"Public expenditure in real terms, by department".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend might not wish to go through each figure for each year but the line on the graph clearly goes down in the past few years after the years which my hon. Friend mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Spending on what?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Spending on housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention clearly supports the view that I have expressed, and that my hon. Friends have expressed for the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary thinks that the cuts are a joke.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister does not think that they are a joke. He is just sadly misinformed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can give the hon. Gentleman time to recover his composure and to try to follow the graph, which I have seen.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), who participated in the debate in the House that I mentioned earlier, will recall that the more extreme members of the parliamentary Labour party acknowledged that dramatic cuts had taken place. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and I wish to point out that during that time of the Labour Government, no capital receipts from the exercise of the right to buy were coming in because we know what the Labour Government thought about that right.<br><br>
In Durham, for the most recent year, a total allocation of £2.2 million was supplemented by £4.2 million of spending power from receipts, making £6.4 million in all. That is the figure to compare with 1978, as my hon. Friend said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not disputed the fact that allocations have been supplemented by capital receipts, but capital receipts have been consistently reduced since the early 1980s, and now there is less
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 724</span>
money available for spending than there was in the late 1970s. The graph shows that in the early 1980s, local authorities had about £3.5 billion to spend in real terms. The figure is now down to just over £2 billion. It must be nice to be handed briefs from people who do not exist.<br><br>
Bearing in mind the figures that have been given to the Committee by me and by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) there can be no justification for the proposal to reserve a huge percentage of housing capital receipts. If the Bill is not amended, local authorities will be empowered to spend only 25 per cent. of their housing capital receipts on a once-and-for-all basis.<br><br>
The cascade principle of rolling forward unused capital receipts is to be stopped, making the spending power of capital receipts derisory. Local authorities will be able to spend only 25 per cent. of their capital receipts in one year, whereas at present they can spend 20 per cent. of accumulated capital receipts, which each year cascade onto the next. Local authorities will experience a massive reduction in their capital expenditure powers.<br><br>
When the right to buy was introduced by the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 the Government promised local authorities that they would be allowed to spend the receipts from the sale of council houses for housing purposes. The initial prescribed proportion of capital receipts from right-to-buy sales was split at 50 per cent.<br><br>
In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy on 15 October 1980, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir J. Stanley), who was then Minister for Housing and Construction, said of capital receipts:
<br><blockquote><p>"These new rules will give local authority Treasurers a major contribution to make in realising their authorities' housing objectives. If a council has a shrewd, sophisticated and enterprising Director of Finance he will be worth his weight in gold to the council's Housing Committee."</p></blockquote>
He certainly will not be worth his weight in gold now.<br><br>
Later in his speech the right hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Council A wants to build an elderly person's warden scheme costing £500,000 but cannot afford to do so within its HIP allocation. However it happens to own a piece of land, near its town centre, which has been unused for years but which is suitable for commercial use. It decides to sell the land with the benefit of a planning consent for shopping. The capital receipts amount to nearly £500,000. Under the new rules it can be credited in full to the authority's HIP and the warden scheme is able to proceed."</p></blockquote>
Why, oh why have the rules been changed so dramatically since 1980? Why was it OK in 1980 but not now? I should dearly like the Minister to tell us.<br><br>
The percentage has been gradually eroded until it is now down to 20 per cent. The proposal allowing 25 per cent. of receipts from disposals tobe used may appear to represent an increase, but with the cessation of the cascade principle on the unused balance, that is not so. Furthermore, the Bill gives authorities no power to continue to use 100 per cent. of receipts from the sale of low-cost home ownership schemes, knows as starter homes.<br><br>
There will not only a reduction in available funds, but a strong disincentive to the future provision of such accommodation. My authority and, I am sure,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0819">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 725</span>
many others generated income from building low-cost starter homes and using 100 per cent. of the capital receipts from their sale to build further houses. That will no longer happen because capital receipts cannot be used for further low-cost housing.<br><br>
The low spending power proposed for most housing capital receipts is purely political. It is designed to ensure inadequate expenditure on the provision of dwellings and the maintenance and improvement of existing stock. Thus, the level of service offered by local authorities may deteriorate to such an extent that the provisions of the Housing Act 1988 may begin to bite. It is not, as the Minister suggested, aimed at meeting individual needs. There is a political and vindictive motive behind it.<br><br>
Under the new system, the scope for local authority investment in housing will be severely reduced. Authorities will lose interest on the 75 per cent. of receipts that will have to go towards debt redemption and will, over time, lose even the interest earned on the useable portion of their receipts. In many cases, there will be a substantial loss of income, which will not be compensated for by savings on interest repayments from debt redemption. Many local authority debts are repayable on low fixed rates of interest. Local authorities should be allowed the freedom to decide how to manage their historic debts.<br><br>
The report on recent research commissioned by the Department of the Environment, "The Nature and Effects of Housing Management in England", in 1989, quoted earlier today, has dispelled the myth that local authorities are badly managed and customer-insensitive. There is no justification for the severe spending restrictions on capital receipts that the Government are proposing. Squeezing investment in public housing makes no economic sense. It contradicts the Government's objective of prudent financial management. If properties are not properly maintained or improved, future bills to make good will be gigantic; they are big enough now.<br><br>
Various organisations have argued for capital investment. The Audit Commission's report, "Capital Expenditure Controls in Local Government in England" said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Capital assets are being run down as a consequence of the present control system; and that more investment most notably in housing renovation, appeared necessary to compensate for the failure to maintain assets in the past."</p></blockquote>
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors has argued that substantial new investment is needed in all three housing sectors.<br><br>
Because HIP has been so dramatically cut, local authorities have come to depend on accumulated capital receipts, being able to spend on a cascade principle. Durham city council has depended on that for the past eight or nine years. Under the new rules, it will be in serious trouble. I suspect that many other local authorities will be in a similar situation. Ministers may believe that it may not be too bad for some authorities. It should be remembered that an area of land in a northern district that sold for thousands of pounds could go for millions in the south.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now the hon. Gentleman is getting to it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 726</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Consequently, the smaller northern authorities will be badly hit by the new regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see the joke. I know that people living in council houses in Durham do not find it funny when their roofs leak, nor when they wake in the morning to find ice on their windows because they have no central heating. They do not find it funny to be told that their houses have structural faults that would cost them thousands of pounds to put right. If the hon. Gentleman were to go to the north-east and try to give them a good laugh about it, he would be told where to go in no uncertain terms.<br><br>
The consultation paper "Capital Expenditure and Finance" made much of the fact that local authority borrowings had grown to £45 billion by the end of 1987, but from what level was not stated, nor was it said whether they were excessive. The assertion that local authority debt is a problem has to be challenged. As a proportion of gross domestic product, local authority borrowing fell from 1.4 per cent. in 1980–81 to 1 per cent. in 1985–86. Over the same period, local authority long-term debt as a proportion of GDP fell from 15 per cent. to 13 per cent. Loans outstanding as a proportion of gross annual revenue expenditure fell from 135 per cent. in 1980–81 to 117 per cent. in 1986–87.<br><br>
Within a constrained level of gross capital expenditure, a reduction in the reversed part and consequently an increase in the usable part of capital receipts will lead to a reduction in the amount or credit approvals available for distribution. In determining the percentages to be applied in respect of reserved and usable receipts, the Government have to balance the twin objectives of providing an incentive for authorities to dispose of assets and of maintaining a level of credit approvals sufficient to direct sources to areas of greatest need. The Minister must explain the balance he has chosen.<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
In proposing the percentages of 75 per cent. and 50 per cent. as the reserved part, the Government set out in the consultation paper, "Capital Expenditure and Finance", the factors they had in mind in arriving at these figures. They were that accumulated tax receipts at 31 March 1990 could be as high as £8 billion, which would provide spending power of £2.8 billion in 1990–91; that the level of new receipts in 1990–91 would provide spending power of £1 billion; and that the need to provide within public expenditure plans an adequate level of credit approvals. What does the Minister regard as an adequate level for credit approvals? I hope that he will answer that question.<br><br>
Prudent and financial management dictates that a first call on receipts from the sale of assets is the repayment of any debt outstanding on that asset, otherwise an authority's balance sheet will show a deferred charge to balance the loan outstanding for which there is no longer any corresponding asset. That authorities have followed this prudent approach
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0820">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 727</span>
is evidenced from the fact that 26 per cent. of capital receipts generated since 1981–82 have been used for debt repayment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 306 does not accept the proportions for the reserved part of capital receipts set out in clause 49. It is aimed at making the Government acknowledge the matching principle and requires a higher proportion to be specified if this is necessary to extinguish outstanding debt. The Minister must tell us why he is encouraging authorities to move away from the matching principle which, in the past, has been regarded as sound financial management.<br><br>
We have tabled amendment No. 308 because there will be circumstances where authorities will have paid off all outstanding debt by applying their reserved part of capital receipts. In such cases an authority should be permitted to use 100 per cent. of its capital receipts to finance additional expenditure. If this power is not granted, what will happen to those receipts? Will they simply be allowed to grow and grow?<br><br>
In the consultation paper, "Capital Expenditure and Finance", the Government acknowledged that there would be cases where authorities had realised receipts to such an extent that those set aside for debt redemption or to meet future commitments exceeded both the authority's existing debt and its foreseeable programme of new investment. That might arise, for example, in a district housing authority which transferred its housing stock to the private sector. The consultation paper envisaged that the district concerned should have access to the surplus receipts to finance capital expenditure to be carried out by a county council, or other statutory agencies or public bodies for the benefit of the area concerned.<br><br>
The proposal to transfer capital receipts to another tier of local government, or indeed to another public body, appears not to have been carried through the Bill. If the Government have now dropped it, which they seem to have done, how is the problem of surplus receipts to be managed?<br><br>
I am sorry to go on for so long but this is perhaps one of the most important clauses in the Bill. It will be the life and death of many local authorities in terms of housing expenditure, housing capital, building and modernising houses, capitalised repairs and building new houses. The clause must be taken seriously, which is why I have spoken for so long.<br><br>
Finally, clause 49(3) gives the Secretary of State regulatory powers to alter the percentages applying to the reserve part of capital receipts. Different provision may be made for different descriptions of receipts and local authorities. What is more, receipts and authorities may be differentiated in any manner which appears to the Secretary of State to be appropriate. What differentiation criteria does the Minister have in mind?<br><br>
The Opposition are wholly opposed to the Secretary of State having the power to amend the usable proportion of capital receipts by regulation, especially over the full percentage range. I have shown how he has reduced the prescribed proportion
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
of capital receipts from right-to-buy sales under the current rules from 50 per cent. to 20 per cent. He should not be allowed the same freedom in future.<br><br>
The clause gives the Secretary of State too much power. The Minister must explain to the Committee what differentiation he has in mind. We have a right to know, as do local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to the amendments that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) have tabled.<br><br>
First, amendments Nos. 323 and 325 would reduce the figure from 75 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively to nil per cent. In principle, the restrictions should not exist in any form and nil per cent. is the only appropriate figure for the accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman so I wish him to clarify this. Is not the logic of nil per cent. that authorities with high housing need but no receipts would have little opportunity to do much about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: National investment by central Government is needed in those areas. Tower Hamlets is one area about which Ministers may accept the argument to some extent, but not yet far enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman say through which of the seven different heads of finance in Tower Hamlets he would like the investment to be channelled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is witty, but not terribly helpful. He knows the seriousness of the difficulties in Tower Hamlets and has had meetings about them. He knows that, whatever else, help is needed, although he may disagree on the extent of such help and how to tackle the problems.<br><br>
People in small villages in my county have seen the total of the housing stock that has been sold. They ask the council why it is building many fewer council houses than in the past. The answer is, in effect, "We are not allowed to build more. The money from Government is drying up. The money that we realise from council house sales"—that is, those houses that are no longer available to rent, as the council would wish—"is being locked up by the Government and is not available to spend." People feel strongly about that. They cannot understand the logic and, in principle, they are right to object to it.<br><br>
I tabled amendment No. 324 because I know that however strongly I feel about that principle, Ministers are unlikely to agree. I ask them to consider accepting a figure of 50 per cent., as they have done in subsection (2)(b), for any other receipts. The Ministers seem unduly influenced by the Treasury in setting the figure. It is not a fair reflection of the value of those assets to the local authorities and their housing needs or of what Ministers have previously said about local authorities' ability to spend their receipts.<br><br>
The figure of 50 per cent. would go a long way towards meeting those objections. The Government's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0821">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 729</span>
new policy of 25 per cent. clamps down far beyond what is necessary, even in the economic terms that the Minister may be inclined to justify. I believe that the undue influence of the Treasury, rather than innate meanness on the part of Ministers, has led to the adoption of that figure. I hope that Ministers, or at least the Back-Bench Government men, will support this change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Boys!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend refers to them as boys, but it would be extremely unwise for me to do so. If my hon. and learned Friend wishes to make a speech, it will come well from him. I am inclined to take my revenge by saying that it would come well from him in respect of any Conservative Member, but that would probably be unfair.<br><br>
On amendment No. 326, the powers in subsections (3) to (5) are draconian. They give the Minister an awesome power to juggle the figures between 0 and 100 per cent. Perhaps I have misunderstood the provision—I should be delighted if the Minister could correct me. As far as I can see, the Minister will be able to alter the percentage without the positive approval of the House, and juggle it between local authorities, between kinds of capital receipts and between years. Such power should not be given to any Secretary of State. I would certainly not give it to the present Secretary of State.<br><br>
I am not sure whether I have achieved what I set out to do in amendment No. 327 but, if not, the Minister will no doubt correct me. I believe that the principle of the amendment is right. A council may carry out improvements to properties that it plans to dispose of later, and invest in them specifically to enhance their value. I wanted to ensure that when the capital receipts are calculated, the council will not be penalised for the money that it has invested to increase the value of those assets before disposing of them. For example, a council may spend £100,000 to improve the value of a block of flats before selling it, and may realise £400,000. It should not be penalised for having made that investment, rather than selling the flats earlier and making much less because of the condition that they were in.<br><br>
The amendment tries to construct a formula that would allow that, without letting rip and destroying the controls that the Minister seeks to impose. The amendment stands separately. My fears may be unfounded, or there may be another way of tackling the problem. It is possible that the amendment will not work technically, but I believe that the principle is right and I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.<br><br>
The amendments are reasonable. Two of them are on matters of principle, and I hope that the Minister will accept them. I believe that the others stand up in principle and in practice, and I hope that the Committee will accept that they are on the right lines and that they introduce changes that should be incorporated into the Bill.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be briefer than the hon. Members who have spoken so far. This is an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
important part of the Bill and I know that my hon. Friends will want to hear why I tabled amendment No. 359.<br><br>
The background to clause 49 has already been explained, although I would take a slightly different line. I understand that the Government's main aim is to target housing assistance to the areas with the most severe housing need. I judge that that aim will be shared by all members of the Committee, even if there would be a difference of opinion about the way in which to achieve it. It is an improvement on what was rumoured a year ago when there was talk of cash transfers from one authority to another. It is right for us to recognise that what may have gone before the clause has been rightly dismissed.<br><br>
I have no central objection to the Government's proposals—nor does the Institute of Housing on whose behalf I am making my comments. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The principle is fine; indeed the proposal has a number of strengths."</p></blockquote>
However, it highlights a central and, perhaps, obvious weakness which is the speed of transfer—the immediacy of change of system. It has cited three examples, but in the interests of time, I shall quote only one. They are examples of local authorities that are presently rich in housing receipts, but which under the new system, making level assumptions, will be losers immediately, having little opportunity to make adjustments.<br><br>
Sedgefield district council states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of the council's capital receipts have accrued from council house sales and in future the biggest share will have to be used for debt redemption. The councils overall spending will probably fall sharply in 1990/91 with a possible reduction in the spending power over 1989/90 of 60 per cent."</p></blockquote>
That is a substantial figure. Those of us who have served on local authorities will understand how significant that figure is on a year-on-year basis. It is with that in mind and given the nature and wording of my amendment, that I hesitate to say that it represents the only option open to the Government. I have sought to table a progression to take us from where we are now to a time when we would reach the Government's target of 75 per cent. after about four or five years. I am not saying that the amendment is absolutely right, but I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to explain how he expects the system to cope with the considerable problems that some authorities will face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate and, as we are pressed for time, I shall be as brief as I can. The clause has been the subject of amendments from the Opposition, somewhat tediously presented by the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg), amendments tabled by the Social and Liberal Democrats and the amendment just spoken to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), who was mercifully brief.<br><br>
I can claim to be the only Conservative Member in the Committee, and possibly during the whole of the Second Reading debate, who devoted most of my speech to this dilemma. I referred to the problems that this clause and those surrounding it will cause to housing authorities that are efficiently run in shire county areas. I leave aside the inner-city areas.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0822">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
Although I do not concur with the precise aspirations of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor)—he was a little sweeping in his requirements—I go with his gist. As a fellow south-western Member, he will know of the problems faced by local authorities in rural and semi-rural areas. On Second Reading I was chided by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) for representing a rural area but Taunton is substantially urban and even elects Labour councillors.<br><br>
My local authority has always been irritated by the limits on the use of capital receipts and it is especially disturbed by the proposals in clause 49. As far as I can see, after 1990 they would effectively end the use of capital receipts from previous housing sales. I gave figures on Second Reading that showed that my local authority sold between 20 and 25 per cent. of its 1980 council housing stock and accrued capital receipts of about £14 million. Those are the sort of sums that we are discussing and under the present regime that they are most useful, so there is great concern about where local authorities will go after 1990.<br><br>
I am encouraged by the signs of flexibility shown by Ministers in previous debates and I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister has had a meeting in Taunton Deane. I hope that the regulations will show that there has been movement on those matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about the position in the hon. Gentleman's area, but in Cornwall the building of council housing in the whole county at present is equivalent to what was previously built in one district. The impact on a rural area is that if one or two houses in some villages are sold, no rented accommodation is left. That is why people in my constituency feel so strongly about an authority's ability to reinvest that money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Both he and the Minister will be aware that there is a particular difficulty in the south-west where council homes have to be knocked down because of non-traditional build. I refer to Cornish units and others. Therefore, the resources of those authorities are significantly concentrated on replacing those types of homes.<br><br>
I shall describe the various elements of the dilemma that prevents local authorities from meeting their statutory requirements. First, there is the role of the private rented sector, a matter that was discussed on Second Reading. I believe that in inner cities there is scope for the expansion of the private rented sector, but in the areas that I am discussing that scope is very limited because existing homes cannot be made available for private renting. I wonder what rents would need to be charged for any new build for private renting because of the current cost of land and construction.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the possible development of housing assoiciations. But an authority that has sold its holdings of land, as mine has, does not have land to offer such associations as an inducement to move in.<br><br>
Thirdly, in referring to my local authority and many others in the south-west and elsewhere, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
are not talking about authorities which have large numbers of council homes that are not let for significant parts of the year. We are talking about housing authorities which run their affairs as tightly and efficiently as they can. As I mentioned on Second Reading, I, as a Member of Parliament, face the prospect—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but we are pressed for time.<br><br>
I am faced with the prospect of having to pass on two constituents who are highly rated with 80 or 90 points on the waiting list. They will have an indefinite wait until they can be rehoused, so I ask the Minister to tell us from where the homes at reasonable cost are to come to meet that need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must conclude my remarks. I do not support sweeping figures that are not only rigid in themselves but, presumably, would apply throughout the country. Any limits contained in the provisions should have regard first to the efficiency of operation of a local authority. I have referred to vacancies and rent arrears.<br><br>
Secondly, the limits should take into account the council house sales that have already taken place. There is an enormous difference between 20 per cent. and 2 or 3 per cent., as happened in Camden, Islington and other such authorities. Thirdly, the limits should have regard to the expansion forecasts in the private rented sector. I concur that the Government rely on them in the metropolitan areas, but I do not know from where the expansion will come in the immediate period. I hope that the Minister will respond to those issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow such a spirited speech. I reiterate my question whether 100 per cent. capital receipts will still be used for capitalised housing repairs and improvements? My second point refers to economic developments and non-housing capital receipts. The clause will allow 50 per cent. usage of non-housing capital receipts. For some years, that has been the case in Wales, but not in England where the usage is currently 30 per cent., and will be subject to a 20 per cent. increase. I do not understand why England should not increase proportionately in line with Wales, and why its usage of non-housing capital receipts should not be 70 per cent. at least.<br><br>
Will the Minister clarify the position of Government agencies, which have been urged and exhorted by the Government to sell their property? For example, the Welsh Development Agency has been told by the Welsh Office to sell some of its property. Whether that is right or wrong is not at issue, but the agency has been allowed rightly to retain 100 per cent. of those receipts for redevelopment purposes and economic regeneration in Wales. If such rules can apply to a Government agency, why can they not apply to a local authority? After all, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0823">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
all have the same aim, which is economic development for Wales, England and Scotland. I should be grateful if the Minister will answer those questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I start on the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg), I must assure him that I like him enormously. At the risk of damaging his reselection process, I must say that I greatly respect many of his contributions to our proceedings. I must tell him that, because of his constituency, he is the last person who should have moved the amendment on behalf of the official Opposition. It was not his fault, but that of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). Few constituencies in the whole of the country stand to gain more from the Bill's provisions, especially those on housing, than City of Durham. We have not even started to discuss the new housing subsidy, but Durham, Leeds, Knowsley and many other constituencies will benefit from the Bill.<br><br>
We accept that, in the midlands and the north, it will be that much more difficult for capital receipts to be drawn down through the right-to-buy exercise. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right when he said that the cost of the homes that will be acquired will be cheaper in that part of the country than in the south. That makes it even more staggering why the hon. Gentleman was asked, presumably by the hon. Member for Hammersmith, to lead the onslaught on the clause. It should have been left to the instant Whip. I could have understood such an argument being advanced by a hon. Member who represents a London borough, which is enjoying high capital receipts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that he is yet again getting himself a reputation as a used car salesman? He is saying that because his last customer has not been back to complain, we can trust him. We have put forward an hon. Member who has moved the amendment extremely well; he speaks nationally for the Labour party, and quite right, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not complaining about the way in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment—his delivery and the way that he puts the words together is superb. Under normal circumstances, I often find his smooth and engaging chatter compelling. But the fact that the hon. Gentleman is leading for the Opposition in this debate while he represents the City of Durham is nonsense. I have to make the political point that the city of Durham, which he is wont to praise on every conceivable occasion, does not have a good record with the present system. In the financial year 1988–89 which has just ended, the local authority of the hon. Member for City of Durham underspent on its permitted capital spending by £1.85 million.</span></p>
<p>7.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is simply because the council has to consider the amount of capital receipts left to follow on for the next year. Not only has it to plan repairs and new build, it has to maintain its work force. If a council spent every single pound of its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
capital receipts and capital expenditure allowances in one year, there would be nought left for the next year and the council would have to pay redundancies and so on.<br><br>
Local authorities have to plan their capital receipts carefully over a number of years so that their schemes can come to fruition. By bringing in these provisions, the Minister will ensure that there will be redundancies in local authorities and also that no housebuilding or modernisation will take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was complete nonsense. Durham City council underspent by nearly £2 million, and that was 50 per cent. of the sum that they drew down in capital receipts. It is a disgrace. If the hon. Gentlemen were trying to convince the Committee that a margin of 10 per cent. should be allowed for the contingencies that he has outlined, I might find his argument more compelling, but 50 per cent. is another matter.<br><br>
Let us go through the figures: allocations to Durham city council totalled £2.2 million and available receipts, totalled £4.2 million. That makes a total of £6.4 million and expenditure totalled only £4.55 million.<br><br>
The truth is that under the present arrangements—I suspect under any—there are a number of authorities which are not efficient in using the system that the hon. Gentleman was so quick to praise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister also care to quote the figures for the proposed expenditure for Durham city council for the next financial year, bearing in mind its present position? It has now put forward a programme of some £8 million or £9 million, and has to spend the money because, if it does not, it will lose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As Mandy Rice-Davies might have said, "They would say that, wouldn't they?" The authority would obviously come forward asking to spend as much money as possible. One would expect nothing else, certainly not from the city of Durham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister advocating that every local authority should spend the maximum amount of its capital receipts in one year and thereby leave itself with nothing for the next year? The Government have reneged on promises on HIP allocations that they have made over the years, and local authorities have to be careful in what they spend of their capital receipts so that they have something left for the following financial year. The Minister is now advocating that they should spend every penny in one year and have nothing left.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is nothing unusual for Durham. The choice is for the Committee and you, Sir Anthony, as to how long we should sit discussing the past record, never mind the present one, of the city of Durham. The hon. Gentleman has to be reminded that the city of Durham can spend 100 per cent. of its capital receipts on capitalised repairs. The hon. Member for Torfaen, at least, understands that. If the authority is complaining to the Department of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0824">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
the Environment that its stock is not in an adequate condition, it should be spending 100 per cent. of its capital receipts on those repairs. We all know that it is allowed to spend 20 per cent. on new build, but it has chosen not to do so. The hon. Gentleman has got himself into a corner.<br><br>
I return to my original point. I predict that the local authorities of the hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) stand to gain from the new financial regime on local government provision and the new housing subsidy. Why on earth has the AMA been so reticent in criticising these parts of the Bill? It has been slow to criticise them.<br><br>
Another mistake made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith was to seek someone from the north to represent Her Majesty's Opposition in leading the onslaught on the Bill. The Opposition are in an incredibly difficult position. They are embarrassed by the proposals. They know that the more difficult urban and industrial areas have been treated unfairly in the past because they have not drawn down as many capital receipts as some areas in the south. The hon. Member for Knowsley, North will not mind my saying that he is nodding assent. That is a fact of life. The Department of the Environment has tried to correct the balance by making available special housing schemes, such as estate action, to supplement the money that is being drawn down by local authorities in the form of housing receipts. I suggest—I hope to carry the hon. Member for City of Durham with me—that that is not the way to proceed. We have not yet come to that part of the Bill when we shall consider the implications of the new housing subsidy, but I assure the Committee that the new system will be a darn sight better than the present one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned my area. Does he have the figures of the request by Wakefield council for HIP allocation and the amount that was allocated by the Department of the Environment: Does he have the figures for the number of people who are waiting for grants to improve private property? Does he have the figures on the number of houses in Wakefield that need attention under the Housing Defects Act 1984. Wakefield was allowed £170,000 as a supplementary payment, but that will cover approximately 10 houses only of the massive number that require attention under that Act.<br><br>
What is the Minister talking about? Is he referring to peanuts? We wish to ensure that local authorities can get on with their programme of improving and building houses. He should realise that the provision is chicken feed. We want to put into the Bill something that will give local authorities an incentive to do something about accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can say that. He should listen carefully to what I am about to say, which will reinforce what I said earlier to the hon. Member for City of Durham. The truth is that Ministers in the Department of the Environment recognise that the present system of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
allowing capital receipts to be used 100 per cent. on capital repairs or 20 per cent. for new build, does not solve many of the problems of inner urban areas.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton is the first to advance the case that his constituency is still an urban area. I respect what he has said on that in the past and I have had the privilege of visiting his constituency with him. But many constituencies such as those of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) are not treated as fairly as they should be on local government capital finance and housing finance. The present regime, which allows housing receipts to be drawn down and spent in one way or another, favours those in the south-east. That will not please all my hon. Friends or, necessarily, all Opposition Members. The Members who should be a little more excited and enthused about the Bill are those who represent the more industrial constituencies in England and Wales.<br><br>
Several figures have been given. I appreciate that they are illustrative, but I have studied the effect of the amendments. Amendments Nos. 304 and 305 would give a debt redemption figure of 20 per cent. for all receipts, which would reduce the scope for credit approvals by some £2.5 billion. I hope that I do not have to go over the issue again as it was adequately and skilfully explained by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government in our debate on the previous clause.<br><br>
Even amendments Nos. 324 and 325, which would give 50 per cent. from council house sales and nil for other receipts, would reduce credit approvals by £1.9 billion. That would be unacceptable to local authorities and, if they were honest, to Opposition Members. I do not suggest that all who spoke were trying to mislead the Committee or being dishonest. I merely suggest that they do not understand the Bill's principles.<br><br>
Opposition Members certainly do not know about the new housing subsidy because we have not yet decided what it should be. I hope that they will await our announcement with eager anticipation. The commitments given in the White Paper and on Second Reading make it clear that they will benefit. The last person who should open his mouth is the hon. Member for Leeds, West. No authority has had more assistance from the Department of the Environment on estate action or housing action trust than has the city of Leeds.<br><br>
I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). He suggests that we should phase in the reserved part for receipts from council house sales, starting with 50 per cent. in 1990–91 and increasing to 75 per cent. by 1995–96. The 50 per cent. for 1990–91 would also apply to receipts from the existing system.<br><br>
The argument against amendment No. 324 also applies to my hon. Friend's amendment. A reserved part of 50 per cent. in 1990–91 would reduce credit approvals in that year by some £900 million. I am no sure whether local authorities would welcome such a package.<br><br>
Spending power from receipts will be particularly high in the first year of the new system, even without
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0825">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
my hon. Friend's amendment, and I am sure that I can convince him of that. The figure is estimated to be about £4 billion because of the large amount of receipts that local authorities will bring forward from the present system—1990–91 will be a particularly tight year.<br><br>
I regret that I cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment. A major benefit of the new system is that it will enable us to redress the balance between spending power from credit approvals and that from receipts. Under my hon. Friend's proposal the benefit would not be fully available until five years into the system, and I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 326 would delete subsections (3) to (5). The regulation-making power in subsections (3) and (4) is important. We have made it clear that we wish to provide exemptions from in-and-out transactions, which exist in the present system, and we need the regulation-making power to do so. We shall set a reserved part of zero per unit for the relevant receipts, equal in some ways that may be appropriate for capital receipts to convey no spending power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Minister has in mind a specific example of a change that he wishes to make. Why does he not table an amendment to that effect, rather than give himself power to do much more than he suggests?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is presumably referring to the Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The Minister has just said that there is a change for which he wishes to use the regulatory powers that my amendment would delete. Why can he not table an amendment to that effect, rather than give himself sweeping powers under subsections (3), (4) and (5)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall consider what the hon. Gentleman suggests provided that he does not press his amendment.<br><br>
8 pm<br><br>
Amendment No. 190 provides that where the direction-making power of subsection (5) is applied to a capital receipt generated under the present capital control system, the direction should be made before 1 April 1990. For example, it might be appropriate to make a direction to set the reserved part for any receipts remaining from a large-scale housing disposal that went ahead under the present capital control system. In such cases, the authority needs to know what the reserved part is before 1 April 1990 because that is when it has to be set aside. The amendment ensures that it does.<br><br>
Amendment No. 308, would provide that when an authority has repaid all its debt, it should not have to set aside any part of its receipts as provision for credit liabilities. It is important to be clear what sums set aside as provision for credit liabilities can be used for. As well as repaying borrowing they can be used to finance expenditure covered by credit approvals.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
Clause 54(1) explicitly provides that. It is only once an authority has repaid all its debt and has sufficient receipts set aside to meet its likely credit approvals in future years that there will be a problem of what might be called surplus receipts set aside.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I accept that we have to consider what might happen when an authority has no debt. A number of shire districts could be in that happy position if they sell all their housing stock. We are considering that matter carefully. Subsection (4) explicitly provides that we can set different reserved parts, including zero, for authorities with different credit ceilings. The credit ceiling broadly measures an authority's net capital indebtedness. Therefore, we could meet the purpose of the amendment by regulations under the clause. We have not ruled out further amendments which would provide alternative solutions. I hope in the light of that, and the assurance that we shall look at the issue seriously, the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.<br><br>
I shall not shy away from answering the questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) but I shall deal with amendment No. 327. That amendment is intended to provide relief for what is known as "improvement for sale". That is when an authority improves an asset before selling it. This is one of several areas where schems can benefit from relaxation of the prescribed proportion rules in the present system. We are considering which of these exemptions should be carried forward into the new system, and we shall certainly consider that one. I must point out, however, that any exemptions that we permit will increase spending power from receipts and hence—for any level of planned gross expenditure—will reduce credit approvals. I hope to be able to announce our decisions on these and other exemptions shortly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.<br><br>
I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and I recall his contribution on Second Reading. He will not be surprised that I disagree with his solution to many of the problems that he outlined. He referred to tight and efficient local authorities but his local authority, even under the present system—I appreciate that the situation may be an improvement on that in the City of Durham—had an underspend on its prescribed expenditure limits of £2.8 million or 33 per cent.<br><br>
We must be careful when we try to give the impression that local authorities are as efficient as we wish them to be. I do not intend to give my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton the impression that I am criticising Taunton, which I have never visited officially. I am told by officials that there was an underspend, even under the present system. It is beholden on my hon. Friend to come back to me when he has studied that point because we may be able to deal with it.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the Division Bell is for the House of Commons or the House of Lords but I want to quickly answer the point made by the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy)—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the Minister. We have not sorted out the question that I and the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that my hon.

I am sure that we shall have the opportunity to return to that matter and I shall be belabouring my hon. Friend the Minister with questions in the meantime</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister did not offer examples from my area that were quite so cutting, so his answer does not apply widely. I shall not give the civil servants a chance to come back on that.<br><br>

If the Minister cannot give me the answer to that question immediately, I shall be happy to receive it in a letter from him.<br><br>
Secondly, subsection (1)(a) could be interpreted as eliminating the possibility of barter or mixed consideration deals.

<br><blockquote><p>"(6)(a) The calculation of the minimum revenue provision referred to in Part IV of Schedule 3 to this Act will permit other proper practices to be used for the redemption of debt.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>A local authority shall determine its minimum revenue provision in accordance with proper practices and the duty to determine such provision shall be performed before the beginning of the financial year to which the provision is to relate.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment enables local authorities to calculate their own minimum revenue provisions. Clause 53 is a possible area of conflict. The amendment allows codes of practice to be on equal footings with statute. Local authorities have traditionally been free to manage their debt in the best way they can and a code of practice already exists between local authorities and the Treasury.<br><br>
The Government proposals to force councils to repay debt have no standing in the accountancy profession. There are other ways or repaying debt such as the sinking fund method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of straight disagreement. The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) would like local authorities to choose the system they use for redeeming debt. Some of them already use a sinking fund and, originally, we proposed a straight line arrangement which would have been much tougher. Many local authorities thought that wrong and so we arrived at our current proposal—the reducing balance method—in response to their requests. The hon. Gentleman's arguments for not having debt redemption are ones that he has used before. No doubt I shall not convince him, just as he will not convince me about his view.<br><br>
If there is to be a debt redemption arrangement, it must be based on a mechanism used by all, otherwise it will have a curious effect on different authorities. Our arrangement is a compromise. It seems much more widely welcome by local authorities than the original proposal. I hope that the Committee will agree to keep it, although I recognise that it is a matter of disagreement between both sides. No doubt, however long we were here, we should not persuade each other of our respective views. But it should be put on the record that our proposal is a response to the local authorities that wanted to change our original proposal.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 318, in page 126, line 21, at end insert—</span></p>
<p>"PART 1A</p>
<p>EFFECT OF UNDERSPEND IN 1989–90 ON CREDIT APPROVALS</p>
<p>1(1) If Part VIII of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 (in this Part of this Schedule referred to at 'the 1980 Act') applied to the prescribed expenditure of a local authority for the financial year 1989–90, it shall be determined whether—
<ol>
<li>the total of the payments made (or treated as made) in respect of that prescribed expenditure<br><br> falls short of</li>
<li>the aggregate of the amounts which, in relation to that authority, fall within paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (3) of section 72 of the 1980 Act for that financial year.</li></ol></p>
<p>(2) If for any local authority there is such a shortfall as is referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, it is in the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule referred to as the '1989–90 underspend' of the authority.</p>
<p>2. Where a local authority have a 1989–90 underspend, their basic credit approval for the financial year 1990–91 shall be taken to be increased by an amount equal to the underspend'.</p>
<p>3. Not later than 30th September 1990, each local authority to the prescribed expenditure on which Part VIII of the 1980 Act applied for the financial year 1989–90 shall determine the amount of their 1989–90 underspend (if any).</p>
<p>4. In this Part of this Schedule—
<ol>
<li>'prescribed expenditure' has the same meaning as in Part VIII of the 1980 Act; and</li>
<li>'the financial year 1989–90' means the financial year beginning on 1st April 1989 and 'the financial year 1990–91' means that beginning on 1st April 1990.".</li></ol></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that we shall disagree again, but a question of justice is involved. If local authorities are to be penalised for overspending, why should they not be rewarded for underspending? If an authority overspends its prescribed capital expenditure in 1989–90 under the old arrangements, its credit approvals in 1990–91 will be correspondingly reduced. The amendment would deal with the reverse situation. If an authority underspends its prescribed capital expenditure in 1989–90, the amendment would ensure that its credit approvals in 1990–91 were correspondingly increased. The Government should tackle that question of natural justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if the amendment were accepted, it would have little or no effect because local authorities rarely underspend their allocations. I asked my officials to check that precise point. They examined the figures for 1986–87—the last year for which there are full returns. Only one authority underspend in that year. Hon. Members may be surprised to learn that it was the London borough of Camden. Surprise, surprise, it underspent by nearly £2 million. I wonder whether it was unable to organise itself sufficiently to take advantage of the available resources.<br><br>
There is a clear difference of opinion between the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) and me.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
It is important to distinguish between two completely different factors. First, there is a tolerance. I remind the Committee that that word is used to mean flexibility to switch allocations between years. The present system has a 10 per cent. tolerance, so 10 per cent. of allocations can be switched between years. The second factor is a sanction against overspending. I mentioned that in reply to an earlier debate and need not repeat it. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
