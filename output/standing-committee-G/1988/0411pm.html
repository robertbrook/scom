	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember that, when we adjourned, I was in media res and explaining what will happen to housing associations that are companies or industrial and provident societies, which they almost all are. I use the word "almost" only lest I am proved incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The associations will be included under part V and, if they meet the test, will be subject to the regulations as controlled or influenced companies. That is right because they would be extensions of a local authority rather than independent bodies. They are covered in the Bill for practical and sensible reasons and not for dogmatic purposes. They are included not because of their name but because they fit the requirements of the Bill. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) that he is right to ask that associations are covered, and that they are brought within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who do not want housing associations or other bodies to be covered by the Bill must explain why a body that in material respects is controlled or considerably influenced by a local authority should be able to operate outwith capital controls. Those who argue that the capital controls should be evaded because the amount of capital spending allowed is not sufficient should urge us to allow further capital expenditure. They cannot suggest that we should give some authorities greater capital expenditure than
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
their needs suggest by allowing capital expenditure by a controlled or substantially influenced company instead of making it a direct and clear responsibility of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to consider the Bill clause by clause as, although an issue may be covered in later discussions, the argument may hinge on the earlier definition of the word "influenced". Housing associations might not have thought the issue through in the context of the composition of their management committees, they could find themselves in difficulties. Has the Minister consulted housing associations and made them aware of the tone of the clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Housing associations are unlikely to find our proposals a complete shock. They have been before the public for some time. Moreover, the housing associations to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) refers must have seen themselves as extensions of local authorities rather than as independent bodies. They should not need such consultation. I do not think that we will experience the problems that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific discussions with housing associations or other groups are not necessary because here we are treating them not as housing associations but as companies. We are applying to them the regulations that are being applied to all other companies. There has been little pressure from housing associations, or any other group, asking to be excluded, and I can think of no reason, other than the dogmatic, for excluding them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for returning to the point, but I take the view that housing associations should come within the ambit of the clause and, as my right hon. Friend the Minister said, it would be wrong to exclude them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that, because of the way the legislation is drafted, a local authority that enters a transaction with a housing association—it shows the significant influence that it has, from which it derives enormous benefit—is exempt. This morning, I gave the example of a local authority that is using a housing association to get round capital controls. It is selling land to a housing association, guaranteeing the mortgage and the running loss, giving 100 per cent. nomination rights, paying housing benefit, and ending up with what is in fact a local authority estate but without the right to buy. The local authority has used a housing association as an extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend is registering surprise that such a transaction is not caught. It is not caught, and my argument is that it should be. If the purpose is to bring many other bodies and companies within the framework of capital control, the proposed regime should catch such a blatant attempt to get round capital controls. I repeat my slight disappointment that the transaction is totally outwith control, and that by that ruse, the London borough is able to get round capital controls and the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton that if the transaction is guaranteed as he says, that meets the requirement of doing its business with the local authority. When the local authority guarantees the debt of a housing association, it fulfils that part of the twin requirements. I agree that we should have another look at the matter to see whether many local authorities not only guarantee but do not have at least 20 per cent. of the directors of a housing association, and whether they are sufficiently subject to local authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see how a local authority would be able to control such a housing association without the twin requirements. A housing association that was truly independent but had a guarantee of a loan would not be caught, but in most if not all of the circumstances that my hon. Friend describes, the local authority has further controls through its control of housing associations at least to the tune of 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to look into any cases that my hon. Friend has in mind, because if other elements combine to produce the same result, that should be caught, and if he thinks that there are any cases in which that happens, I shall be quite prepared to look into them and table an amendment that would catch them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press my right hon. Friend because much of the control comes within the housing responsibilities of the Department, rather than local government. The housing department has all the details of the transaction that I described, and has confirmed that the transaction is outwith capital control and does not score against the housing investment programme allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the guarantee would not score because although the local authority has guaranteed the transaction, it has not guaranteed not less than one half of the net assets of the company involved. The housing association is very large and it would not score under the Bill—certainly not under the 20 per cent. of voting rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend should liaise with the housing department to establish whether the legislation catches all the transactions that he hopes it will catch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that the housing department has given me the answer. I am satisfied that many of his anxieties would be met by the present regulations. If others are not, I undertake to try to do something about it. It is the purpose of the proposal that such circumstances should be caught by the legislation, not because we wish to restrict but because we wish to be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for the London borough of Ealing, for example, so to exceed the capital arrangements that are provided according to its needs that it reduces the capital allocations provided for other authorities according to their needs. The Labour party finds it difficult to understand that, however local authorities are organised, the Government must have a view on total capital
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
spending. If one authority, by misusing the system, is able to grab for itself more capital expenditure than its needs would otherwise allow, it can do so only at the cost of another local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's Front Bench spokesmen should face the fact that if a Labour Government continued, as previous Labour Administrations have done, with a total figure for local authority capital expenditure, they would have to share it out equitably. A Labour Government would have to ensure that one authority would not gain more than it would otherwise be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is amazing, especially in the light of the debate during the passage of what became the Housing Act 1988. At that time, the Government were casting housing associations out into the wide world and saying that they should survive by raising funds from the private market and become more independent of government, especially local government. Either it is a partnership or it is not. It is strange to hear the Minister and his hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) arguing that the housing association movement should again be brought within the ambit of central government. The Minister wants to have it both ways. If housing associations have the money, the Minister wants them back again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has it entirely wrong. I said that if the housing association movement is in the wide world, there does not have to be control, but if it is not, there must be control. That is the issue. The hon. Gentleman will not face the facts. If a local authority guarantees a housing association's debt so that, to all intents and purposes, it is the housing department of a local authority, it should be counted as such. If, in fact, it is an outside, independent body and finds its feet in the real world it is a different kind of authority and the hon. Gentleman must accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government accepted that when they discovered what damage was done when they did not accept it. That is what the former Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Anthony Crosland's expression, "the party is over" was about. It was no longer possible for local authorities to spend as they wanted to because that would have meant that others in the public sector would have been deprived of their fair share. Once again, the Conservatives are fighting for equity and fairness and provision according to need; the Labour party is fighting for any means whatever of getting round fairness and equity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the Minister, who is obviously not aware of what happens in other parts of his Department. The urban development corporations are providing facilities for housing associations. Millions of pounds for housing and other facilities are being pumped into those associations which could equally well be provided by local authorities, which would be more efficient and certainly more democratic. The Minister should be aware of what is happening in his Department. The money is there.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0855">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
We in the Labour party argue that it would be much better spent by local authorities than by quangos set up by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now advances a different argument. All the money paid in that direction is already counted in the total of capital spending. There is no question of avoiding that total. We are trying to deal with a local authority that establishes, or involves itself in, a company in which it has control to avoid capital controls and thereby to spend a capital allocation that is outside the total amount. That is a means of taking from one authority because of another's sleight of hand. That system is unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) intervenes, I should say that I am worried that we are going extremely wide of the amendments, which relate to percentage of voting rights. The debate is developing into one on housing associations, which we can have another time, but not on these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your comment, Mr. Hunt. I do not wish to stray from the amendment. However, I think that the Minister is wrong when he speaks of the total amount being included. If he analyses the London Docklands, he will note a vast difference between what was allocated and what was spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to do other than refer to the amendments and the percentages to which they refer. We want to ensure that the capital expenditure of all companies that are an extension, either through influence or control, of local government, counts towards the total, just as spending on an urban scheme is taken into account when the total for local government expenditure itself is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) would do much better to argue about the total of capital expenditure allowed to the public sector in general and to local government in particular than to argue that local authorities should be able to avoid it merely by setting up a company. That is the only issue, and the hon. Gentleman would be better engaged in dealing with it. I advise the Committee to support the 20 per cent. figure, which is more sensible. It has proper credentials and comparisons and would seem to catch those who should be caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton that if, on reflection, it seems that significant problems will not be caught, I shall try to find a better way to proceed if he is prepared to accept that his approach in a later amendment does not fully meet the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little unclear about exactly where we are because the hours have
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
intervened, but the question is not simply how much capital is available to local authorities generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree completely with the Minister when he says that the argument is about levels of capital expenditure. That is not the issue. The issue is about methods of control over capital expenditure by local authorities. We spent all last week disagreeing about those methods of control and debt redemption. That is why we feel so strongly about the clause. To stop local authorities which they think are evading the capital controls, the Government are spreading the net so widely that it will be to the detriment of many companies which benefit the people they serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 410, in page 63, line 28, leave out "one half and insert "three-quarters".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 413, in page 63, line 44, leave out "one half and insert "three-quarters".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are on the part of the Bill that deals with voluntary organisations. There is concern among the voluntary movement that more of them will be caught by the provisions in the Bill than is absolutely necessary. Hence the amendment to delete the words "one half" and insert "three-quarters". The amendment's impact will be to narrow the definition of the business relationship between a company and a local authority to exclude more voluntary organisations from the definition of local authority influenced companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our proceedings, my right hon. Friend showed genuine concern about the Bill's impact on the voluntary sector by moving a substantial way towards it when we dealt with the arrangements for London and the metropolitan counties. In the amendment, and in later amendments, the voluntary movement is looking for the same goodwill so that it is not hit by the bullets whizzing between Whitehall and town hall and injured as an innocent bystander.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business relationship defined in clause 58 includes cases where 50 per cent. or more of the company's income is from the local authority, the company is based in local authority owned premises and it is in the process of applying to the local authority for a grant. The voluntary sector is concerned that this definition could result in many voluntary organisations being classified as local authority influenced companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been suggested that many voluntary organisations are constituted as companies for wholly understandable reasons, not least of which is the desire to limit the liability of their members. Many voluntary organisations receive more than half their income from the local authority since the nature of the work requires some paid employees and involves planning costs. Many voluntary organisations cannot obtain funding to meet these costs from the private sector or through other general fund raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many voluntary organisations are located in premises owned by local authorities, which is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
encouraged by the Government so that local authorities make good use of assets that are already within the public sector. A number of voluntary organisations will fall into the categories caught by the Bill, as drafted, such as the citizens advice bureaux, information technology centres, many community enterprise projects, social welfare projects and councils for voluntary services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my right hon. Friend aware of the concern in the voluntary sector about the Bill's impact and the administrative complexity, which some of the proposals will undoubtedly create, in that a register will have to be kept by local authorities to determine which voluntary organisations in the area are companies in which the local authority has an interest? We have tabled later amendments to deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has a bureaucratic implication which cannot be ignored, and the amendments try to reduce the large number of voluntary organisations that will be caught up in an administrative system which I do not believe my right hon. Friend intended to apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a nutshell, the amendments narrow the definition of the business relationship between the company and the local authority to exclude voluntary organisations. I hope my right hon. Friend can smile on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton on these problems. We cannot accept the amendments simply because it must be clear from my hon. Friend's earlier remarks about housing associations that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a body calling itself a voluntary organisation under significant local council control might be used as a means of allocating to that local authority a larger proportion of capital spending than it would be entitled to by its needs, to avoid capital controls. That is the problem on the one side. On the other side, some local voluntary organisations are caught by the provisions in a way in which my hon. Friend finds unacceptable, as, indeed, do the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to reassure my hon. Friend by saying that we intend to find a satisfactory way of introducing an amendment that would exclude citizens advice bureaux. They play an almost quasi-statutory role as they are funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, and the way in which they operate makes the provisions in the Bill difficult to apply. There may be other organisations that could be dealt with similarly. If my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton or other members of the Committee can think of such examples, I shall consider them, without commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall exempt citizens advice bureaux from the effects of the clause as they have a constitution that enables us to ensure that they cannot be used as an extension of the local authority. The proud record of independence of citizens advice bureaux over the years ensures that that does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton will accept my undertaking on that specific
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
matter, and my willingness to consider other examples that he may wish to cite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All members of the Committee welcome an exemption for citizens advice bureaux.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want, however, to press the Minister further on other organisations that could apply for exemption. Will he clarify why such organisations could be exempt? Would that be because of their track record or because of their constitution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be done by the exemption powers under the Bill. I may have suggested that it could be done by amendment, but that need not be so. The Secretary of State could use his exemption powers for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot give wholesale exemption to voluntary organisations. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton will understand that, even though he may not agree. We cannot allow voluntary organisations to be used as a vehicle to avoid the impact of control over capital expenditure. The exemption would cover an organisation that was clearly not set up for that purpose. The Secretary of State will be open to propositions from organisations that believe that they are in the same position as CABs, but CABs have a particular role and are funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) keeps me on the straight and narrow on such matters, and I am sorry to use the inelegant expression "quasi-statutory role" that many CABs have when they provide services that would otherwise be provided directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of no other organisation that is in its position, and has identical difficulties, but I do not want to close the door on that possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an interesting point. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said that there would be others—I believe that there are—working in the community that are purely voluntary but are largely funded by local authorities. The councils for voluntary services in many areas are currently in that position—especially the one in Leeds, which is made up of a wide range of representatives and is totally independent of the local authority. One would need to study the details to know whether it would qualify under the national rule. Does the Minister consider the difficulties faced by that council as grounds for exemption under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I am happy to consider any case, but the hon. Member for Normanton must not start from the assumption that it is a mark of disapproval if an organisation comes within these regulations. That is not so. There will indeed be some that reasonably come within these arrangements, but for which that is in no way onerous. The only real effect of many of these regulations—as his hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen admits—is on capital spending and what counts towards capital expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many voluntary organisations that will in no sense be a major disadvantage. The problem with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
the CABs clearly derives from their national arrangements, structure and special role, which is recognised by the Department of Trade and Industry. For those organisations the clause would impose a need for reorganisation of a kind that is not sensible in the context of what it would achieve. I shall therefore ensure that they are exempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are others that are on all fours with the CABs I shall be happy to look at them. I do not think that there are, but I am genuinely happy to look at them and I hope that hon. Members will bring such cases to my attention. I sincerely wish to help in whatever way I can, without torpedoing the reasonable control to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton referred. That was why I was pleased that he put it after his own tough assertion of the need for capital controls generally. The two ideas do not necessarily march in opposite directions. As long as they can march together, I am happy to ensure that there is a proper band to whose tune they can march.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his generous response. I concede that his way forward is better than the one outlined in the amendments—namely, specific exemption as the case merits, rather than the slightly wider exemption that would be secured by the amendments. I am only sorry that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) was not in his place to hear what my right hon. Friend said, because the Newham Citizens Advice Bureau would benefit from the exemption that we have just heard about. I know that the moment that he comes into the Room he will want to thank the Minister for what he has just done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, my right hon. Friend may find that there are other bodies providing services similar to those of the CABs which may feel that they could make a forceful argument for themselves. I shall put it no more strongly than that. As my right hon. Friend knows, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. The Law Centres Federation is funded by the Lord Chancellor's Department and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations gets money from the Home Office. They all do admirable work on a local basis and provide a service not wholly dissimilar, in some cases, from that of NACAB. They are funded by the local authorities, although they have a central affiliation to a national body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations such as MIND or Age Concern have a roughly similar set-up of a national body and local branches. My right hon. Friend may find one or two people beating a path to his door, urging him to exercise generously the wholly commendable flexibility that we have heard about. I know that what he said will cause genuine relief in one part of the voluntary movement and will raise the hopes of other parts of the voluntary movement. It shows—as we have known all along—that he is genuinely concerned about voluntary organisations and will do what he can, within the framework of the Bill, to help them. In view of what we have just heard, I do not wish to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not over-anxious to discuss the technicalities, but I should be grateful if the Minister would deal with one point that troubles local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the new subsection (3)(c) would widen significantly the definition of "business relationship" and, therefore, the definition of an "influenced company". It appears that the aggregate of past financial assistance to a company in the form of grants, loans or advances, and all past guarantees, would have to be added to the local authority's existing stake in the company when applying the 50 per cent. rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that interpretation is correct, and all past financial assistance must be taken into account, it is unreasonable. The net effect of the amendment will be that a local authority will have no choice but to reduce its representation on the board of the company by reducing its voting rights to below 20 per cent., if it wishes to avoid the import of capital, borrowing and other part V restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more reasonable approach would be to take account only of the financial assistance and guarantees shown in the company's latest balance sheet or given by the local authority in the most recent financial year. If the Government intend that all past assistance should be included before applying the 50 per cent. rule, they should clarify whether past assistance would be valued at its current or historic value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment does not change the situation, except that the previous wording may have suggested that all the loans were to be added up, all the moneys given under separate headings were to be added up, and then other arrangements, such as grants, were to be added up, but the three were never added together, which is nonsense. The purpose of the amendment is to reword the provision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
so that when one refers to the local authority's interest in the company, one refers to the total. Clearly that is what the Bill intended but, unfortunately, the drafting did not achieve that end. That is why the amendment is a technical change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. It was originally intended that, on historic valuation, the total amount that had been put into a company would be brought into play. It would be difficult to justify any other system. A body may have been substantially funded by a local authority in the past, but may not have received any funds in the past year. It would then stand as an independent company, even though it may have been wholly dependent on the resources that had been provided by a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right—a local authority can avoid having that counted against its capital spending, by reducing its involvement in the company to a level at which it does not influence the use of that historic contribution. In that case, the company would be what the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) wanted. It would be a real company in the real world, competing with other real companies and subject to the same effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although, technically, that is not the result of the amendments, the hon. Gentleman has put his finger on the purpose of the original—and now the improved—wording. It is to ensure that one can properly assess whether a company is under sufficient capital obligation to the local authority for that to count towards the two scores that it would need before it came within the control of the regulations. He was also right to say that if a local authority were not prepared to have a pay back of some of that money, the alternative would be to reduce its representation to below 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be of value if the local authority associations could again meet the Minister's officials in the next few weeks for clarification of the interpretation that he made to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now move into the definitions of some terms, not least what being subject to the influence of a local authority means. It is strange, but there seems to be an assumption that being subject to the influence of a local authority can be applied retrospectively. Our amendment would remove the possibility of a company being an influenced company even before it entered any contractual relationship that involved a formal business arrangement with a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the clause provides that a company can be regarded as an influenced company even on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
basis of its intention to enter into a particular transaction with a local authority. That appears to us to be unworkable in practice and I ask the Minister to explain to the Committee at what point a company can be said to intend to enter into a particular transaction. For example, what will happen if a company intends to enter into a transaction with an authority that may have no such intention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may be regarded as insignificant, but it is important because negotiations can continue for a very long time and it would be grossly unjust if the capital controls proposed for influenced companies were imposed on a local authority during such a process while no business relationship had been established. I ask the Minister to explain what impact the clause would have in practice, how intentionality will work and whether it will occur at the point of getting or returning tendering documents or even earlier when informal discussions are entered into. At what point will a company be deemed to be influenced by a local authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier discussions about housing associations and voluntary organisations, the Minister referred to the "guarantees of a transaction". If he were to suggest that the guaranteeing of a transaction should be regarded as the point of intention rather than being applied retrospectively that would go some way to meeting the demands of our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the way in which the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) put his proposition. I shall try to explain how we visualise the clause working. Even though he may not be in favour of its general tenor he will find it reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the proposition is not retrospective but prospective. For example, if a local authority decided that it wanted to make a contract for the next 10 years for the supply of services in certain areas, that would mean that the company with which it had made the contract would come within the rules. No further contract or deal has to be made thereafter, so unless there were such an arrangement the contract could be made with a company in circumstances in which it was not an influenced company. That contract would clearly make it an influenced company and nothing could be done about it for 10 years. The capital effects of avoiding the controls would be strong and would have serious effects on the ability to share out the capital allocations according to need. People would be able to jump the priorities merely by employing that arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked when a company will be affected. It will be affected in the sense that the local authority will have to attach the condition to its arrangement, saying in advance that it will make an influenced company, which would have to be taken into account in the capital spending. That is all that would happen. It would happen in advance of the contract being entered into to ensure that a company could not be set up for the purpose of receiving such a contract, thus being able to say that, when the contract was made, it was not an influenced company and could avoid capital controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments refer to the phrase in clause 58(1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the influence of a local authority".</p></blockquote>
As it stands, the clause sets out the circumstances in which a company will be deemed to be subject to local authority influence. Our argument is that it is not tightly enough defined. The amendments seek to ensure that only senior officers of a local authority who were appointed to the company by the local authority would be deemed to be:
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons who are associated with the authority"</p></blockquote>
for the purpose of determining whether a company was influenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who are the persons associated with the local authority for that purpose? In the Bill, there are seven categories of people who can cause a company to be considered as being under the influence of a local authority. If their number amounts to 20 per cent. of the directors or the management committee of a company, or if they hold 20 per cent. or more of the voting rights of a company, either as members or directors, there could be real difficulties. There is no requirement for them to be appointed by the local authority or for the local authority to know that they are there as members or directors, only discovering later that they were deemed to be associated with the local authority. Clearly, that would be nonsensical. If the Minister is saying that that is acceptable, he is expecting that a local authority would have permanently to monitor the jobs and leisure activities of all the members, directors and management committee members of such a company as defined in the Bill. How else could the authority find out if it was represented on, or associated with, a Company? If not, the local authority would be unlikely to know whether a company was subject to its influence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not spell out the consequences of a company being discovered at a later date to have been subject to the influence of a local authority. Amendment No. 393 refers to the timescale. The history of a connection could go back two or three years and the company may have spent the capital. Could the capital then be recouped? What would be the exact position of the company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult in this part of the Bill to deal with one clause without referring to subsequent clauses, so I beg your indulgence, Mr. Hunt, and refer to clause 59(2), where the whole burden is placed on the local authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure, so far as practicable"</p></blockquote>
that the company complies. It is up to the local authority to sort out who is involved with the company and whether they have any influence. Is the Minister now saying that it is the duty of the local authority to screen the nominations of candidates for directorships or management committees? Does the local authority then have to notify the relevant company of the possible consequences of the election of a certain person? Is he asking the local authority to be the watchdog?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are trying to impose controls on companies which are genuinely influenced by local authorities, what they consider to be that genuine influence should be made plain in the Bill so that everyone can be clear what it means. That is what our amendments seek. We want to be sure, for example, that only persons appointed to the company by local authority are held to be in a position to exercise influence on its behalf. Otherwise relationships that may be tenuous, or occur by happenstance—where persons could be held to exercise influence on behalf of the local authority even when the local authority had no knowledge of their existence in such a capacity—could cause difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
The Minister may say that the categories set out in the Bill are clear, but there are question marks over each of them, from a member of the local authority through to a person holding office in a political association. Rather than go through the list, I shall give a couple of examples. The Bill makes no distinction between, for example, a borough treasurer and a part-time school secretary, yet their ability to influence is surely vastly different. No distinction is made, either, between a senior partner and a junior clerk. Surely that is unacceptable. It seems excessive to include any employee, regardless of grade or function. It even goes against the principles established in clause 2, when we debated influence and local authority representatives and members. Perhaps we should apply the same criteria here, otherwise there will be a discrepancy in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four years is too long; someone who left the employ of the local authority or lost his or her seat as a councillor could not be expected to exercise influence on behalf of the local authority some years later. Why could the Minister not apply the same conditions as exist in the Civil Service? The two timescales should be brought into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of spouses and business associates seems, in the circumstances, a rather harsh restriction, as is the exclusion of a person holding office in a political association. The restrictions are so wide that they would catch virtually everyone. I seem to recall seeing in the press this morning that an internal auditor of the London borough of Wandsworth was up to something with the Monday Club. He would not be eligible. As the categories outlined in the Bill are so wide, many organisations would be prevented from being represented. Individuals on those bodies may find themselves, by happenstance, caught by the clauses and deemed to be influenced by a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise the position of housing associations and I want the Minister to go into detail in his reply. We discussed capital spending but another issue arises because many housing associations will be deemed to be influenced by one or more local authorities. Many have received land from local authorities at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable. Until some years ago local authorities were required to dispose of land to housing associations at outstanding debt loan. If they wished to charge more, they had to seek consent from the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more than likely that a business relationship already exists. Many housing association management committees have appointed representatives of local housing authorities, local councillors and so on. The clause seems to be a random catch-all. I want the Minister to assure the Committee that that is unintended. Housing associations may find that the whole of their capital expenditure would first have to be approved in toto by the local authority and would then count against the local authority's capital allocation. Surely that is not the Minister's intention. But, unless the clause is amended, that will be its effect. It is not right to pretend that nothing would happen if the clause remained unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
The Minister said earlier that it is not a penalty to fall within the remit of the clause, but that may have serious consequences on housing associations. It is interesting to note that the provisions fly entirely in the face of the guidance that was produced under the Housing Act 1980 on a large-scale voluntary transfer of stock. Under that guidance, a local authority-sponsored housing association set up to receive a local authority's housing stock under section 132 of the Act is deemed to be independent of the local authority if 20 per cent. or less of its management committee or board of directors is appointed by the local authority. If there are direct local authority appointees, no random category of association is proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not believe that that could happen and may say that it is doctrinaire. But an example is the constitution of the new Chiltern Hundred housing association. It has taken over all the housing stock from Chiltern district council, which provides 20 per cent. local authority appointments on its management committees. It will automatically be brought within the provisions of clause 58. Its capital expenditure will automatically be counted against Chiltern district council's capital expenditure. I wonder whether the Minister and Chiltern district council realise that. I made that point to emphasise that this is a serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would come into operation only if the Chiltern Hundred housing association had bought the houses at less than the market price. If it had not so done, the business relationship that would bring into operation the other part would not exist. I have not heard otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot now state the value of the houses that were sold. However, if there were a definition that a business relationship exists only if the houses are sold at the market price, that would undermine the other seven categories. If any other person is seen to be stepping outside the bounds of influence and is a member of the management committee of that board, that comes automatically within the ambit of the clause, regardless of capital considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many bodies other than housing associations—for example, civic societies and regional sports councils—have local authority nominees on their management boards. They may find that even when their council nominees do not amount to 20 per cent. of the membership of their management committees they will have to ensure that none of the other members of the management committees or general committees fall within the categories defined in clause 58(4), as this would bring them within the 20 per cent. provision. The clause as drafted is too restrictive. It needs amending to tighten the definitions of what we might call an officer of the authority to include only those officers who could reasonably be assumed to be influential. The amendment draws those definitions tighter, relating them to clause 2. The definitions would include heads of authorities in paid service, statutory chief officers, non-statutory chief officers and deputy chief officers. In those terms there could be clear definitions of who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
constituted a local authority's influence on boards, in companies and on committees.

The other amendments propose the deletion of the other five categories of person suggested in clause 58. They should be clearly deemed to be associated with the local authority and not vaguely associated, as these catch-all clauses propose.

Inevitably, councillors become involved in the wards in the areas that they represent, as do their wives. There is a network of relationships built by local councillors in their areas. As a consequence of subsection (4), councillors' wives will have to be careful about the voluntary bodies on which they serve because they may find that, unwittingly, a body has become associated with a local authority and may become liable to the penalties provided for in the Bill.

Local authorities will have to ask members of management committees who currently employs them and where they were employed for the previous four years. They will be asked whether they were local authority councillors in that time and who they married. Subsection (4)(f) relates to spouses. I wonder why it has been confined to spouses. All social security legislation—and the community charge regulations—go further than spouses and include people who cohabit. I do not know whether this

restriction is to keep old-fashioned Victorian values. An authority will also have to ascertain whether a person was nominated by another person who currently is a local authority councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities will have to devise a fairly careful monitoring system to keep tabs on the current and ever-changing compositions of voluntary bodies that are companies and with which they have a financial relationship. There is a risk that local authorities may decide that the involvement is not worth the candle because the system is too complex and that they will stop funding voluntary organisations that are companies. All members of the Committee would regret such a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four amendments in my name are intended to minimise bureaucracy and to target requirements where they are necessary so that local authorities do not have to recruit more staff to operate this part of the Bill. My amendments would avoid voluntary organisations being unwittingly caught up in the controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend has a proposal on my amendments similar to the excellent concession that he produced two groups of amendments back no one would be happier than me, but I am sorry to see a shaking of heads at the Table. I hope that he will recognise this genuine anxiety and say that he has some answers to the problems that the hon. Member for Leeds, West and I have discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I may be the exception on the Conservative Benches. I, alas, have never served on a local authority although I made three attempts to be elected to the Socialist republic of Islington—all abortive, I regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I put the fears of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Clause 58(4) refers to persons
	<br><blockquote><p>"associated with a local authority".</p></blockquote>
The association argues that it is unreasonable that directors of a company that is controlled or influenced by a local authority should, solely by virtue of that connection, be treated as being associated with the local authority for the purpose of determining whether another company is influenced. In a locality it may be usual and desirable for a particular private-sector figure, for example, the director of a chamber of commerce or the manager of a major employer, to be a director of several private or public-sector partnerships. He or she loses independence to later appointments because of earlier ones. Can my right hon. Friend meet that fear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the earlier comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young). He said that we would be much happier if we did not have a history of these stratagems being used in some areas to try to avoid the reasonable controls that national Government must have on aggregate local government spending. I entirely agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) was extremely generous and just. I hope that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
compliment does not embarrass him, but he was most reasonable when he said that we were dealing, not with penalties, but with the question of whether particular circumstances should be counted within or without capital controls. He said that we should consider the questions with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying, not that people get themselves into a mess and should be punished, but that an organisation or company could be transferred from one category of company to another. The hon. Gentleman wanted us to tighten the arrangements. I suspect that his proposal would loosen them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to tighten them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what the hon. Gentleman means. He wishes to tighten the definitions so as not to catch so many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no way of dealing with this group, other than amendment by amendment. I wish there was an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 332 would limit the officers who are relevant to the test, to the chief executive, chief officers and their deputies. I sympathise with the proposition, but I do not understand how it would work in practice. In some of the companies none of those people would be the relevant officer. For example, it might be a divisional education officer or the superintendent of a particular establishment. We cannot avoid the problem by applying the legislation to only a small number of officers, which would go against the overall purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The usual practice in local government when a chief officer is nominated is that he has the power to nominate a nominee to represent him. That person speaks with the authority and power of the chief officer. That prevents a junior officer from acting without the authority of the chief officer. That, I think, is common practice in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but if a junior officer were elected by the local authority as a means of avoiding having an extra person counting against it—that is what would happen under the amendment—that would counteract the purpose of the measurement. I agree with the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but it is not relevant to what I was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 333 seeks to delete all that we have suggested, except for members and officers. It will be clear from a moment's reflection that consultants, for example, are often used in such circumstances, and in that sense they are as directly associated with the local authority as are the officers or members. It would be possible to have a clearly influenced local authority by having people on it who had consultancy arrangements with it. That would be disadvantageous. I point out to the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) that it would undermine the whole arrangement if someone who had a consultancy arrangement with a local authority were allowed to go on to such a committee but not count toward the 20 per cent.,
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
whereas an officer of the local authority would count. Such an anomaly would be unacceptable even, I think, to members of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy for amendment No. 334, but not perhaps for the reason that the hon. Gentleman gave. There is a danger with the present drafting of getting into a circular situation. May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton, who expressed the anxieties of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, and to the hon. Gentleman that if they agree to withdraw the amendment, I shall consider what they have said and try to find a way of meeting their concerns. They are circular concerns: if someone who is a member of an influenced company is put on to another company, that, too, becomes an influenced company, and because he is a member of that company he is a member of an influenced company again. It is a circular. That would be a mistake, and if my hon. Friend agrees, I shall look into the matter to see if I can meet the worries that exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 335 seeks to leave out anyone who works for a company who is a consultant for a local authority. That cannot be sensible, because it would put the person who works directly for the local authority at an obvious disadvantage. It would be difficult to exclude such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 336 would limit employed consultants to directors, managers, secretaries or similar officers of a consultancy company. It seems to ignore the way in which consultancy companies operate. Someone who is employed as a consultant may not hold a managerial appointment in his employing firm, although no doubt some do. That is not how many consultancy firms operate. Such firms have specialist consultants who technically may not be managerial but are senior management figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 393 would limit the period over which we look back to find former members, officers or employees of a local authority to two instead of four years. We have amended our proposals so that the question of a former link no longer applies to people who are employed as consultants. That meets one of the concerns of the chambers of commerce. Four years is appropriate because that is the usual local authority election cycle. It is a matter of judgment but it appeared reasonable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say why he did not take the restrictions on civil servants as the norm, rather than the election year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The election cycle seemed more appropriate. It can be justified on the basis that when elections have just taken place a person is far enough removed not to be a nominee. I can understand that there will be arguments about it because it is a matter of judgment. I do not wish to be over-emphatic. I believe that the link in the Bill is more appropriate, but the hon. Member for Leeds, West takes a different view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 337 would delete the categories of those linked to councillors by marriage or business
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
partnership. That category is in many ways a protection. I say to my hon. Friend for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) that we are not returning to Victorian values. His is a charming concern. I believe that society would be much happier if we returned to Victorian values on the matter of the indissolubility of marriage. I agree with my hon. Friend—we are not divorced on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules on councillors' pecuniary interests assume that the spouses and business partners of councillors should be treated on the same footing as councillors. Hon. Gentlemen have mentioned cases—in response to cases cited by Conservative Members—in which councillor A is working for a company which has made arrangement B. The fact that it is the company which has made that arrangement and not the councillor or his wife, both of whom may have an interest in the matter, has not been a bar to the Labour party pointing out such failings when they involve Conservative councillors or to the Conservative party when the failings involve Labour councillors. That is reasonable and it would be odd to exclude the rules on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 338 would delete the category of those who hold office in a political party associated with members of the council. But in the real world, one of the ways in which companies are set up is by ensuring that the people involved, although they do not actually sit on the council, arrange the party affiliations of those who do sit on the council. They are closely associated in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about amendment No. 340 which seems to be blatant discrimination in favour of the Conservative party. I wonder if Labour Members on the Committee have noticed what it would do. It would mean that the Labour party would not be allowed to sit on the committees without it counting towards the 20 per cent., but that the Conservative Association, which is the phrase that we, in our old-fashioned and gentlemanly way, use, could sit on the committees. I could not countenance that because my reputation would be at stake. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant) would be quick to point out that that would be real discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 417 is, as would be expected from my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton, a more radical measure than the Opposition amendments. It would leave out the category of consultants rather than limit it to some consultants. Some of my hon. Friend's remarks suggest to me that I should look again at the way in which the clause is drafted. If he will allow me to do so, I hope to be able to meet some of his concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked about voluntary organisations and I am aware of the concern for them that lies behind this and other amendments. I remind him that my earlier agreement applies to those organisations. Any voluntary body that was made exempt by the exemption procedures would not fall within this category. A major review of this part of the Bill has arisen because of that concession. That review follows those who suggest that voluntary organisations might join the citizens advice bureaux in this category. It is not a wide category, but it is important because of its relation to the CABs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
As for voluntary bodies, the situation arises only when the local council decides to carry out a specific transaction. It does not have to poke its nose into what all voluntary bodies in the area are doing. First, the council would deal only with those that are companies. Then it would deal with them only if it entered into a transaction with them. Moreover, it need worry only if the association with the voluntary organisation which happened also to be a company made that organisation a major doer of business for the local authority. That restricts the category even further, so only a relatively small number will be involved. Those that are not exempt are companies which have a major proportion of their business with local authorities, and with which local authorities have entered into or will enter into a transaction. It is a fairly small category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a local authority has some doubt about the 20 per cent. figure. In many cases, there will be no doubt because the local authority will have appointed the people. There may be some doubt in a very small number of cases, but I cannot believe that it will cause anything like the difficulty envisaged by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton. If it causes difficulty in individual cases, there are ways to deal with that. The local voluntary body might consider the membership of its management committee and the directors of the company. The easiest and simplest way might be to consider how it is set up. It might consider that its structure should be changed or it might be a body that is subject to the exemption, as all CABs will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems that worry my hon. Friend are not as real as he fears. One valuable aspect of the Bill is that the Secretary of State can use the exemption power, which the Opposition wished to remove. If my hon. Friend's fears prove to be real, it would be possible to do something in extremis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must oppose amendment No. 418, just as I did an earlier amendment about past links. The amendment would negative the purpose of the provision. The same applies to amendment No. 419. Amendment No. 420 would achieve the same as amendment No. 338 and should be resisted on the same ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that it has taken me some time to respond to all 14 amendments in this way, but they raise different issues. Before I give way to the hon. Member for Leeds, West I remind the Committee that we are dealing not with a penalty but with what organisations more properly ought to be considered within the local authority rather than in an independent ambit. Our proposals, which are fair and reasonable, provide a measurement of that. We believe that they will affect fewer people than is sometimes suggested. They bear companies only on companies that meet two different tests. The proposals do not bear on those companies which the Secretary of State exempts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be clear about the limitations that are inherent in the clause rather than fear that the provision will extend too widely. But within those limitations it is important that capital spending by local authorities should be properly assessed and not subject to what the hon. Member for Leeds, West
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
referred to as happenstance. I am concerned to discover—I am sure that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) will help me—the precise English distinction between chance and happenstance. I suspect that happenstance bears the same relationship to change as transportation does to transport. They are American attempts to make the simple and ordinary more complicated and extraordinary. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The American nation has managed to resurrect a number of words, such as "gotten". We have lost that one although we have kept "begotten", if I may return to Victorian values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to come back with the expression "outwith", but I may delay the Committee if we discuss language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a central confusion in what the Minister said. I have the impression that he feels that local authorities will get people to filter on to voluntary and independent bodies from the back. The difficulty will arise with people who are not appointed by the local authority. That is the crucial issue. For example, what will happen to the ordinary voting members of an organisation under clause 56(4)(a) who are in no way nominated by a local authority but could be included under the 20 per cent. criterion if we stick to the criteria set out in the seven categories? Is that not the real difficulty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that a difficulty is conceivable in some circumstances. Often one can construct circumstances in which there is a difficulty, but I suspect that such a difficulty is imaginary rather than real. In most circumstances difficulties will not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Company structures are such that these matters are perfectly clear. I cannot easily envisage circumstances where this provision will create a real difficulty. If such a hypothetical position arose, the remedies would be relatively simple. Arrangements could be made to dilute the percentage and 20 per cent. would not be a problem. In many cases a company will not mind being associated with a local authority because the capital issue will not arise. All these considerations would have to be taken into account. For it to mean anything, a company must have an association with a local authority. The addition of its capital expenditure to the local authority's is important for capital borrowing. That is not the case for many companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not persuaded by the hon. Member for Leeds, West to modify the clause as he suggests. However, I shall look at the point on amendment No. 334 to which I referred and certainly look again at the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton on amendment No. 417.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with those assurances, and my previous assurances about CABs and the power that the Secretary of State has to exempt, the Committee will reject the amendments and accept the clause as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is creating the impression in his lengthy reply that he is offering further concessions following previous concessions to earlier
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
amendments. When he resorts to saying that difficulties are conceivable but imaginary, he is asking us to have faith in his judgment. In the past, I remember distinctly being told that our impression of the effects of reductions in housing benefit were imaginary, not real, yet later that led to transitional payments. I recall being told that alterations to the board and lodgings allowance were imaginary rather than real. Recently, we commented on the increase in costs for eye tests, glasses and dental inspections, and Conservative Members have discovered that those so-called imaginary increases are real.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.00 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that my arguments are imaginary, but our amendments show that there are circumstances in which the clause could lead to difficulties. The Minister did not move beyond that point, but suggested that the time brackets were arbitrary. We must be absolutely clear about what it means to be subject to the influence of a local authority. That should be tightly defined. The criteria in the clause catch all. The local authority may be unable to be Big Brother, but it must be little brother to check up on the details of those who will make up the organisations to which the clause refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's lengthy efforts to create the impression that he was prepared to offer substantial concessions, that is not the case, so I urge the Committee to vote for the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I have not achieved my aim which was not only to give the impression of concessions but to offer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton that in clause 58(4)(c) we are considering those who are employed by local authority-controlled companies. We understand what the Association of British Chambers of Commerce is saying and we shall be glad to see whether the definition can be tightened to bring out that distinction. I do not wish to promise too much because perhaps that cannot be done without opening the door to a range of other matters. However, if there is a way of meeting a genuine anxiety, we shall try to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment, so I shall be brief. Parts IV and V seem to bring the sort of companies that we have discussed under fairly strict fiduciary and proprietary control. For example, private sector investment will count against the local authority's controlled total, which implies a strict financial relationship between that sort of investment and what happens in practice. It also makes such companies subject to possible investigation by the ombudsman, which gives any disgruntled ratepayer the opportunity to ask for an investigation into what has taken place. Company borrowing would also be subject to approval by the full council. So it appears that there are extensive controls over these matters in those parts of the Bill as it stands. What is being proposed seems unnecessary, and I am anxious to find out what the Minister has to say about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 59(5) allows the Secretary of State to require a local authority or a company to obtain consent to a particular course of action. A number of questions arise from that, which I would like on the record. What criteria will the Secretary of State use when deciding to exercise that power? How will he decide whether he himself or the Audit Commission must determine an application, and what criteria will be used in considering such an application? Does the Secretary of State envisage using that power frequently, or are local authorities expected to take on trust that such power would be used only in exceptional circumstances? How long would the process take? I am genuinely seeking information before we consider whether to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise, in a sense, to return the compliment paid to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George
	<span class='label label-info column'>810</span>
Young) when he stood in for me the other day. I am now standing in for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aspect of amendment No. 422 that I wish to highlight is the much-discussed question of local authority-influenced companies. I support the case made by the Government today for imposing controls on local authority-controlled companies, for the reasons that have been set out. However, I am anxious about whether identical controls on local authority-influenced companies have been justified. That applies also to the whole range of voluntary organisations that can be classified as influenced in that way. I shall give an example shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend had originally tabled amendments Nos. 421 and 422. In your infinite wisdom, Mr. Hunt—which is accepted and respected on all sides—you have chosen not to select amendment No. 421. That causes me slight difficulty, which I shall try to explain by speaking only about amendment No. 422. That amendment proposes that the controls should be limited to local authority-controlled companies, while amendment No. 421 would have built in the safeguard that if a local authority went astray, there would be a ready means whereby the Secretary of State could tackle the matter by requiring the relevant influenced company to provide him with an annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Minister responds, she will no doubt make it clear whether she accepts that that would cover the Government's back, without a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing for a wide range of voluntary bodies. If the Secretary of State believed that the organisation was being used by the local authority as a means of avoiding controls, he would have powers under clause 59(3) to prescribe requirements to be complied with by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one example, not from my borough, but from Greenwich. The Greenwich volunteer bureau has a total funding of £80,000, of which £60,000 comes from Greenwich. The management committee of 14 includes one councillor and two officers from social services, and there is one vacant social service officer place. The project has no way of knowing whether other members are associated, but it is believed that at least one other person may work in an arrangement with a councillor. That project is not substantially different from others that I could name, which fall just outside. The matter has been amply covered in earlier discussion, so I shall not prolong the point. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has taken it on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already discussed the definitions of local authority companies. Clause 59 lays down powers for the Secretary of State by order to set standards regulating, forbidding and requiring actions in the case of each type of company. The local authorities are under a duty to ensure that, as far as practicable, they comply with those standards. The standards do not directly influence the companies; subsections (2) and (3) require local authorities to meet the standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) argues through amendment No. 394 that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
we should delete the provision that would enable the order under clause 59(1) to require the consent of the Secretary of State or, subject to Government amendment No. 506, of the Audit Commission to an action by a company subject to the control or influence of a local authority. Amendment No. 422 would remove that power only in respect of companies subject to the influence of a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the more general amendment moved by the Opposition, there are two crucial points. First, the provision that the hon. Gentleman wants to omit does little more than simplify the procedure for giving the approval of the Secretary of State to a course of action. There may be cases where it will not prove possible to produce a sufficiently water-tight definition of the distinction between what is acceptable and what is not. In such cases it may be best to proceed by means of individual approval of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be nothing to stop such approval being given in individual cases by orders under clause 59(1). However, to require a separate order in each case would introduce a bureaucratic procedure, inappropriate to the degree of scrutiny required. There would also be delays—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because this is a complicated clause I wanted to explain its framework. It is proposed that the power should only be used for two cases. Where a local authority controlled company wants to trade with the public beyond the powers of the controlling authority, we want to be able to give consent for that on a case-by-case basis. An example might be of a local controlled company which considered going into the private sector and wanted to be able to trade more freely prior to that. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State would be able to give his consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example would be that when a controlled company appoints an auditor, the Audit Commission's consent to the appointment should have been given. This is an important provision because, at present, local authority controlled companies are free to choose whoever they wish as an auditor, so to safeguard the interests of local people and electors by requiring the appointment to be approved by the Audit Commission seems to be a sensible and reasonable step to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. Will she give me an assurance that the power would not be used, for example, to allow a local authority to vary its economic development plan in relation to an influenced company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no proposals to use the power in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex clause but the Opposition should not be unduly worried about the way in which subsection (5) would be used. It is a way of creating greater flexibility because in the regulations governing local authority controlled companies there may be times when the general rule may be rather stricter than a specific case might require. Therefore, subsection (5) allows greater discretion to the Secretary of State and there are no grounds for thinking that it would be used in a restrictive fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend expect discretion to be exercised by the Secretary of State under subsection (5) in favour of charity shops run by registered voluntary organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that we do not believe that charity shops will be local authority controlled companies, so they would not be appropriate under subsection (5). I am sure that my hon. Friend is aware that the welfare and wellbeing of voluntary organisations are close to the Government's heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of the clause, we will, by order, prepare regulations to control the standards in local authority companies and local authority influenced companies in general. We hope to bring forward those regulations shortly and will consult local authorities about them before we make an order. No doubt, in consultation on the draft regulations, consideration will be given to any unforeseen implications for voluntary organisations. All of those consulted will be able to make representations and not least of them will be my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke to amendment No. 422, but we have made no proposal for the use of that power in relation to companies subject to local authority influence. However, we have to complete our consultation with local authorities about the precise definition of controls proposed for companies subject to local authority influence. If we can define in general terms all the controls that we wish to apply, the power to reserve matters for the Secretary of State for case-by-case approval will be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch that we would prefer, particularly with companies influenced by local authorities, to make general guidelines and lay down general regulations so that the power will not be necessary. However, we believe that sufficient flexibility has been provided. I do not wish to rule out the possibility that, although we have not proposed it in our consultation paper, others may persuade us that there is a case for the approval of the Audit Commission of the appointment of auditors by local authority-influenced companies. I hope that I have satisfied my hon. Friend that although our aims are similar to his, we do not want to rule out flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the proposal in an amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch did not move is that it does not take account of our proposals. The power under subsection (1) will not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0867">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>813</span>
bite directly on any company, but will only establish the ground rules which the local authority will be bound to apply under subsections (2) and (4). My hon. Friend's approach is based on a misapprehension about subsection (1). It is in the regulations that we hope to set down the way in which we believe that the local authority—influenced and controlled companies should behave. The duty will be placed on the local authority to ensure that in so far as it has discretion it will uphold and implement the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that any voluntary associations will, after allowing for exemptions, be controlled companies. We have no proposals to limit the powers of influenced companies to trade with the public. That answers the question of charity shops. The restrictions on trading with the public will apply only to controlled companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and the hon. Member for Knowsley, North will, I hope, be satisfied that the amendments are not justified in terms of their effect on local authority companies and also that subsection (5) seeks to promote greater flexibility in the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 60 covers the control of minority interests in certain companies. Except with the approval of the Secretary of State, a local authority may not have an interest in a company to which subsection (2) applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation document and the response to it, the Government made it clear that they envisage local authorities having a minority interest in some companies. Page 11 of the orange consultation document lists some companies in which it will be proper for a local authority to invest and have a minority interest. The response to the consultation document made it clear that there will be others—for example, mutual companies, combined heat and power schemes, and waste disposal companies. Although there is a blanket prohibition in the Bill, the Government have made it clear that there will be exemptions. However, the uncertainty is worrying the voluntary organisations. To some extent the purpose of the amendments is to enable the Government to make it clearer whether they will exempt voluntary organisations that have formed themselves into companies, which would be one solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will permit local authorities to have minority interests and some areas have been identified in which that will be allowed—for example, the promotion of commerce, art, science, education, religion, charity or any profession. I understand also that housing associations and enterprise agencies are likely to be included. But unless there is some clarification, many voluntary organisations will not form themselves into companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were listening to the debate and considering setting up a voluntary organisation, I should avoid making it into a company and stay outside the provisions of this part of the Bill. There is some uncertainty for voluntary organisations and local authorities because they are not clear whether they will be able to give grants to voluntary organisations that are companies when they may not be able to be represented on their management committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way around that is to adopt some of the amendments, which would exempt voluntary organisations. We are discussing minority interests and the stakes are lower than in earlier parts of the Bill when we discussed companies under influence or control. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will go a little further than she has done so far in explaining how this part of the Bill will operate. I hope that my hon. Friend will explain whether it is possible to exempt voluntary organisations entirely from this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a word or two in support of what has just been said. Citizens advice bureaux in England and Wales receive funding under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, and the Minister for Local Government, who is no longer with us, gave a commitment concerning the bureaux. I hope that that commitment will extend to the issues that arise in the amendments. I draw the attention of the Minister who will reply to this part of the debate to the earlier undertaking because I wish to probe to establish whether what was said earlier about citizens advice bureaux will apply in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Members of Parliament have good cause to be grateful for the help that the citizens advice bureaux frequently provide, often with encyclopaedic knowledge of social security regulations, and their willingness sometimes to spend an extraordinary amount of time and effort to solve some of the problems that present themselves in our constituency advice centres. The role of the bureaux has already been referred to and I do not need to persuade the Committee of their value throughout the country, but it is legitimate to test the sincerity of earlier comments concerning the review of the CAB, to the extent of inviting the Minister to say whether it will extend as far as the issues raised by the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government propose to permit minority interests only in cases where they can be shown to be a advantageous, according to page 17 of the consultative paper. Clause 60 does not define the types of permitted interest. Instead, it sets out the activities which a local authority may not undertake without prior consent of the Secretary of State. Local authorities appear concerned that the types of permitted interest are set out in consultative papers rather than in the Bill. There is further concern that, given that the Government acknowledged that an authority could be unaware of influencing a company, a reason should be given for restricting the type of company initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restrictions in clause 62 attack the right of the voluntary or private sectors to choose who may be involved in a company. For example, housing associations' management committees frequently choose to appoint one or more representatives—officers or members—of the local authority who are able to bring a wider perspective and expertise than may otherwise be available to the committee. That is because the housing associations value a close working relationship with the relevant authorities rather than the relevant authorities trying to influence the activities of the housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an apparent conflict of interest between clause 60 and part III. Part III specifically permits a local authority to invest in commercial industrial or public undertakings and acquire share or loan capital in such companies. Is clause 62 intended to take away that right? If not, why cannot an appropriate provision be put in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar conflicts arise with recreation. I am intrigued to learn that Middlesbrough council has an
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
interest in its local football league club. That shows that the local authority believes in life after death, from what I remember of the last time I saw Middlesbrough play. The initiative comes largely from the club. A number of clubs, which are limited liability companies, have become involved with local authorities, which have acted significantly to save some of the clubs by injecting money into them. It is right that it is in the interests of the ratepayers of Middlesbrough council that the council has a shareholding in, and representation on the board of, the club in return for financial investment. That is reasonable and no doubt the Minister shares that feeling. Perhaps he will act to ensure that clause 60 does not prevent that. When in another life I suggested that the greater London council should step in to save Chelsea—in my earlier years, as chair of the general purposes committee—we had serious talks about the appointment of councillors as directors of the club. I like to think that that would still be possible under this part of the Bill. I was hoping to be that nominee from the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has given an undertaking that the Government have no intention of trying to catch the NACAB under this part of the Bill. The same consideration applies here, although my right hon. Friend was referring to the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young). In this instance, however, I shall disagree slightly with my hon. Friend which will distress me considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The litmus test of whether voluntary bodies should be within or without the legislation—the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) uses the phrase often, and rightly so—is whether there is a loophole
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
through which a voluntary organisation could escape this part of the Bill. I shall give my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton a brief example. The difference between us is the fact that my hon. Friend's amendments would provide a more flexible attitude towards voluntary organisations and would give a number of local authorities the opportunity to drive a coach and horses through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton correctly referred to the consultation paper which, I am sorry to admit, contained a mistake that he may have noticed when he read it to prepare his speech. The paper referred to two categories which are directly relevant to our debate. The first mistake was less than immediately obvious because of a typing error. It carried the short description of "a professional association" and that should have been called "a professional association etc".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The omission of "etc" should have misled nobody because the body of the description went on to say that this category would cover a company limited by guarantee concerned solely with the promotion of commerce, art, science, education, religion, charity or any profession that is permitted to omit "limited" from its name. The last phrase is a short-hand way of referring to section 30 of the Companies Act 1985 which, in effect, requires a company not to distribute its income or assets to the members of the company. In our view, the provision will cover the vast range of worthy associations to which local authorities need to belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposed category of authorised company was described as a non-profit-making company—by which we equally meant one that was forbidden to distribute income or assets to members—which provided a facility for the use of, or for the benefit of, residents of the local authority's area, and to which the authority had given financial assistance under a power other than section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may well ask why we proposed the additional requirement that assistance should have been given under a provision other than section 137. We took the view that local authorities should become involved in the management of a company—by participating in the company general meeting or by appointing to the board of directors—only where there was good reason for them to do so or where provision could not be made available in the private sector. We do not consider that there should be a simple ability to join in wherever a grant has been given. However, we shall discuss the proposed limitation further with local authority associations and will listen carefully to what they say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and the Government turns on the difference between his proposed definition, which would cover any body that is not a public body and whose activities are not carried out for profit, and the categories that I have outlined. So far, we have been unable to come up with any examples of what we would regard as worthy cases that fall into that gap. However, we have been able to find a number of cases where it would be possible for an authority to use a wider description to join in setting
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
up companies which would come as close as possible to the limits of the definition of local-authority-influenced companies, and which could be used for a variety of activities which we do not regard as appropriate for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, we do not think that it is appropriate for a local authority to play a role in a company that is set up basically to trade with the public in competition with other parts of the private sector. It is clear that a company could be set up—there are examples of this; indeed, it seems to be a growing trend—where a district authority—I give no names; let us say that it is in the west midlands—has set up a window manufacturing company. It would be easy for that local authority to set up what it could consider to be a voluntary organisation and thereby escape the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton has said on at least two occasions today, it is a pity that we have to go to extreme lengths to legislate for local authorities when only a small minority of them is hell-bent on breaking the rules. I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware of it, but the trend to which I have referred is a growing one in the north-west, and Ministers in the Department of the Environment regard such a company as a proper company, a proper voluntary organisation, even though some people have skilfully got round the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton seeks to achieve is absolutely right. He and I and my Front-Bench colleagues are at one on the subject of voluntary organisations, but unfortunately, in this instance, I believe that his amendments are wrong. I have dealt with the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Newham, North-West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that I have already undertaken to talk to the local authority associations on all these matters, and I am sure that we can reach a satisfactory arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens when a local authority purchases minority equity stakes in a company, with the prior agreement of the company's owners or managers? That can happen, for example, to help a company in the commercial sector. It would seem right for the local authority to be able to appoint people to the board to look after the minority share interest that the local authority has purchased. To what extent does the Bill rule that out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be permitted, and would fall foul of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. I should be more sympathetic to the argument that the amendments leave loopholes if the gaping loophole to which I keep referring in Ealing had been closed by some other part of the Bill. It is a loophole whereby £80 million worth of expenditure guaranteed by a local authority is entirely outside all capital controls. If that loophole were closed, I should be more sympathetic to the resisting of amendments that block smaller ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to detain the Committee, but the clause is an important part of the Bill. Proposals in part V are directed primarily at companies conducted for profit or established to circumvent Government controls on local authorities. However, they also affect voluntary organisations constituted as companies and trusts in which local authorities have an interest. Many voluntary organisations are constituted as companies with limited guarantees. For example, many community enterprise, social welfare and council for voluntary services projects are companies. The Department of Trade and Industry encourages citizens advice bureaux to become companies to limit
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
the liability of their management committees against potential claims by clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have said that citizens advice bureaux are worthy of special consideration and have been given some dispensation in the Bill. Other organisations also have an important role and should be given consideration. The Widdicombe committee recommended that the case for companies should be considered in the context of the detailed appraisal of the requirements of the services in question. The simplest course of action would be to exempt all voluntary organisations from the proposed controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local mining museum to which I referred earlier, should be given favourable consideration by Ministers. The management committee of the company—the trustees—is composed of two members of Kirklees local authority, four members of Wakefield local authority, two members from British Coal and two co-opted members. It can readily be seen that the organisation will not try to get round the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask that certain considerations be given to the Yorkshire mining museum and the other organisations that I have mentioned. Will the Minister consider exempting these bodies? The simplest course would be to exempt all voluntary organisations from the proposed controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already made it clear why it would not be right to exempt all voluntary organisations but we are prepared carefully to consider the implications for them, not only in terms of exemption but in the working of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may have been some misunderstanding by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). Many of the organisations that he regards as trusts might be local authority controlled companies. A trust is a particular form of organisation with no separate personality. It is invested in the trustees, whereas the company is an incorporated body. The mining museum which the hon. Gentleman mentioned is a local authority controlled company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals specifically with non-charitable trusts in which local authorities have interests. It gives the Secretary of State the power to amend the provisions in clause 58 relating to influenced companies and to apply them, as amended, to such non-charitable trusts. That is necessary because local authorities can use non-charitable trusts in much the same way as incorporated companies. A failure to extend the provisions in this way would create a loophole in the proposed arrangements. Indeed, an amendment which you have chosen not to call, Mr. Hunt, shows how a non-charitable trust might be used. We wish to be fair and to introduce controls and measures that will ensure the right standards of accountability and propriety in companies in which local authorities have influence or control. It is right and proper to have available a provision for non-charitable trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case, however, for making special provisions and adapting some of the procedures that are applicable to other incorporated companies. The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
an order by statutory instrument to do that. It provides the necessary flexibility to bring non-charitable trusts within the statutory framework, without unnecessarily imposing additional controls. I recommend that clause 61 stands part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 342, in page 67, line 12, after "(1)" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (4) below"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 343, in page 67, line 30, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) for the purposes of subsection (1) above—
	<ol>
	<li>a company shall not be treated as under the control of two or more local authorities unless more than 50 per cent. of the directors of the company are appointed by the local authorities;</li>
	<li>a company shall not be treated as subject to the influence of two or more local authorities unless the relationships set out in section 58(1) above exist between the company and each of the local authorities."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
No. 423, in page 67, line 15, after "two", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"but not more than four".</p></blockquote>
No. 424, in page 67, line 20, leave out "two or more" and insert "between two and four".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 343 seeks to ensure that no company can
	<br><blockquote><p>"be treated as under the control of two or more local authorities unless more than 50 per cent. of the directors of the company are appointed by the local authorities"</p></blockquote>
and that no company can
	<br><blockquote><p>"be treated as subject to the influence of two or more local authorities"</p></blockquote>
unless both a business and a personal relationship under clause 58(1)
	<br><blockquote><p>"exists between the company and each of the local authorities."</p></blockquote>
Clause 62 provides that a company that would not otherwise be controlled by, or subject to the influence of, a local authority can,
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the actions, powers and interests of two or more local authorities were treated as … one authority",</p></blockquote>
be considered to be controlled by, or subject to the influence of, two or more local authorities. This catch-all clause fails to take account of the differences in the wording in clause 57 on controlled companies and in clause 58 on influenced companies. It fails also to take account of the importance in clause 58 of both business and personal relationships with the local authority before a company can be treated as being subject to the influence of that authority. The results are bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 57 provides that for a company to be controlled by a local authority, the local authority must have power to control a majority of the votes
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
at a general meeting or to control the composition of the board. However, clause 58 does not require the local authority to have any hand in that or power over those persons who are considered to be associated with it. Also, the persons deemed to be associated with a local authority are wide ranging and may well have little or no connection with the authority. Therefore, it is feasible for a company which is not, even under clause 58, subject to the influence of local authorities to find that under clause 62 it is controlled by more than two local authorities. There are other examples which I could offer, but it cannot be the Government's intention in drafting the legislation for that to be the effect unless both business and personal relationships exist with the two or more local authorities deemed to be influencing the company. The proposed subsection (4)(b) will amend the Bill to ensure that no local authority can be deemed to be influencing a company unless both sets of relationships exist between the company and local authorities.

Will the Minister think carefully about these constructive amendments, which will help to provide better proposals in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. Clause 62, as drafted, contains two problems. The first problem concerns organisations such as the National Housing and Town Planning Council which, because of its constitution, scores as local authority controlled although the local authority only provides 7 per cent. of its income. If that body spent any money on capital, for example, by mortgaging its premises, all of that money would have to score against the capital of the local authorities which are in membership. That is nonsense and I do not believe that impact was the Government's serious intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem is the one facing organisations that are funded under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 when the moneys come from more than one local authority. Those organisations may find that when they spend on capital—this is because they get moneys from more than one local authority—those local authorities will have to score the capital expenditure against their allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that that is an unintended consequence. Unlike earlier clauses, this one does not have "except where the Secretary of State so directs" at the beginning. Accordingly, I am not sure how we shall exempt the nonsenses that I have described, unless we amend the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young). We shall have to examine what he said very carefully. I jumped to the wrong conclusion—namely that my hon. Friend was assuming that if a number of local authorities joined together it was not a case of whether a voluntary organisation funded by the joint authorities would suffer. More to the point, and this is a similar reply to the one that I gave my hon. Friend a few minutes ago about another amendment, there could be considerable abuse if a number of local authorities—I am sure I shall carry my hon. Friend with me on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
this—particularly London authorities, joined together to escape the provisions in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific point about the National Housing and Town Planning Council, we believe that an exemption for that company would be justified. However, we need to consider the matter in detail, and I give my hon. Friend an undertaking that we shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respond to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) about subsection (4)(a) and deeming a company to be controlled only where
	<br><blockquote><p>"more than 50 per cent. of the directors of the company are appointed by the local authorities".</p></blockquote>
That is already the case. A company will be deemed to be controlled where more than half of the company's directors are local authority appointees or where the local authority controls more than half the votes at a general meeting of the company. The amendment would therefore have the effect of unnecessarily stressing the former qualification and of entirely disregarding the latter. Assuming that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the former is already the case, obviously we would welcome his support.

I understand, Mr. Hunt, that there is a shortage of time and I hope that my answers to the amendment will convince Opposition Members to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
