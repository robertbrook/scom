<p>No. 834, in page 144, line 38, at end insert—</p>
<p><i>'Minor and consequential amendment</i></p>
<p>In subsection (1) of section 6 of the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act 1956 (ascertainment of annual and rateable values) for the words "the next following section" there shall be substituted the words "sections 7 to 7B".'.—[<i>Mr. Gummer.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McAllion <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 764, in page 144, line 39, leave out paragraph 1.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment—I do not want to be accused of being less than charitable towards universities in Scotland—to find out what the Government intend to do about the implications in paragraph 1 of schedule 6.<br><br>
Clause 118 brings into effect schedule 6, which includes the extension of charitable relief to universities in Scotland. I welcome the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1106</span>
showing a new charitable attitude towards universities in Scotland, particularly after years of squeezing spending which has meant staff cuts and departmental closures, and has even threatened the existence of some universities. I welcome the emergence of the Government's new glasnost approach towards universities in Scotland.<br><br>
There is more to paragraph 1 than first meets the eye. It alters section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions etc.) (Scotland) Act 1962 by removing the exclusion of Scottish universities from the right to claim mandatory charitable relief on non-domestic rates. That means that they will stop paying a large part of the rates which they now pay to local councils in Scotland. Mandatory relief is now levelled at the rate of 50 per cent., and that percentage will be saved when the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
On 1 April 1990 mandatory relief becomes 80 per cent., which means that universities will save up to 80 per cent. of their current rates bills. Perhaps they may qualify for the same maximum amount of relief as people who receive income support. That may also be a comment on the way in which Scottish universities have been reduced to the poverty line by the Government.<br><br>
Unless the resultant loss of rate income is compensated for completely by an increase in revenue support grant, all universities' rates bills will be reduced, presumably to ease their funding problems, but the cost to all community charge payers will be increased accordingly. That is the problem. The only source of revenue of local government in Scotland is revenue support grant from the Government, which comes from non-domestic rates and poll tax payers.<br><br>
The problem is that revenue support grant in Scotland has already been reached for 1988–89 and 1989–90. Unless that revenue support settlement is amended to take account of paragraph 1 in schedule 6 it is likely that poll tax payers will have to pick up the entire burden of rates relief for Scottish universities. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention, because a signifificant sum of money is involved.<br><br>
There are eight major universities in Scotland, one of which is in Dundee, and I shall give one example based on current rateable values. The amount of relief which will be claimed in 1991 by the Heriot-Watt university in Edinburgh will be more than £6 million. That is a large sum to put on the backs of poll tax payers in Scotland. Something must be done about that. The Government could give a commitment to attempt to alter the revenue support grant settlements for local government in Scotland to take into account the increased burden on local councils, or they could table an amendment that relief, if it is to be granted, will not be effective until 1 April 1990. As the Bill stands, universities can claim relief back-dated to 1 April 1988—at least that is the information that I have been given by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities which is concerned about the position.<br><br>
While I am not suggesting that the Government should force Scottish universities to pay the whole of their rates bills, they should take into account the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1107</span>
impact that paragraph 1 of schedule 6 will have on local authorities and their only source of revenue—the poll tax payers. The Government cannot, on the one hand, be happy to extend charitable relief to Scottish universities and, on the other hand, be determined that the people who will pay for that are the poll tax payers and no one else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to start the Committee today in anything less than the most happy mood, but the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) does not do the Scottish cause much good.<br><br>
The Government are not only bringing Scottish universities properly into line with universities in the rest of the United Kingdom by extending rate relief to them, but they are ensuring that the whole cost will be carried on the needs grant. That will come into force in 1990 and there is no question of the cost being borne by the community charge payers in Scotland. Instead of the hon. Gentleman saying how pleased he is and how sure he is that proper protection will be given and, on this occasion, congratulating the Government, he voiced all sorts of worries that do not exist, never have and never will.<br><br>
I am prepared to be attacked by Opposition Members on matters where there is a real difference of opinion, but on this the Government are attempting to help Scottish universities and to ensure that Scottish community charge payers, who are in receipt of considerable amounts of Government grant from charge payers elsewhere in the United Kingdom, do not suffer. Theefore, there is no need for the hon. Gentleman to be worried.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to comment on income support, I suggest that one of the remarkable facts of the British university system is that the Government spend more on students than almost any other Government in the world. Therefore, it will be hard to be rude about the Government on that subject.<br><br>
I am sad because I hoped that this measure would be a good beginning to an extremely interesting day, but the day has been marred by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. If the hon. Gentleman is able to be with us more often than he has been in the past—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Gentleman has a problem because he does not like discussing English legislation any more than he likes English hon. Members of Parliament discussing Scottish legislation. There is a slight dichotomy here. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will stay with us more often to see that in this Committee there are certain issues on which we share a common view, and this is one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McAllion</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I am glad to know that there are no implications for poll tax payers in Scotland. I noticed that the Minister, like Scottish Ministers, refuses to call the tax by its own name. It is the only tax that dares not speak its own name and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1108</span>
calls itself the community charge. We have value added tax and corporation tax, but not poll tax.<br><br>
The information that the Minister gave has reassured me and I welcome it, but it has not yet filtered through to Scottish local authorities. I am surprised that in preparing the Bill the Minister did not contact the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and tell it that there would be no problems about the revenue support grant settlement or poll tax. Had he done so, COSLA would not have needed to contact Scottish members of the Committee on the matter. I am pleased to hear that COSLA has nothing to worry about and that the Government will ensure that the revenue support grant settlement is altered to take account of the change. I welcome that news.<br><br>
I take this opportunity to tell the Minister that I may not be able to attend too many more sittings of the Committee, because I am a member of another Committee that is sitting at the same time. It sometimes sits for 26½ hours at a time. Does the Minister do that in this Committee?<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to an important part of the Bill in which the Government propose to introduce and regulate charges for local authority services, many of which up to now have been free or have been able to be priced by the local authority. It is interesting that the clause is entitled "Power to allow charges". It is another instance of the Secretary of State's creative abuse of the English language, in that there is not just a power to allow, but a strong direction.<br><br>
In this group of amendments we seek to clarify the Government's intentions. Amendment No. 765 addresses the important issue of whether or not a local authority will be given any choice. We hope that we shall have a clear answer from the Minister on that. Amendments Nos. 766 and 770 address the argument of the ability to pay. Amendment No. 767 is concerned with the effect on the poorest members of society. Amendment No. 768 examines the effect on local authority finances, and Amendment No. 769
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1110</span>
questions what I have previously described as the Napoleonic and Messianic powers that the Secretary of State takes to himself—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, both—to give himself the general ability to do whatever he thinks fit.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Government may argue that it is just a permissive power, but I see it as more than just permissive. The two subsections that matter are subsections (2) and (5). At best, they are ambiguous, and in all probability they will be legally interpreted as giving the Secretary of State a power to impose a decision on a local authority.<br><br>
That is not just my reading of the clause. We have been in touch with a number of people, and the general view is that it is at least ambiguous and may well be interpreted by a court of law as a legal power that devolves to the Secretary of State, if he or she so wishes to use it. We want the matter to be entirely clear. We do not want a repetition of what has happened frequently with this Secretary of State—cases in court to find out what legislation is really saying. There have been many occasions in the past when this particular Secretary of State has passed legislation or taken actions which have been found in court to be unlawful, and as a result, the law has had to be changed, or the Secretary of State has had to back down. That is the trap that we fear the Government are falling into because, at best, the provision is ambiguous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spoil the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I do not think that there is much between us. If there is any doubt about the wording, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it is not meant to do any of the things that he seems to think. Rather, it is intended to do the opposite: to make sure that there are some restraints on the discretionary power. I am happy to have another look at the wording to avoid the trap that he talks about. He has no need to worry. I am prepared to have another look at the wording if it is in any way difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want an assurance that is clearer than that. I want an assurance that the Secretary of State will not intervene, either to impose a charge or to regulate a charge that is made by a local authority. Is that what the right hon. Gentleman is saying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of the Secretary of State taking powers to impose a charge on a local authority; nor has he any intention of increasing the charge in some way. There is certain regulation, but it is meant to work in the opposite direction: to make sure that people are not overcharged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remain a little worried, because it is important to have the correct interpretation. The Minister says that the intention is not to increase charges, but perhaps to decrease them. That is what the Minister is implying. It seems to me that that interpretation means that the Secretary of State can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1111</span>
regulate charges, either up or down. I know all about this Government's intentions, and I know how good the Government are at dressing them up and concealing them.<br><br>
I want to be entirely clear about the matter, because it is crucial. The Minister is saying first, that the Secretary of State will not have any power, under the Bill as it is now worded, to impose a charge where a charge does not at present exist and, secondly, that there is no intention to regulate charges so that they are increased. I shall be obliged if the Minister will confirm the first point. On the second point, is he saying that it is not the intention, but that the law will allow the Secretary of State to regulate up or down?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am going to be devious, I promise to tell the hon. Gentleman in advance. There is no question of my being devious. I am trying to make the issue clear.<br><br>
First, the wording clearly troubles the hon. Gentleman. I have undertaken to look at it again to see whether there is any truth in his fear that it gives, or may be interpreted by a court as giving, the Secretary of State a power that he does not want. If necessary, I am happy to introduce an amendment.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked what the clause means and, if it does not have the meaning that we intend, what it will mean when we have amended it. I try to confine argument in Committee to issues where there is a difference between us, and there is no difference here.<br><br>
It will be for a local authority to decide whether it wishes to extend charging in a particular area. It is a discretionary power, if the Secretary of State permits it. Secondly, the Secretary of State takes to himself discretionary power to limit the degree to which that charging may take place. The sort of limit is expressed in the Bill. It is not a power in order to increase charging. That would be the opposite of the intention of the discretion.<br><br>
We are seeking to give a limited discretion to local authorities. It is limited in the sense of having to be given precisely to local authorities by the Secretary of State. It is limited also in that in some circumstances the Secretary of State may wish to say, "You can charge, but you mustn't charge more than the cost of providing the service."<br><br>
There is no question of undisclosed ferrets in this particular pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a long and helpful intervention, and I am grateful for it. There is still the matter of the hidden agenda, but I shall come to that in a moment as the clause has more aspects than that to which I am referring. The Minister's intervention goes some way to meeting our anxieties. May I put on record my understanding of the Minister's explanation to make sure that I have it correctly?<br><br>
The Minister will look at the wording again. If there is any doubt that the clause could give a Secretary of State the power to impose charges or to regulate them upwards against the wishes of a local authority, the Minister will redraft the clause to ensure that that cannot happen.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is nodding enthusiastically, which is good news. He is making a reasonable start to the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also determine from the Minister that the Government have no intention of putting into regulations maximum and minimum charges for certain local authority functions? For example, my local authority charges for meals-on-wheels. It could be catastrophic if its charge fell outside the maximum or minimum limit. I shall be happy so long as there is no maximum or minimum charge involved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's fear but, on my understanding, the Minister would go back on his explanation if he imposed a higher maximum charge than the local authority wished to levy. I think that that is a fair interpretation of what the Minister said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the hon. Member for Hammersmith meant to say was a fair interpretation of what I said. It would be perfectly reasonable for the Secretary of State to impose a maximum above which a local authority could not charge, even though the authority was charging less. The Secretary of State could reasonably say, "Whatever your charge is, this is the maximum charge."<br><br>
There is no question of imposing a minimum charge. This is a discretionary activity. There is no intention of compulsion inthe clause. I am sorry if the hon. Member for Hammersmith feels that he has been misled, but I am certain that I have now put him right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That explanation is helpful and I understand it. The Minister is saying that a local authority need not increase its charge to the maximum if it does not wish to do so, and that it can maintain its charge at the present level. That was my understanding of the Minister's long explanation, although my wording may not have been precise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the debate and, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) says, the Minister's replies have been interesting. The legislation specifically gives power to set a minimum charge. If, as the Minister says, there is no possibility or intention of a minimum charge, why is such a provision written into the Bill? Perhaps the Minister could delete it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to intervene to answer the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) he may do so at my invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall refrain from making any comment about Lib-Lab pacts, which would be most unfair. If, on further examination of the clause, we find that we have to meet the hon. Gentleman's fear, I am happy to delete the reference to a minimum charge as it is not our intention to set one.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have a clear understanding. The Minister will re-examine the clause. It is always difficult for the Opposition to seek appropriate legal advice on the interpretation of clauses, but that is what I wish to do. We are told by a number of sources that the wording is ambiguous, but I do not claim to be a legal expert.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the Minister's assurance, local authorities will for the first time be able to charge for services that people previously assumed were free. I remind the Government what they said in the Green Paper on the introduction of the poll tax. Cmnd. 9714 published in January 1986 said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government therefore proposes to introduce a new flat-rate charge—a community charge—for local services, payable at the same rate by all the adult residents of a local authority. Such a charge would be more perceptible than rates. Each local authority would determine the level of its own community charge. All adult residents would be liable to pay, not just householders."</p></blockquote>
We now come to the important point. The document continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"If each local authority is to be accountable to those who have to pay for its expenditure, clear and comprehensible price signals must be given to all local taxpayers. A community charge will achieve this, for all local adult residents will face similar bills."</p></blockquote>
The next paragraph states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Moving from rates to a flat-rate community charge would mark a major change in the direction of local government finance back to the notion of <i>charging</i> for local authority services. Chapter 7 outlines the Government's approach to increasing income from charges for those services where it is possible to levy specific charges, and where people have a genuine choice of whether to use the service or not. But although there is scope for extending user charging, most local authority spending will inevitably not be financed by such charges."</p></blockquote>
The Green Paper gives two aspects of the Government's thinking. First, charges should not be the main way of paying for everything. Secondly, the purpose of the poll tax is to enable people to be clear about how much they pay for services. The Government attempted to sell the poll tax to the country by saying that it was a wonderful innovation. If it is so important and effective, why do we also need pricing?<br><br>
Pricing will confuse residents about whether a service is included in their poll tax or whether they pay for it separately. Some of their services will inevitably be subsidised by the poll tax. For example, the education service is provided primarily by the poll tax, but people will pay a separate charge for a facility that is provided by the education service, but not in schools. At best, the provision is a confusion of the Government's original intentions on the use of the poll tax.<br><br>
Why do the Government want additional fees, not just on the odd occasions? They are giving local authorities a wide range of options for imposing fees. To go further into that question and to consider the Government's hidden agenda—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Irvine Patnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. This Government have plenty of hidden agendas. They did not tell us about water privatisation at the last election or about the health service, the homeless or income support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what the Government would have said about the Health Service. Would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1114</span>
they have told us that 10 years ago we were spending £8,000 million on it and this year we are spending £26,000 million—a 50 per cent. increase in real terms? The Government should say that more often, which is why I am saying it now.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order to pursue what the right hon. Gentleman said, but the Government want to cash limit the general practitioner service. They spend far less than any comparable Western country on health services. The Minister cannot get away with his corny old argument.<br><br>
The poll tax is composed of three parts: 50 per cent. is revenue support grant, 25 per cent. national non-domestic rate and 25 per cent. local poll tax. Rate support grant and the national non-domestic rate do not vary with a local authority's expenditure. Every pound that a local authority spends above what the Government think that it should spend will come from the poll tax. If £1 is cut, it will come off the poll tax. If it is raised by charging fees, the poll tax can be kept down. The Government are severely embarrassed about the level of poll tax and its impact. They want local authorities to impose fees so that they can keep down the poll tax. That is how the Government will try to defuse people's anger. They are told that the Government have improved services or cut taxes when in fact taxes have been increased and services made worse. Extra expenditure is diffused through other taxation systems or increased charges for services.<br><br>
The Government know that by allowing local authorities to charge fees, they can persuade local authorities of all political complexions to keep down poll tax. Previously, those services were free and, to a large extent, they must be provided anyway. Because of the structure of the poll tax, a small percentage increase in fees can lead to a large percentage reduction in the poll tax. A 10 per cent. increase in fees may mean a 40 per cent. reduction in poll tax.<br><br>
Local authorities will have to decide whether to charge for services that people cannot afford but need, or to keep the highly regressive poll tax high. A millionaire living alone in a mansion will pay only half what an elderly couple in a one-bedroomed flat will pay.<br><br>
Every £1 that the Government deduct from the grant-related expenditure means £1 more on poll tax. The Government will allow for income raised by fees and charges, and the local authority will be reined in yet again. What is the point of local government if it is constrained in that way? Why do Government not say that they no longer want local authorities to do anything significant?<br><br>
The Government are keen that there should not be a charge for refuse collection and other cleaning services carried out by local authorities. Why, then, are they not included in the list of exemptions? Why does the Bill not exempt refuse collection from charges? We are suspicious about the Government's intentions.<br><br>
Even the exemptions are not clear. Clause 123 relates to education in schools. Charges could be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1034">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1115</span>
regulated or imposed, for example, for youth work, school meals, adult education, careers services and even nursery classes. They are not exempted by the definition in clause 123. The Minister must make clear what is exempt. Charges may also be imposed on sport and leisure facilities. I suspect that that will be a major problem.<br><br>
What will be done about local authorities that give concessions to those less able to pay, such as old-age pensioners, the unemployed and people on income support? Many local authorities charge less to unemployed people who want to play tennis in the park. Will local authorities keep those concessionary charges or will they have to be dropped because of poll-tax restrictions?<br><br>
Clause 123 will affect fire services. They are exempt only for putting out fires, and saving life or property. It is not clear in either clause 121 or 123 whether people trapped in a lift, for example, will later be sent a bill for being rescued. Their lives are unlikely to be at risk—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a stupid thing to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The hon. Gentleman leaps in where wiser people fear to tread. It may surprise him that there are several ways of getting people out of lifts. One way is to call engineers. Some local authorities have contracts with engineers for that purpose. If they do not arrive quickly enough, the fire service may be called. Does the hon. Gentleman still want to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes wonder where the hon. Gentleman obtains his information. There is nothing in current legislation to stop a fire authority charging for getting someone out of a lift and some do charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is sad that the hon. Gentleman did not listen to my earlier argument. I am relating what I say to the Government's attempt to increase charges generally because of the poll tax.<br><br>
[<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman did not listen to the answer, there is no point his jumping up and down and going bright red like an agitated tomato. It does not work and if the hon. Gentleman will listen to me he will understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a good point. I can understand the tortuous argument about how the community charge works, but how can it be relevant to the discussion to suggest that the Bill will affect those services for which it is already possible to charge? Is the hon. Gentleman trying to raise a few hairs and frighten people in lifts? We must keep to realities and not go off on a mystic trip. Local authorities have had such powers for a long time, but, sensibly, they do not use them often. It is nothing to do with the Secretary of State or the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It makes me wonder if the Minister listens to anyone. I cannot be the only hon. Member who has had a letter from fire authorities expressing anxiety about that very point. The Minister may not have received the letter and may not be aware of its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1116</span>
existence. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) certainly is not aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We get many letters but they may not always be right. The only way that we could bring in charging for emergency services under the clause would be to restrict the existing discretion. The matter does not arise, so the hon. Gentleman should not frighten people. We have a responsibility not to pick up any old argument and throw it around because it might upset people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it were any old argument, there might be something to say for it. If it is the argument of higher authorities, the Minister is treading on dangerous ground. More important, he does not understand the parliamentary process. When considering a Bill, we examine the details of clauses because we are not interested at only one level of the Minister's intentions, although I have much interest in them. I am concerned about how the wording of clauses will be interpreted when the Bill becomes law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must wait a minute. If he did not rush, he might be able to help the Committee again. He began the morning by being most helpful and I should like to keep him on that track.<br><br>
The wording is clear. We are talking of a local authority's ability to impose or regulate charges. The Minister said that they will not be increased by the Secretary of State, and I accept that. We consider clause 121 in relation to the clauses which follow. The definition in clause 123 mentions only risk to life or property, or fire. If the Minister wishes to allay the fears that he accepts exist, but considers unrealistic, I put it to him that the proper parliamentary way to do so is to make sure that the definition is explicit in the Bill to enable it to be interpreted by a court of law, if necessary.<br><br>
There may or may not be a case for imposing a charge on releasing people from a lift. I do not think that there is. Is the Minister saying that there is, and that the fire service ought to be able to impose a charge more often? I realise that the power could already be present, depending on how one interprets the provision, and that the Minister wishes the power to be there. Is he saying that the fire service will be able to bill people for releasing them from a lift? If not, how does he explain his answer in relation to the wording in the Bill, as opposed to his intentions—which may be good, bad or indifferent?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only person to have raised the issue of lifts is the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I have objected to the hon. Gentleman's method of discussion because he raises unnecessary fears.<br><br>
The new powers cannot override the prohibitions in the Local Government Act 1974. Therefore the provision has been expressed in a parliamentary way. If the hon. Gentleman had bothered to examine the Act, he would have seen that it prevents fire authorities from imposing charges, save as expressly provided for in the Act. One charge that is expressly provided for in the 1974 Act, which was passed by a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1117</span>
Labour Government, is that relating to people in a lift. We are not changing provisions that a Labour Government enacted in 1947. The party that is committed to charging for people caught in lifts is the Labour party. If the hon. Gentleman had done his homework and come to the Committee properly informed, he would not have needed to raise these worries. This is a matter that could easily frighten people. The only way in which we could effect charging would be by restricting existing discretion, most of which was given to local authorities by a Labour Government in 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I knew that the Minister would again be saved by a good Labour Government Act of Parliament. The Minister began by saying that the only person who had raised the question was me. That is incorrect. I had not even thought of the idea. It came from the fire authorities. I am puzzled and worried that the Minister does not appear to have had correspondence, discussion or consultation with bodies which have these worries.<br><br>
What would happen to people who have a house or flat pumped out if there is a flood? Elsewhere in the Bill the Government have provided powers for themselves to give local authorities money for emergencies. Even in these circumstances, a fire service would be allowed to charge for such services. I suspect that it would be allowed to charge if someone asked for a report on a fire.<br><br>
In the old Greater London council, if there was a request for a report on the cause of a fire the council would provide it free of charge.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The people who complained to the hon. Gentleman have not been kind enough to write to, or contact, me. If they had, I would have explained to them what I will explain to him now: no changes are to be made to the present circumstances covering what fire services are allowed to charge for. Anyone who tries to stir things up in this way does so only for some other purpose. The provision is in its present form precisely because the Government did not wish there to be changes. We have kept within the structure of the present laws, which, were, in large measure, the work of a Labour Government. I am happy to stick with the 1974 Act; it may be a very good Act. I am not saying that every Act passed by that particularly bad Government was bad. I say only that before the hon. Gentleman pushed forward in Committee proposals that no one appears to have bothered to put to a Minister beforehand so that he could allay fears, he should have checked the provisions in the 1974 Act. Surely that is the proper parliamentary technique, not frightening people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not have been more appropriate and sensible for the Government to have consulted the fire authorities initially? That they did not says much about the way in which they operate. Fire authorities operate primarily under Home Office and Department of the Environment legislation but, apparently, the Minister did not ask their views; if he did, either he did not allow them time to decide what their anxieties were, or they eventually decided that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1118</span>
he would not listen to them anyway, which is why they wrote to other Members of Paliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is digging himself even deeper into this pit. We had a meeting 18 months ago, so they should have had sufficient time to think about their views. The fire authorities did not raise the issue because they knew that there was none. The only people who have done so, in Committee at least, are those who are trying to frighten people. Politicians have a duty not to do that unnecessarily. The hon. Gentleman has dug himself into a hole and is now thrashing about trying to find a way out. When someone has fallen into a heffalump trap, he should accept the fact and stop trying to be a heffalump</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is getting agitated because he knows that he is on weak ground. The reality is that his Government have been scaring and bullying people since they were elected. One has only to think of the so-called tenants' choice—otherwise known as pick-a-landlord or pick-a-tenant—to know that.<br><br>
There is much more to the argument. The Minister cannot escape the fact that the fire authorities raised these issues because, rightly, they are worried about them. It is no good his trying to hide behind the fact that he drafted the Bill in a way that has provoked those anxieties—<br><br>
[<i>Laughter.</i>] I did not draft it, nor did you, Mr. Hunt. You are entirely innocent. We know who did. All that we want to hear is whether the Minister will plead guilty or very guilty. Perhaps the Secretary of State is the very guilty one and he is merely the guilty one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, I wish that the Minister had written the Bill, so that his interpretation of it, and what he has said about it, which is recorded in <i>Hansard,</i> might stick. I fear that he did not write it but that someone in Marsham Street did. Our difficulty is knowing whether he understands his own Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am considering clause 122 in conjunction with clause 121 because my understanding is that it overrides other legislation.<br><br>
Libraries will be discussed shortly, so I will not pursue that topic now. All other areas can be included for charges, including social services. Perhaps there will even be a charge for registering for housing or for a social service. There may be a charge for clearing away extra rubbish, for all we know, because that has not been excluded.<br><br>
When Conservative Members say, "Oh, we shall not do that", we remember all the things that the Government said they would not do, and did. That is what places the Government constantly under suspicion. Indeed, other aspects of services will end up by being charged for.<br><br>
I shall now speak to amendment No. 769. We should examine the power that the Secretary of State gives himself in subsection (2). It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations may include such provision as the Secretary of State sees fit as regards charges for which the regulations provide".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1036">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1119</span>
Some Opposition Members are not convinced that the Secretary of State is fit for the job. Indeed, I suspect that, at times, the Prime Minister worries about that when she sees how water privatisation has been handled.<br><br>
We made a good start to this part of the Bill by obtaining a reassurance from the Minister, but he became increasingly agitated and worried when we talked about charging. Apart from the first issue I raised, the Minister has not said whether the fears expressed by people inside and outside the Committee are justified. The Government should legislate clearly, unambiguously and in a way that does not cause fear. It will not do for the Government to say that such fear is unnecessary because if that is the case that should be shown on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A novel view of legislation has just been presented. When a perfectly clear proposal is put forward and people outside—very often from clear, party motives—start using peoples' anxieties, totally without foundation, should we rewrite the legislation and say, "Although it is perfectly obvious that this need not be a worry, we would just like to say to you that it means what it says it means"?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) has to admit that he has got himself into a mess. That is what has really happened. The hon. Gentleman has gone out on a limb to support a proposition which does not stand up when it is looked at carefully. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman did that even after I made the perfectly reasonable statement that if any of his general worries about the clause were seen to be true, I would change the wording to meet that concern. I thought that I made that very clear.<br><br>
I find the arguments difficult because we had a lot of discussion about local authorities' independence and powers, and the hon. Member for Hammersmith made many statements about the importance of the Secretary of State giving more powers to local authorities. I would have expected a series of amendments to be tabled to take away the Secretary of State's right to decide whether charges could be levied and for it to be replaced by a general power enabling local authorities to charge when they think it suitable. That is the kind of freedom I would have expected Opposition Members to present.<br><br>
The second possibility would have been for Opposition Members to have tabled amendments to give local authorities a choice about how to modulate charges.<br><br>
Neither of those options were put forward. Instead, a series of fears, which were clearly knocked down in my intervention, have been expressed. A general rant followed, in which we were told how disappointed the hon. Member for Hammersmith is that the Secretary of State is the person that he is when most of us are particularly pleased that the Secretary of State is who he is and have considerable confidence—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not interrupt the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Secretary of State
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1120</span>
and I shall not let him interrupt mine. I shall have a little private encomium here and get some of my hon. Friends to agree with me and then we shall pass on, which will be a pretty fair balance. I am happy for this regulation to be in the hands of the present Secretary of State.<br><br>
Perfectly reasonable arguments could be given by different local authorities about how to extend, or not to extend, charging. The hon. Member for Hammersmith is least convincing when he flies off into enormous hyperbole and suggests a 10 per cent. increase in charges and a 40 per cent. decrease in the community charge. I have the benefit of a calculator to work his suggestion out, and it cannot be true. The hon. Gentleman will have to produce a scenario that is far from a political, or any other, possibility to substantiate it. The trouble is that the hon. Gentleman has undermined the case he put forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith does not like the wording in the clause but, if there is any reality in what he says, we have agreed to put it right. The hon. Gentleman produced examples that will clearly not arise from this clause or any other. The hon. Gentleman talked about a 10 per cent. increase and a 40 per cent. decrease. He made a personal attack on the Secretary of State and generally thrashed about comments on the Government. The hon. Gentleman concluded by saying how worried everyone is about those points, and sat down. I do not think they were a convincing series of arguments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith said things that were entirely untrue. I shall not mention his remarks about the community charge. I wishdraw that expression because I am not allowed to say it. Some of the things that the hon. Member for Hammersmith said, particularly about the community charge, were not in accordance with the facts. If I were to pursue the hon. Gentleman's remarks in too much detail, Mr. Hunt, you might stop me.<br><br>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that, far from being a regressive tax, the community charge has three examples of fairness. First, everybody pays their bit; secondly, those who cannot afford it receive help and, thirdly—this is what Opposition Members dislike most—Labour councils will be directly responsible to the electorate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith said that if the community charge went up or down, people would notice, ask about services and connect the cost with those services. That is precisely why the community charge is being introduced. I shall give an example of one mistake in the hon. Gentleman's speech, which I am sure he did not mean to make. The hon. Gentleman said that the rich man who lives alone in a big house will pay 15 times as much to local authorities than a poor man on supplementary benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, the hon. Gentleman did not say that, he said something quite untrue. The hon. Gentleman said he would pay half as much. It is 15 times as much. I am just correcting the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1037">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1121</span>
Member for Hammersmith on the facts. It is 15 times as much for the top 10 per cent. of earners against the bottom 100 per cent. of earners. That is an important point which explains why the hon. Gentleman gets his facts wrong about the community charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that a person who lives on his own will not pay half what two people who live next door will pay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that the rich man in the large house, whom the hon. Gentleman talked about, pays 15 times as much to the cost of local government as the poor man. That is the comparison.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hammersmith will be careful about this because yesterday the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) let the cat out of the bag. During Question Time, the hon. Member for Copeland admitted that Labour's two-tax alternative would have a rebate system and the hon. Gentleman bit the end of his tongue off, he was so ashamed of himself. At long last, and a bit too early because the elections are not over yet, the hon. Member for Copeland admitted that not only are there two taxes, but that there is a rebate system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members are going very wide of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr Hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minster give way? May I ask him something about the poll tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am anxious that we do not embark on a general debate on the community charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I should like to return to what the hon. Gentleman said. He obviously felt that local authorities should have no powers to charge for the services which they have now. I do not believe that the Association of Metropolitan Authorities would want that. The hon. Gentleman has had widespread consultation with the local authorities by letter, so he may also wonder whether the AMA would be keen on it.<br><br>
Clause 121 is very simple. It does not change the law, an important part of which was made under a Labour Government. We are saying only that in certain areas the Secretary of State may allow local authorities to charge, and they will decide whether they wish to do so.<br><br>
Insofar as there is a link with the community charge, it would be perfectly reasonable for a local authority, if it has the power, to decide to charge the recipients of a service rather than the whole community. That is local democracy. The authority makes up its own mind. In trying to find some wicked, subterranean link the hon. Member for Hammersmith has missed the obvious one.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1122</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is inconsistent. For example, local authorities have power under the Housing and Planning Act 1988 to sell off all its housing stock, and some stupid authorities have tried to do that. At that point the Secretary of State may decide that that is not appropriate and prevent them from doing so. How can the Minister uphold his argument if the Secretary of State can do that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because in that instance, the Secretary of State decides from the start whether it is an appropriate action. The Secretary of State decides in the first place whether it is appropriate to make charges in a particular area and then gives power to the local authorities to make a choice. They can exercise that power if they wish; it is up to them. That is perfectly reasonable, and it is how the clause operates. Opposition Members have made a very poor case against the clause. It is nowhere near as good a case as they have made on other clauses. I cannot understand why anyone should object to clause 121.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made it plain that he does not want minimum charges to be set, and that if the wording in the Bill is wrong, he will take it out. However, there is specific wording in clause 121 about setting minimum charges.<br><br>
In response to an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), the Minister tabled Amendment No. 714, which seeks to delete from clause 124 reference to clause 122(7) to (9), so he appears not to want minimum charging in the case of library services. Why, then, has he not removed minimum charging from the general provision to charge in clause 121?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the hon. Gentleman why. We did not want to allow local authorities to charge in circumstances where the charge would be merely an irritant and did not return any value to them, but I felt that if local authorities wanted to be so silly, they could stew in their own juice, and that it would be much better to take the provision out in case anybody should think that we wanted to make an imposition in a backhanded way. That is the only reason. If it is necessary to make changes in clause 122, we shall make them. There is nothing between the hon. Gentleman and I on this matter.<br><br>
There are arguments for saying that it would have been a useful provision to have, but I do not think that they are particularly good. The better argument is that I did not want anybody to think that our purpose is anything other than to give local authorities permission to charge when they think it is right. I do not want to mislead anybody, and that is why I have given the assurances which I have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I have a couple of points to make. First, it is of course possible for the poll tax to be reduced by 40 per cent. If 50 and 25 of the units of local tax are raised by the national non-domestic rate and the Government grant, and if a further 10 are raised by the fees, that reduces the poll tax to 15, and that makes a 40 per cent. reduction.<br><br>

More importantly, the Minister has still not dealt with some of the issues that are important to us. He has not totally reassured us, but I accept his undertaking to make sure that the clause deals with the first two points that we made. That is important, so I shall not press the amendment to a vote now. I shall wait to see what the Minister has to say on the Floor of the House and what my own advisers and other people say about the interpretation of the provision as it now stands. Then at that stage, if necessary, we shall return to the matter. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments have largely been answered by what the Minister has already said, but I should like him to make it clear that the Secretary of State would have no authority to impose a charge. I do not think that he would have, and I think that the Minister will agree, but the amendments would make that absolutely clear. I hope that the Minister can give an assurance on that and will accept the amendments to make that clear on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the reservation that I shall take away the clause, make sure that there are no grounds for the fears that have been expressed and if there are, put the clause right, I can say that there is no power to impose on a local authority the making of charges. Therefore, I agree with what the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said.<br><br>
There are problems with the wording of the amendments, but they are not worth discussing. It would be very odd to add to a clause words to the effect that it does not mean what it clearly does not mean, which is what the amendments would do. Therefore, I assure the hon. Gentleman that he need have no worries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but perhaps he could say why in clause 122(5) there is a specific reservation that nothing may be taken to require an imposition of a charge. If that reservation is necessary there, why is it not appropriate to have it in clauses 121 and 124?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The provision had to be drafted slightly differently because it applies to charging arrangements which are already allowed under previous Acts. I agreed to examine the wording, which must be different because it refers to previous Acts, and make it clear that the powers are not extended as the hon. Gentleman fears.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to its title, the clause involves the interpretation, consultation and commencement of clauses 121 and 122.<br><br>
There will be a major shift in the practice and presumption of local authority charges. The Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member of Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) was so breathtaking that I consider that he was looking for alibis. These clauses raise many questions, and the Minister said that he is not fully aware of what they entail in terms of the changes in local authority charging.<br><br>
The clauses replace the previous regime of charges for local authority services based on primary legislation. Some of the services now provided free or for certain charges by local authorities are to be included in a new charging regime. Clause 123 sets out the exceptions and clause 121 gives the Secretary of State the necessary power.<br><br>
We are worried about the danger of the powers that are being given to the Secretary of State. The notes on clauses say that the Secretary of State will have powers to prescribe charges by regulation, so he is being given tremendous power. We know his brass-necked attitude to local Government in many instances, which is why my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith was worried that the Bill does not define the changes in charges. We need clarification of the purpose of clauses 121, 122 and 123.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the power to allow local authorities to charge is not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
draconian? The power would be stronger if—it specifically does not—it allowed the Secretary of State the power to impose charges. The Secretary of State is taking only the power to allow local authorities to choose for themselves.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman think it terrible that his authority in Wakefield should be allowed to make up its own mind on whether to charge for a restricted range of services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But that is not what the Bill says. It says that the Secretary of State will have the power to prescribe charges or, in some instances, the level of charges, by regulation.<br><br>
The Minister says that that is not so. Then, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith said, we need such information included in the Bill. When the Bill is challenged the case will rest not on what the Minister says in <i>Hansard,</i> but on what is in the Bill. These issues must be made clear in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to read clause 121(1), which makes it absolutely clear that the power merely enables the Secretary of State to allow local authorities to charge in a particular area. I have given undertakings that if any part of the clause is misleading I shall try to redraft it in a clearer form. Opposition Members have no reason to comment further, because there is no more to the clause than that.<br><br>
We are saying only that the Secretary of State shall have the power to allow Wakefield district council and other authorities to decide whether to charge for a particular service or provision, sometimes up to a maximum limit. That is not a big change, and the hon. Member for Normanton must not over-egg it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we would get to the salmonella part of the Bill at some stage, and the Minister has led us to it. The poisoned provision is clause 121(6), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations may include such supplementary, incidental, consequential or transitional provisions as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient.".</p></blockquote>
That is a wide interpretation of the powers of the Secretary of State. If the provision does not mean what it says, why is it in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is covered by the main part of the clause, which says only that the power enables local authorities to charge. The provision is in that form because to give local authorities the power to charge we may have to make
<br><blockquote><p>"supplementary, incidental, consequential or transitional provisions".</p></blockquote>
We cannot make them unless they are subject to the overall statement that the only power that we have is to allow local authorities to charge.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton need have no worries. It is normal to be able to make such regulations in connection with giving the power to charge. There is no power to insist in local authorities charging, which is not the purpose of the Bill. If it were, we should have said so clearly. The only way to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
do so would be to take the appropriate powers clearly and unambiguously. We have no intention of taking them, so the hon. Member for Normanton need not worry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that the purpose of the Opposition is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To make life difficult for the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—to ensure that the Minister, the Secretary of State and Conservative Members do not short change people who rely on services provided by local government. I put it to the Minister. Has the Secretary of State powers to reduce the rate support grant to local authorities or to cap poll tax? Both actions influence charges for services that local authorities have to provide.<br><br>
I shall explain why I say that the Minister has been looking for alibis. The Secretary of State has tremendous powers. If he slices off contributions to local authorities by reducing the rate support grant, or tells them that no more money can be raised by poll tax, their only alternative if they are to maintain services is to increase charges. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Sheffield city council should not be able to charge for collection of refuse from business premises or for skip hire? If that applies in Sheffield, it must also apply in Normanton and Wakefield?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that that decision should be left to the freedom of the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not the interpretation of the Minister. His mischievous deceit on the issue is such that no Opposition Members accept his assurances. Indeed, I am sure that some Conservative Members do not accept the Minister's assurances. We have had so much of this procedure from the Tories in the past that no one trusts them on the issue of charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I acknowledge that the provisions are linked, but I am still waiting for the hon. Gentleman to relate his remarks to the specific amendments before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My purpose is to interpret the charges brought in under clauses 121 and 122. I seek to extract further assurances from the Minister. He has not convinced anyone that the Secretary of State will not use his powers to reduce the rate support grant or to cap the poll tax to ensure that charges will be increased. I give illustrations in amendment No. 771, which refers to education. The amendment would remove "in schools" from line 11. We are saying that functions relating to education shall be exempt from these regulations, for which there are reasons.<br><br>
If the provision is passed, many activities provided outside school hours, which are part of the curriculum, will have to be charged for.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
In January, while the Bill was being drafted, I received a letter from a D. F. Drake, chairman of governors at Ossett school in Ossett, part of my constituency. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Governors have also greatly valued the contribution, commitment and enthusiasm shown by the school staff to broaden the educational experiences of all pupils by making available a wide range of opportunities including:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) An annual First Year Humanities Curriculum visit to York."</p></blockquote>
That part of the curriculum will now have to be charged for by the authority. The list continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>b</i>) An annual Second Year 4 day Curriculum visit to France."</p></blockquote>
That has been helped by the local education authority and the parents, but will now be the full responsibility of the parents.
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>c</i>) Frequent English/Drama Curriculum Theatre visits."</p></blockquote>
That is important to the students.
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>d</i>) Frequent Curriculum trips/excursions for Field Work in History, Geography and Science and other subjects (all rendered even more necessary by the introduction of the G.C.S.E.)".</p></blockquote>
Those matters are important to education, but if the phrase "in schools" is retained in the clause, they will be subject to additional charges that do not exist currently.<br><br>
The list also specifies:
<br><blockquote><p>"Frequent residential experiences for pupils of all ages both under canvas and in hostels."</p></blockquote>
Local education authorities in our area have hostels on the moors and away from towns to give pupils additional educational experience. The list continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Other opportunities for off-site education including such valuable activities as caving, canoeing, and other similar activities."</p></blockquote>
People involved closely in such provision are worried that, because of the Government's attitude, they will be short changed in offering those activities to children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of what the hon. Gentleman said, which doubtless was written by that excellent headmaster, refers to the charges levied under the Education Reform Act 1988. The rest refers to a power of permission. If Wakefield district council has the power to charge for canoeing, chooses not to charge at present, but will start charging in future, that is a matter for the council. I do not understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. If the local council does not want to use that power, it does not have to. Why are we discussing the rights and wrongs of that power, when most of what the hon. Gentleman said concerns the Education Reform Act 1988?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the two pieces of legislation have resulted in some enveloping, as it has been termed. If the Minister believes what he says, why does he not accept the amendment to omit the phrase, "in schools"? If the power to charge is at the discretion of the local authority, why is it necessary now to include that in the Bill? The reason is surely that it is a sly way of ensuring that, because those activities are not taking place in schools, they must be charged for. That charge cannot be part of the poll tax and will not be included in the grant system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
It cannot be included in the community charge because the Secretary of State says that that must be limited to the community. If the status quo is to apply, and discretion remain with the local authority, why must that be specified in the Bill? If the Minister is sincere, he should accept our amendment, which would provide some regulation. Omitting "in schools" would help to ensure that the Minister's promises are fulfilled.<br><br>
Amendment No. 722 refers to the matter with which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith dealt. The position regarding the fire emergency services has not been clarified. If the status quo will apply and the fire services will have the authority to decide on the charges, why not accept the amendment, which would add the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and the provision of other emergency services by fire authorities"</p></blockquote>
to the clause? That would clear the issue, which is what the Minister has been trying to do, because our exact meaning would then be in the Bill. When we were discussing disabled people on Tuesday, I said to the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Mr. Trippier), that I would rather that we had a consensus on such matters instead of having Divisions on them.<br><br>
The Minister has assured us that there will be no difference in the practices and that the issue is clear. The amendment would add to that clarity and ensure that there was no doubt about what was intended.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 773 would make it abundantly clear that a local authority would not make an additional charge for household refuse collection, but that it would be included in the community charge, or poll tax. The amendment would also ensure that we would be free from tolls on the road—that there will be no taxes for people travelling the Queen's highway. More importantly, the amendment would ensure that there will be no charge for functions relating to personal social services. At present, people are being discharged from mental institutions and no local authority accommodation is provided for them. They have no alternative but to go into private homes and the families of those unfortunate people have to pay a premium.<br><br>
There are examples of people being charged for services, but not yet within local government. Will the Minister assure us that there will be no charge for the provision of personal social services? There is a danger that we are only one remove away from that happening. We shall have cause to distrust the provisions if we are not given assurances that our proposals will be included, and shall ask about the real meaning behind the Bill.<br><br>
The question of personal social services is very important. In addition to the Opposition Members who have raised the issue, on 1 February the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard) spoke about community care with regard to mentally ill people being cared for in the community. The hon. Lady said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that in all areas, there is one group of patients which the system is at present failing. They are either avoided or they are not offered adequate support when not resident in hospital. The problems they and their families encounter have been given useful publicity by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship and the campaigning group SANE".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 1 February 1989; Vol. 146, c. 402.]</p></blockquote>
No provision is currently made for that group of people, as the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West outlined. If the Minister is sincere, amendment No. 773 should be accepted so that no charges can be made for
<br><blockquote><p>"functions relating to personal social services."</p></blockquote>
A number of Members of Parliament are worried that the Government will introduce charges for providing those services.<br><br>
We are submitting the amendments because of our concern and the concern of people outside the House. If the Minister is sincere about the status quo, it should be in the Bill. Then there will be no problem with interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to discuss amendments Nos. 557–560 on the functions relating to road users. The powers to charge road users have always been carefully circumscribed in legislation, and it is not clear at first sight whether some of the Bill's provisions could be extended to them, as they are drafted in wide terms.<br><br>
Amendment No. 557 relates to the removal, delivery, disposal, custody or immobilisation of vehicles. It has been suggested that the regulations would authorise charges to be paid only by a person who requests a service or document. That would rule out any application to wheel clamping or vehicle removal as covered by the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, because few people request that their vehicles should be clamped. As those services are explicitly mentioned in subsection (1)(f), regulations could apply to them and to other comparable cases where a local authority acts, for instance, to remedy a nuisance and charges the person who causes it.<br><br>
The Department of Transport has advised that any question of changing the basis of charging for removals and wheel clamping, for instance charging the actual cost rather than a prescribed fee, requires consultation with the Home Office, the police and local authorities. The Home Office is currently responsible for prescribing the fee and it would be for it to initiate any change.<br><br>
Organisations that represent road users, such as the Automobile Association, believe that charges relating to removal and wheel clamping of vehicles should continue to be governed by the existing statutory provisions contained in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978, and regulations made thereunder. The amendment is designed to secure those objectives.<br><br>
Amendment No. 558 relates to off and on-street parking charges. It is a probing amendment and follows the wide terms in which clauses 121 and 122 are drafted. Local authorities want easier ways to vary parking charges rather than greater discretion on what to charge. They already have considerable discretion. The Department of Transport's view is that such a procedural change would go wider than the scope of the Bill, although that is not immediately
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1130</span>
clear from the wording of the clause. At present, local authorities must advertise and consult before making or varying off and on-street parking charges by means of a parking order. Those requirements are prescribed in the relevant Traffic Procedure Regulations under the Road Traffic Regulations Act. The amendment would elicit information from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about his intentions with regard to the use of the Bill to make or vary parking charges.<br><br>
Amendment No. 559 is designed to prevent my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State from making regulations under clauses 121 or 122 giving local authorities the power to charge tolls on roads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stop frightening people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is well known that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport is due to publish a document on the provision of private capital in transport schemes. It is premature to introduce a power before we have any information on the Government's future strategy on the matter.<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 560 is about consultation with organisations representing road users. Regulations under clauses 121 and 122 are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and clause 123(6) provides that, before exercising any power to make regulations, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State must consult representatives of local government. He is not required to consult road user organisations. That is wrong if the regulations seek to impose charges that may affect many millions of road users. If the provisions impose charges on road users, organisations representing road users should be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) was so clear and precise in introducing the amendments that there is little left for me to say. I am grateful to him for that, as I have had a particularly hair-raising drive from Leicester this morning.<br><br>
During the short time that I have been here this morning, it has already been put to me that, by tabling amendment No. 559 I want to impose tolls on roads all over the country. It may be opportune to point out that the amendment seeks to leave with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State the power to make regulations. It is not intended to suggest that there is about to be a burst of putting tolls on roads throughout the country, but as the clause is drafted, that interpretation could apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to repeat that the purpose of our powers under these clauses enables, not forces, local authorities to charge. I repeat that because the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) used phrases that implied an element of force. When he was pressed on the matter, he accepted that the Government did not have those powers, nor did we seek them, but nevertheless he produced a scenario that I found very unlikely.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I would say, for

example, "Wakefield district council is not charging for videos. The Minister of Libraries should be called in so that we can discuss the matter and decide how to make Wakefield charge for videos." The scenario continued: "We cannot make Wakefield charge because we do not have the necessary powers, so we will work out how to operate the needs grant on Wakefield to force it to charge for videos."<br><br>
Apart from the lunacy of that proposal, such a course would not be possible because the system does not work in that way. Furthermore, such a course would be subject to judicial review because a distinction would have been made between two councils, but not on grounds of need. The purpose of the needs grant is to meet needs.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has produced a scenario that could have come only from him. Only he could have invented it and I congratulate him on it. I have examined the clauses and the amendments, but I never thought of the merry meetings that the hon. Gentleman envisages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister of a meeting that was held in his office with members of the west and south Yorkshire fire services, who explained how cuts in rate support grant were affecting their services. The Minister looked. He did not alter his expression, which implied, "There is nothing for you". Yet the Secretary of State and the Minister manipulated the rate support grant to reduce the services provided by the west and south Yorkshire fire services. That same principle will apply on other aspects—including videos, if the Minister wishes to use that analogy. The principle is set; I know because I have seen the Minister at work and I know how he operates. Because of the devious way in which he makes announcements, the rate support grant cut order and poll-tax capping will leave local authorities in an invidious position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have attended the meeting and may have understood how the Minister's mind works but, clearly he did not understand what was happening. I will explain. He asked for the system to be manipulated. He came to us and said, "The system that you have applied to everyone else does not suit us in west Yorkshire, so please disapply it and manipulate it to our advantage?" In my devious way, I had to reply, "I can't. The law does not allow me to." I am sorry. As much as I should like to help the hon. Gentleman because I understand his case, I cannot do it." I say again to the hon. Member for Normanton that I could not do it because it would have been against the law. The hon. Gentleman suggests that I could invent a system whereby—</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The law is governed by the principle that there would be a judicial review if powers were used to disadvantage one class of authority and not another. The hon. Gentleman asked me to disadvantage other authorities so as to advantage his. I know
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
that he is a good Member of Parliament and his function is to come to me and explain his argument. But his present proposal would have an opposite effect to his earlier one. His example proved my point. I cannot do what he thought I could. It is not that I would not. The idea that I would spend my time worrying about video prices in Wakefield is so preposterous that the hon. Gentleman ought not to suggest it. I ask him not to propose what cannot happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As so often happens, the Minister has misled the Committee. I will expalin why. When the deputation visited the Minister, it was made clear to him and his officers that the metropolitan counties had worked out a formula and asked him to apply it. The Minister of needs—as he calls himself from time to time—found that he had not got the needs system right. Again, the needs element in these proposals will be decided by him alone. The needs of Wakefield, Bradford and Leeds will therefore be decided by him. That is the manipulation of which I accused the Minister. It is not the law, it is his interpretation of it. Therein lies the danger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got it wrong again. However we decide, in consultation with local authorities, the decision about a measure must ultimately be applied equally to all authorities. It cannot be done any other way because that is how the English system works, and has done for many years. I cannot change it even if I wanted to, and I do not. The hon. Gentleman must not trail these fictitious concepts. I shall long remember the invitation to consider video prices in Wakefield.<br><br>
The amendments propose changes to the Bill because of a mistaken concept. Local authorities will, in certain instances, be allowed to charge for some of the services they provide. There are to be clear exemptions and exceptions, but cases may arise. When they do local authorities will make up own minds about whether to charge. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) pointed out, Sheffield city council at present charges for a number of services. The council feels that it ought to charge for them, it has the power to charge for them, and other opportunities may arise in line with that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton spoke, first, about fire services, and I think that I have dealt with that subject in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first amendment dealt with education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, but I am dealing with the amendments in the order in which I have them here. I am sure that it does not matter greatly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton spoke about fire services, because the hon. Member for Hammersmith had already discussed education at length. I do not wish to accept the amendment, because its effect would be the opposite of what he imagines. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton is listening, because it is an important issue.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am giving the Minister the same attention that he gave me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must notice how much attention I gave him, because I have dealt with each of his points with great directness, and he may even be embarrassed by the directness with which I remember his phrases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is amused. I meant to be amusing, and I hope to continue in that vein.<br><br>
The only difference that amendment No. 772 would make would be to withdraw the Secretary of State's powers to reduce the ability of local authorities to charge for fire services. It may not be a terribly important power, but if Opposition Members are worried that some local authorities might charge—under legislation that was introduced by the Labour party—for things for which they should not charge, it is very odd that they seek to remove the one power in the Bill that gives the Secretary of State the opportunity to stop them doing that. It is clear that the hon. Member for Normanton has not read the clause carefully enough to understand how it works. So I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment. It is contrary to the hon. Gentleman's intentions, and no doubt he will wish to withdraw it in due course.<br><br>
Now I come to education. The phrase "education in schools" is a technical phrase which in legal terms, covers all education—school pupils and adults, in nursery schools, primary schools, secondary schools and special schools. That is what the phrase means, and there is no question of it allowing charges which cannot be made at present for nursery schools. The phrase refers to the Education Reform Act 1988. There is no need for worry on that score.<br><br>
The only other things that might be allowed, if the Secretary of State so decided, would be, for instance, where a local education authority wanted to charge for canoeing. All the arguments that the hon. Member for Normanton advanced about the importance of canoeing and other things—I do not disagree with him; they are wonderful opportunities, and I very much hope that they would be available for my children—and all the arguments that he advanced against paying for such things would be properly advanced in any education committee in any part of the country, if we gave that power. But the hon. Gentleman is saying that at no time and on no grounds shall local education committees be allowed to decide this issue for themselves. He argues that it is a decision that should never be made except nationally and wholly by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.<br><br>
I find that proposal quite preposterous. It is perfectly reasonable to say that if the Secretary of State thinks it reasonable, he will leave it to the local authorities to decide. The Secretary of State must decide whether it is reasonable, although I do not know whether he would, because I am not competent to judge. No doubt the Secretary of State will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
happy to discuss the matter. I do not know his view on it, and I do not think that he has any plans in that regard. Perhaps he does want to do it, but he will not tell people that they have to do it. He will have the power to tell Wakefield education authority, "If you want to do it, you can." If the headmaster of Osset school and the education authority are against that they will not do it. At the moment, they do not have the power to take that decision.<br><br>
I do not understand how one can take the view that local authorities do not have enough power, and, yet, at the same time, say that they should never be allowed to take a decision of that type. If the hon. Member for Normanton is against it because he believes that the Government will force education authorities to charge, I must tell him that I have no power to do that. I only have the power to allow them to charge.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman want us to use the power? If he does, will he trust Wakefield education authority? From what he has said about Wakefield, I believe that he would be prepared to trust that authority as I would trust Suffolk education authority. However, it is odd to refuse the Secretary of State the power to allow other people to make a choice. That is centralism gone mad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister is saying that the decision should be left to the local authority. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Will he assure us that the Bill will provide that Wakefield, or any other, district council will not be "poll-tax capped" if the Minister feels that the services that it gives to the people in the area are not excessive? If the matter is to be decided by the local authority, it should not be directed by the Minister or the Secretary of State. If the Minister means that he will not prevent an authority providing transport to school, after-hours activities and social service facilities, and charging the community for them, that is all right. However, he must clarify that point now because he has not said that before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, the hon. Gentleman accused me of not listening to him. I have listened to him and shall continue to do so, but I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is listening to me. I have said many times that there is no power under the clauses for the Secretary of State to instruct local authorities to do anything. The only power that he has is that of restricting the degree to which they can charge in the circumstances in which he has given them that permission. The hon. Gentleman must accept what is in the Bll. When the hon. Member for Hammersmith suggested that a phrase might be misleading, I said that I would consider it to see whether that was so. I cannot do more than that.<br><br>
I think a fox has been shot. Some hon. Members have arrived in Commttee and, for reasons that I shall not express, tried to convey to the press and others the impression that the Government would force charges on people. I suspect that that attempt relates to what is happening next Thursday. It has not got much to do with the Bill. Once it became apparent that they would not be able to pin that on the Government because it is not true, a great deal of flailing of arms, chasing about and an attempt to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1135</span>
discover another hunt took place. Scarecrow politics is under way. The hon. Member for Normanton is a pastmaster at that and I do not know anyone else who is so adept at hiding a small crumb of truth beneath so many sentences.<br><br>
I shall say of him what was once said of Charles Dickens—he never used two sentences when five paragraphs would do. We had a good example of that today. The Government's simple proposition is for the Secretary of State to have the power to allow local authorities, when appropriate, to charge for services for which they do not charge now. That is the draconian proposition, but I am sure that ordinary people would accept it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) raised interesting points which were addended to by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire). It would be inappropriate to use the Bill to introduce tolls. I give an unequivocal undertaking that that is not our intention. I am loath to add further exceptions. As a matter of fact it could not be done because it is a complicated business and would involve much discussion. Most of us have made no judgment about whether it would be appropriate or possible in certain circumstances. Discussions on that matter are still in their early stages.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
The subject of vehicles and the way in which they are dealt with was raised. I liked the example of the mythical individual. I am surprised that it did not come from the hon. Member for Normanton who might have suggested that some people want to have their vehicles clamped. That is about as likely as my discussing videos in Wakefield. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley was kind enough to suggest that that was an unlikely proposition.<br><br>
The Government have no plans to depart from the present arrangements under which the Home Secretary sets the charges. That is obviously the sensible and proper approach. All I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley is that for some marginal matters—not those to which he referred—the generality of this provision may be appropriate. I assure him that what he is worried about will not be proposed by the Government.<br><br>
My hon. Friend proposes that we consult road users. I hope that he will not press his amendment because it would require us to consult road users when considering whether to allow local authorities to charge for sex shop licences, and I am sure that he would consider that inappropriate. If discussions were of importance to road users, I give him an undertaking that we would consult their representatives.<br><br>
I do not accept Amendment No. 772 because the clauses empower the Secretary of State to allow local authorities to have differential charging. An authority may want differential charging for a library that has an extensive programme for lending items other than just books, or for blind people, old people or those who are incapacitated. But in some circumstances it would be unsuitable for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
Secretary of State to allow differential charges, for example for the licensing of sex shops. The Secretary of State should have a choice in those matters and I am sure that he would use that power in a generally acceptable way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his assurances about the Government's lack of intentions about changes for road users. I am reluctant to have hostages to fortune placed on the statute book, because they may be used by some future Government to give local authorities, which may be prejudiced against private vehicles, powers to impose charges on them. I would much rather see those provisions stated in transport legislation.<br><br>
It is clear from the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, that charges relating to road users apply to a generality or road users, extending far beyond the boundaries of local authorities, therefore, should not be subject to the whims of individual councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I do not think that his worries are well founded. I am happy to discuss them with him, and if, together, we find that we should make a change I shall do so. I remain unconvinced because as one adds to the list of matters that are reasonable or unreasonable, a knock-on effect is produced. If my hon. Friend convinces me that something needs to be changed, I shall consider that change.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1137</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not extend the debate to include you, Mr. Hunt. I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) will recognise the advisability of not doing so.<br><br>
This important group of amendments intends to establish the principle that the personal inspection of records, which local authorities hold under the Local Government (Records) Act 1962, should be free. I am speaking on behalf of the London Archives Users Forum which was established to represent the interests of public and private record offices in the London area, including those services run as part of the public libraries that could be affected by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patnick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the idea of the local authority's records on an electorate, being available on demand. The amendment is too widely drafted. Will my hon. Friend be specific?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that as I continue, my hon. Friend will see the thrust of my argument. We are essentially dealing with archival material. Numerous people may wish to refer to that sort of information from time to time.<br><br>
The London Archive Users Forum represents some 15,000 potential and actual users of record offices. The amendments would clarify the Bill because, in its present form, it does not protect written archival material from potential charges for personal inspection, although if a transcript is made and placed on a library shelf, a charge could not be made for its inspection. The forum makes it clear that it is not opposed to charges for various ancillary services offered by record offices, such as copying services and search fees for people who choose not to visit record offices and libraries in person.<br><br>
Amendment No. 561 would insert a new paragraph into clause 123, which sets out a range of "excepted functions" in relation to which the Secretary of State will not have power to make regulations about charges under clauses 121 and 122. The new paragraph is designed to establish the principle that personal inspection of records held by local authorities under the Local Government (Records) Act 1962 should be free. That is already the case for many types of current records, either because the authorities have no express power to charge or because legislation such as my Local Government (Access to Information) Act 1985—cause for blowing my own trumpet—distinguishes between inspection, which is largely free, and being supplied with copies, for which a charge may be made.<br><br>
That is not necessarily the case in respect of historical records in the control of local authorities. Under the 1962 Act, authorities have the discretion to charge for inspection as well as copying. That sits rather ill with the provisions of clauses 123 and 124, which establish that education and the basic public library services are to be free. Access to archives is often indistinguishable from the educational and informational purposes that we have already discussed.<br><br>
The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from making regulations under clause 122 to regulate authorities' existing powers to charge.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
Coupled with amendment No. 564, it would also remove the inspection of records from the scope of clause 121. If the principle of amendment No. 561 were accepted, amendment No. 564 would be consequential. Its effect would be to remove the existing power under the 1962 Act to charge for the inpsection of records. However, it would retain what the forum and I consider to be the justified powers to levy reasonable charges in the circumstances that I have already outlined. In practice, the principal records that will be affected will be archives collected and deposited with recognised archive authorities under section 2 of the Act, and other records in the control of the authority whose use it may promote under section 1. In no way do the amendments affect existing restrictions on access to records in authorities' custody, whether they come from statute of from the terms on which deposits of archives have been made.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 562 and 563 seek to extend the class of material to be protected from charges under new section 8, which clause 124 seeks to insert in the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964. For practical purposes, they are designed to deal with the circumstances envisaged in new subsections (4) of that section, which deals with consultation of material held by a library on the premises, as opposed to the lending of that material.<br><br>
In many places, particularly the metropolitan areas, original documentary material held for purposes such as local studies is housed in and organised as part of the library service. In other words, many reference libraries hold archives and make them available for study on the premises. As drafted, the Bill does not protects such material from charges. The definition of written material in section 8(7) of the 1964 Act protects mass-produced material, such as books and pamphlets, but not original material.<br><br>
It would be illogical if authorities were precluded from charging under their archive powers, but able to do so if similar material were available in a public library. It would also be illogical if an authority were precluded from charging for the inspection of the published transcript of a document, but could charge for inspection of the document itself. Amendment No. 562 would extend the definition of written material so that an authority can no more charge for the inspection of an original document than for a transcript of it. The term "record" is used in the amendment because it is consistent with that used in the Local Government (Records) Act 1962.<br><br>
If the amendments were accepted, authorities could not charge for allowing people to inspect filmed or photographed copies of documents any more than for the documents themselves. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister is aware that there is a central difficulty about the current forms of archives because of technological progress. I am trying to get the ball rolling and to show that serious students and archivists are worried. I hope that my right, hon. Friend will respond.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with my hon. Friend. The material that he is talking about is material that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I1046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
both of us have used at different times and have found most valuable. Our joint desire is to try to ensure that the material is available. My hon. Friend is right to say that one of our central problems is achieving consistency and that it is difficult to frame the arrangements when one has to deal with new and rapidly changing technologies. A suitable clause today may be wholly inappropriate in a relatively short time.<br><br>
I should perhaps have admitted an historical interest in that I am a publisher by profession, particularly in the microfilm and modern technique area. I have been out of that since joining the Government and the world which used to be part of my daily experience has wholly changed because of advances in technology. I do not want to damn out of hand my hon. Friend's amendments, but I cannot accept them for a fundamental technical reason. In cases like this one has to rely on what lawyers say is likely to be upheld in the courts, it is thought that these amendments would prevent authorities from charging, not only for books, journals, pamphlets and copies of such material, but for video and computer tapes, compact discs and audio recordings and tapes which set out facts, events and information. That was not his itention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are back to videos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are. This is an area of considerable worry, but I cannot accept the amendments. My hon. Friend says that archives are largely free. That is true, but they can also largely be charged for. That is not because of this Bill, but is a result of earlier legislation. The amendments would restrict the right of local authorities to charge for material for which they have had the right to charge for a long time. I can see that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch may wish that to happen. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts may decide that he wants to use his power and restrict that right. That would not be done without considerable consultation with local authorities. It would be at that stage that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and his archivist friends should draw those points to the attention of my right hon. Friend. That is the right moment to do it. In itself the clause does not change much the amount of charging which as my hon. Friend said, has not been widely used.<br><br>
I would be a little worried about how the restrictions would work, even if I felt that they were appropriate to the Bill. I can imagine circumstances in which authorities that are not keen on their archives—for example because they contain fragile material and are expensive to maintain—may say that they will not pay to make it available anyway. There is a real problem if the proposal is taken out of context. I do not blame my hon. Friend because it is his vehicle for drawing the matter to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts, but there must be a balance. Removing any possibility of charging may prevent material, which would otherwise have been available, being available. Insistence on making material available and the powers to charge do not entirely overlap and there may therefore be difficulties.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which my right hon. Friend has approached the amendments. I am a self-confessed user of archives and archive material. A way round the problem might be to encourage libraries to charge for the sale of tapes, photographs and so on, while leaving reference and access to information as a free service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend might put that argument to my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts during consultation. My hon. Friend underlines my misgivings about the amendments. They extend the prohibitions to precisely what he and I might think should provide the cost-centre to cover what we want to be free. This is particularly difficult set of amendments. I undertake to write to my right hon. Friend the Minster for the Arts and tell him what my right hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) said. I shall underline my hon. Friend's last comment and suggest that the Minister for the Arts invites him to make representations on behalf of the archivists or on his own behalf. That is probably the best way in which to deal with the problem. The amendments have faults which mean that they will achieve the opposite of what my hon. Friend wants them to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Squire</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the way in which the amendments were discussed. In view of my right hon. Friend's undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should not be so dismissive of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The Minister said that the phrase, "centralism gone mad" could apply to what my hon. Friend proposed. Most of this Bill is centralism gone mad. Much of it confers wide-ranging powers on the Secretary of State although, at this stage, Ministers deny that they are likely to use them.<br><br>
My hon. Friends and I, who have had many years of experience in local government, are aware that there have been occasions when, through the rate support grant mechanism and financial restraints, or by other methods, the Government could have imposed charges, or whatever, on local authorities. I am grateful to the Minister for admitting that that is not only unlikely, but illegal, under the present regime, and that local authorities will not be told to charge as a direct consequence of the rate support grant, or the new revenue support grant, mechanisms.<br><br>
The amendments refer to that by stating that the details under clause 122, which cause such confusion in the Minister's mind, and are the subject of the debate, ought not to apply to library charges. Amendment No. 775 seeks to ensure, by the additions contained in the amendment, that any charges likely to be made under clause 122 would not occur. Clause 124 should be self-contained so that library charges, and everything pertaining to libraries, come within it. Clause 122, which is the subject of considerable disagreement, would then have no effect on the charges under clause 124.<br><br>
I shall be grateful to the Minister if he will reply to those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) for the pleasant way in which he moved the amendment and for his comments. There is disagreement between us about which of the two major parties is most centralising. I always found that Socialism, by its nature, is centralising whereas Conservatism, by its nature, disperses power. Conservatives are in Parliament to spread to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
many the privileges that were once available only to the few. Socialism, to me, is about taking from people what privileges they have and centralising them in the state. That is the difference between us, but this is not the Committee in which to discuss the matter.<br><br>
We have received representations from library and local government associations, but the power to specify in regulations a specific or minimum charge, or to prescribe rules about what charges should be imposed, is contrary to the spirit of the Government's intention to give library authorities the discretion to decide whether to impose authorised charges. There are limits only on the maximum amount charged.<br><br>
We accept that the hon. Gentleman's argument has force and that the discretion given in the Bill might be more limited than is desirable, so we have tabled Amendments Nos. 714 and 715 to correct matters. Our fears, and those of the hon. Member for Torfaen on this subject, are not wildly different.<br><br>
We consider it right to preserve the Secretary of State's power to set a maximum on the amount of any charge because we think it is in the interests of the library user to prevent library authorities from charging undesirably high charges for facilities. Such as obtaining and notifying the availability of a reserved book.<br><br>
I represent a rural constituency. At one end there is a large urban area, but the rural part is extensive. It has 54 miles of coastline. Reserving a book from a travelling library is an important part of the way in which the library service works. Not many of my constituents would object to paying for that service, provided that the charge was reasonable. I am sure that my local authority and, I hope, other local authorities would not impose an unreasonable charge, but it is not unreasonable to give the Secretary of State the power to set a maximum.<br><br>
The Government amendments cover the realities—</span></p>
