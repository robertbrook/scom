[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] We decided to meet here partly because it was hot; if the heat returns we shall appreciate this more spacious Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one appeal. The acoustics here may not be as good as they are in other Committee Rooms, so I ask hon. Members to speak up, not only for the convenience of the Chairman but particularly for the convenience of 	<i>Hansard</i> and therefore for hon. Members immortality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall meet here for the rest of this week and the whole of next week; during that period I shall welcome hon. Members' opinions on whether they find the Room convenient. It may become the regular meeting place for the Finance Bill Committee in view of the problems that occur on Thursdays because of party meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr Peter Brooke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I allude, in as loud a voice as I can manage, to the pleasure of being in this Room under your chairmanship, Mr. Cormack? The previous time that I was here, I was the Government Whip on the Local Government Finance (No. 2) Bill. Because of an event that occurred—not in this Room but due to the fact that we had been in it—and due to what I shall describe not as a ruse but as a strategy of the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley), my ministerial career almost ended quickly. Fortunately I survived and I am delighted, nine years later, to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I say a word or two about the most substantial change that has been made in schedule 4 as an introduction to this part of the Bill. In 1987, we introduced an important tax relief to encourage employees to make part of their pay profit-related. Registration of profit-related pay schemes started in the autumn of 1987, and by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
end of March the number of live schemes had already reached 869 covering more than 122,000 employees. Although I know that the impatient have described that progress as disappointing, the Government see it as clear evidence that the benefits to both employers and employees of flexible pay arrangements linked to profits are becoming more widely known. We have succeeded in stimulating a widespread debate among employers, employees and professional advisers about the need to break rigidities in the British pay system. The provision of the tax relief has prompted considerable interest among employers in creating or developing various profit-sharing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, such an innovative tax relief has also stimulated detailed criticisms. Because we sought to allow employers reasonable flexibility in the design, introduction and operation of their profit-related pay schemes, the legislation is necessarily fairly substantial and appears complex. At the same time, it was essential, if we were to ensure that the tax relief was directed effectively towards the objectives that we intended, that the legislation should contain certain basic requirements. Perhaps, not surprisingly, some employers have found that, in the particular circumstances of their organisations, one or other of the safeguards is inconvenient to them and there have been calls to make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we needed time for PRP to settle down and for everyone—both employers and their advisers and the Inland Revenue—to gain experience of how things were working. That is why we deliberately refrained from making any changes last year. Now, in the light of general experience of the first 18 months' operation of PRP, of comments and suggestions received and answers to our questions, we have carefully reviewed the scheme and we have concluded that certain improvements can and should be made, The changes are designed further to increase employers' flexibility and choice in the design of their schemes and at the same time to simplify the requirements as far as possible while ensuring that PRP continues to serve the purposes underlying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to go into detail on the five significant changes and the group of minor changes, but I wish to mention the material interest test—not least because it comes up in subsequent clauses with which my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will deal. My introductory remarks may be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees who have a material interest in their company cannot participate in a registered PRP scheme. In deciding whether an employee has a material interest, the shareholdings of the trustees of a trust under which he may benefit are at present taken into account. Paragraph 9 of the schedule provides that, in future, in certain circumstances they should be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar changes to the material interest rules are being made for employee share schemes and close company interest relief. The employee share ownership plans provisions also include a material interest test, which is consistent with this change. It may therefore be helpful in considering the change in paragraph 9 to bear in mind its wider relevance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help if I explain briefly what the material interest test is and the reasons for having it.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
Employees who have a sizeable or "material" interest in their company cannot participate in registered PRP schemes or approved employee share schemes. For PRP—as for all-employee share schemes—that means an interest in more than 25 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the company. For discretionary share schemes, it means an interest in more than 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons for the material interest tests. First, they seek to ensure that the various tax reliefs associated with the schemes cannot be manipulated to their own advantage by those who, by virtue of substantial holdings in the company, may be in a position to do so. Secondly, there would be no justification in giving valuable tax reliefs to people who already have a substantial identification with the success of the business through their existing interest in it. There is probably nothing in the principle underlying the test with which any members of the Committee would wish to disagree. A material interest test featured in the 1978 legislation, brought in by the previous Labour Government, covering approved profit-sharing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For obvious reasons, the legislation requires that in addition to the individual's own shares, those of his associates have to be reckoned in deciding whether he has a material interest. As the law stands, if the employee has an interest in a trust that holds some of the company's ordinary shares, the trustees are included among his associates and their shareholding has to be added to his and that of his other associates, if any, in determining whether he has a material interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a rule is clearly appropriate for certain sorts of trusts, for example, where a substantial part of the shares in a family company are held by a trust essentially for the benefit of a few members of the family. But counting trustees' shares can mean that some employees may not participate in PRP or employee share schemes, even though their interest in a trust is in reality remote or small, for example, where a trust has been set up for the benefit of all the employees of quite a large company, and where the benefits that they actually receive or may receive, individually, are small. That difficulty was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) during last year's Finance Bill debates, when my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary undertook to consider whether relaxations might be possible in the material interest tests for PRP and share schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in this year's bill seek to resolve that difficulty by allowing shares held by an employee benefit trust to be ignored in calculating an employee's interest, provided that certain conditions are met. The form that the relaxation takes is exclusion of the trustees from the associates of the employee concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is not easy to find a sensible path between the two extremes that I have mentioned—the family trust benefiting only a few, and the much wider trust benefiting individuals only to a very small extent. The solution that we have adopted, aimed at providing a relaxation that will apply to as many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
trusts as possible, is a novel one. Rather then looking at what a trust is empowered to do, which involves attributing to each beneficiary the trustees' total interest—which has been the approach hitherto—we now propose that account should be taken of what the trustees actually do, in distributing benefits to beneficiaries. That seems a more reasonable approach, which takes account of the realities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it would be helpful to make those general introductory remarks, but on the rest of the schedule, it may be easier if I reply to points raised by hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, I associate myself with the remarks of the Paymaster General, in thanking the Serjeant at Arms and his staff for making this Room available to us. It is a vast improvement on the confined rigours of Committee Room 9. I shall trespass a touch on your patience, Mr. Cormack, by saying that the only event that may edge us out of this Room in two or three weeks' time is the start of proceedings on the King's Cross Railways Bill, in which I have a strong, keen and acerbic interest. I hope that we shall continue to use this Room so that the King's Cross Railways Bill is long delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reflecting on the way in which profit-related pay was introduced. It was first announced in principle in the Chancellor's Budget statement of 1986 and it was fleshed out in detail in the Budget and Finance Bill in 1987. The motives behind its introduction were interesting. In his Budget speech in 1986, the Chancellor attributed considerable virtues to profit-related pay. The major motives for introducing it, as defined in that speech, were, first, that it would enable a major reduction in unit labour costs—unit labour costs were identified as a principal weakness in the British economy. Secondly, it would provide considerable flexibility for both employers and employees when an enterprise went through good and bad times. Thirdly, it would reduce the inflationary effect of increases in wages, and finally it would give employees a personal stake in the profitability of the company for which they worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those motives are to be welcomed, but it is noticeable that profit-related pay has subsequently fallen far short of those principles and aims. The aims spelt out at that stage assumed that profit-related pay would be a fundamental and major part of an employee's income rather than a top-up bonus. That principle was enshrined in the 5 per cent. rule, which stipulated that at least 5 per cent. of an employee's income had to be part of the PRP scheme before tax relief became operative. The 5 per cent. rule is being abandoned, and I shall return to that point shortly because it is the most revealing and important change being made in schedule 4. However, the supposed flexibility and incentive effect, which the Chancellor spelt out at the launch of the idea of profit-related pay in 1986, has failed to materialise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General—I suspect, a little tongue in cheek—told us that profit-related pay had been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
an important change. He said that there was clear evidence that the benefits were becoming more widely known and that it was an innovative form of tax relief. He referred to the figures for take-up, which are instructive. If we consider the number of schemes registered and the number of employees covered by them, we see that take-up is very low. At the end of December 1988, there were 830 registered schemes covering 122,400 employees. That was an increase of 15,100 on the previous quarter, but it is still a relatively small number of the employees in the total work force. A quarter later, at the end of March this year, the latest figures available show that there are 869 registered schemes and that the number of employees has far from increased. It went down marginally in the quarter to March 1989, by 300, to 122,100 employees. That is a reduction over the previous three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show that the scheme is not a major innovation that is being taken up on a wide scale and that it is not proving to be of enormous benefit to industry. If we compare the figures with the predictions that the Chancellor made, we see how far short of expectations PRP has fallen. In the 1987 Budget statement, the Chancellor said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cost will inevitably depend on take-up. It could be"—</p></blockquote>
Admittedly, he used the conditional tense, but it was a bullish Chancellor making reasonably confident predictions about the level of take-up—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could be £50 million in 1988–89, building up to substantially more than that, as take-up grows, and as the proportion of an employee's pay which is profit-related rises."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 March 1987; Vol. 112, c. 823.]</p></blockquote>
Note that the government are not now encouraging raising the proportion of an employee's pay that can be included in a PRP scheme, but are seeking to reduce it by removing the 5 per cent. threshold rule. That predicted figure of £50 million in 1988–89 must also be set against the actual figure of £15 million, which profit-related pay cost the Exchequer in that financial year. The changes in the schedule are estimated to add a further £10 million to that bill. That is far short of the Chancellor's confident expectations when he launched the scheme in detail in the 1987 Budget. The take-up has been disappointing for the Chancellor, whose friends in industry are deserting him on whether profit-related pay has the incentive effect that he claimed it would have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey conducted by Incomes Data Services suggests that most companies with registered schemes are small and in the finance, management consultancy and design sectors of the economy. The three largest participants, which account for some one fifth of employees covered by PRP schemes, are Nationwide Anglia Building Society, Gallaher and Norwich Union Insurance Group. The IDS survey of employers in the autumn of 1987 suggests that even the companies participating in the scheme had considerable doubts about the incentive effect of profit-related pay. The survey says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The incentive effect of PRP is being questioned by some companies."</p></blockquote>
It is clear to us that profit-related pay is being used
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
not as a fundamental part of employees' earnings, not as the incentive motive that the Government claimed that it would be, not as the flexible means of taking employers and employees through good times and bad times, but as a tax-free bonus operation to make available additional funds to employees on the margin. The changes in the schedule do nothing to diminish that view of PRP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of the 5 per cent. rule takes away the entire basis on which profit-related pay was launched and means that it can be used as a top-up of any kind in relation to earnings. It does not have to be a substantial part of the earnings of an employee. I might accept the argument, which the Government have not yet made, that the 5 per cent. threshold made it difficult to get schemes off the ground, that meeting that threshold was a substantial step facing an employer and an employee, and that to assist schemes to get off the ground, the disincentive effect of the 5 per cent. rule should be reconsidered. But then we must question why the entire 5 per cent. rule is being removed. Why not try a stepping mechanism for new schemes, so that where a firm or an employee first adopts PRP, the 5 per cent. threshold should not apply, but should come into operation within, say, two years? That might be a sensible way to tackle the starting-off problem. But instead of that the Government have decided to scrap the whole principle. That is not a wise step because it means that PRP will be diverted entirely from the supposed fundamental values that the Chancellor had in launching it three years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much concern about the removal of the 5 per cent. rule. Will the Government consider a stepping mechanism as an alternative to the total removal that they propose? Secondly, the inclusion of head office and headquarters staff within PRP schemes, as proposed in the schedule, throws considerable doubt on the supposed incentive effects. The principle of PRP was that those directly involved in the production of profit should be reminded of that in their wage packet. That principle of direct involvement is being breached by the schedule. The inclusion of all employees within an enterprise, including those not directly involved in the production of profit, is not a particularly sensible way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a few questions about the changes to the material interest test, which the Paymaster General expanded on at some length. We accept the principle underlying the test. The Paymaster General was absolutely right when he said that there was almost certainly no disagreement on both sides of the Committee about that. We have no objection to the principle of the test, nor do we have any objection in principle to the removal of consideration for the shareholdings of trustees in a trust of which an employee is a member. The connection may well be remote. It seems sensible to move in the direction that the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have two questions to which I am sure that the Government will give us satisfactory answers. First, why is the figure 25 per cent? I appreciate that it has been at that level for some time. That is not necessarily a reason for keeping it there.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
The Paymaster General said that the idea was that an employee should not have a substantial holding of the shares in a company. Is 24 per cent. not a substantial holding? The question of where the line should be drawn is endlessly debatable, but it would be useful to hear about the Government's thinking on the choice of one quarter as the test for material interest. It seems fairly high and it might be sensible, perhaps as a quid pro quo for the more generous changes that the Government are making elsewhere, to consider reducing the 25 per cent. threshold. Are the Government absolutely certain that no trust could be deliberately established specifically for the purpose of avoiding the material interest rule? I hope that the answer will be that no trust could be established in such circumstances to avoid the test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to raise one or two relatively minor points. Paragraph 3 provides that a personal representative of a deceased employer can elect to continue to run a scheme. That seems to be sensible, but I have two questions about it. First, is there a mechanism for the employees involved in a scheme in such circumstances to request such a continuation, or is it simply the decision of the employer's representative? Clearly, the employees may have a real interest in the scheme's continuation. Secondly, is a time limit being placed on the decision, or will it be open-ended? Will the representative of the deceased employer need to establish a new scheme after a year or so, or can he simply continue the old one?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, paragraph 14(3)(ff) seems to give discretion as to whether national insurance contributions on PRP payments are deducted in computing profits. Why are the Government making that change? I see no reason for doing so, because the national insurance system operates on all employers. I see no reason for excluding that calculation in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should welcome the Government's response to those detailed questions. However, our principal concern is that the 5 per cent. rule is to be removed. I suspect that the Government are going ahead with that in an attempt to stoke up interest in a scheme for which a disappointing number of people have applied, which was launched with great rhetoric three years ago. The removal of that threshold is a mistake, as it changes the whole purpose for which PRP was started in 1986 and 1987. It opens the way to tax-free bonuses being made available by employers on a random basis. It is not a sensible step for the Government to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) asked several questions during a long series of observations about schedule 4. I shall not go over the narrative that we have been over before, not least in Committee when the legislation was introduced, except to say that while it is reasonable for the hon. Gentleman to go over the ground that the Chancellor traversed when explaining why we were going to pursue this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
legislation, to describe the Chancellor's observations as confident expectations about its outcome is going further than the language will stand. The hon. Gentleman acknowledges that there was some conditionality to the Chancellor's remarks. We did not really know what would emerge as a result of this measure, but we were confident that what emerged would be good and worth while and that there were good grounds for introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three main benefits that accrue from the provision are: first, the incentive effect of linking pay to business performance; secondly, the fact that profit-related pay gives employees a greater awareness of how their company is doing and of the economic realities that it faces; and thirdly, it makes pay more flexible so that there is less need to lay off staff if profits decline. Those factors are clearly beneficial to employment in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made great play of the removal of the 5 per cent. rule, but we were practicing an alleviating measure in order to make it possible for those who found the 5 per cent. rule a major stumbling block to starting a scheme to enter PRP without it. We removed it on the basis of 18 months' experience of the existing arrangements, which had resulted in a figure of 7 per cent. rather than 5 per cent. in terms of actual performance. That 7 per cent. figure has been repeated in every quarter since March 1988, so the practice of those taking part was well above the 5 per cent. threshold. However, a number of companies in touch with us during the 18 months said that the existence of the threshold constituted a major stumbling block for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In order to assist companies wishing to start up a scheme but finding the initial threshold a stumbling block, might not some stepping mechanism be a more sensible way of proceeding than the complete removal of the threshold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rehearse all the arguments about the removal of the 5 per cent. rule because I have adduced the principal one. The one-man conduct of the Committee stage of the Second Finance Bill in 1987 by the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) was a remarkable achievement. We went through about 100 clauses, many of them on the Floor of the House, and none of his hon. Friends assisted him in any way in his conduct of the debate. It was a remarkable virtuoso performance by the hon. Gentleman. He alluded, as did some of my hon. Friends, to the degree of complexity in the legislation that we had originally introduced. It was a complaint that was made by a number of people outside the House. There was complexity in the legislation, for the very good reason that we wished to confer the maximum flexibility on those who were pursuing the schemes. The stepping-in mechanism that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury proposes would, I say diffidently, reintroduce further complexity when we, by the measure that we have taken, are seeking to reduce it. There is no compulsion on an employer and employee to continue a scheme once begun, and the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
purpose of the change that we have made is to introduce companies and employees to the idea of PRP, with the idea that they would explore it thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to the central units and to the fact that the legislation provides the opportunity for those units to which it would be impossible to ascribe a specific and local profit and loss account to participate by virtue of the global accounts of their organisations, subject to very strict rules governing the number of people who can participate. I say to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, on a day when his right hon. Friends have been drawing attention to research and development in British industry, that a company's research and development facility, which plays a central part in future profitability, is just such a unit for which a company might wish to establish PRP. Again, our actions regarding central units are in response to widespread representations, subject to the controls that we have set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury sought to suggest that the take-up of PRP had been disappointing. The interest taken in PRP on a continuing basis by a whole host of companies which have not yet adopted it is maintained. Nine thousand five hundred companies are consistently on the list of those who have asked the PRP office in the Inland Revenue to keep them informed of developments in PRP. In March 1989, that list increased by 300 companies, which is a demonstration of continuing interest and growth. For a new initiative, its growth has been very satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was on the Finance Bill Committee in 1978, but his party played a part in the introduction of employee share schemes. I am a veteran of that Committee, and I remember the party of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury introducing those proposals. The growth of PRP in the past 18 months compares favourably with the early growth of the share schemes introduced in 1978. When the Labour Government left office in spring 1979, only about 30 schemes had been approved by the Inland Revenue. In the full 18-month period after the introduction of the 1978 and the 1980 schemes, there were fewer than 200 employee share schemes, compared with the 850 launched for PRP at a similar stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury asked about the 25 per cent. rule for material interest. The answer lay in my original speech, but I am happy to tell him again. We have benefited enormously from the far-sighted statesmanship of our predecessors in Government who introduced the 1978 scheme and identified 25 per cent. as the appropriate figure. I hoped that the hon. Gentleman would have regarded imitation as a form of flattery in pursuing that rule, which has worked well over the years. If the hon. Gentleman is suddenly having doubts about it 11 years later, perhaps he will share them with the rest of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the possibility of a trust deliberately being set up to get round the provisions, there are some risks
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
in the easement proposed. However, the prescribed conditions provide safeguards against the likeliest forms of abuse. I believe that the increased risk is outweighed by the advantages of enabling companies with wide-ranging employee benefit trusts to introduce and operate PRP or employee share schemes to the general benefit of their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman for Islington, South and Finsbury asked about having a mechanism for employees. I am certain that employees will be able to say in an informal way whether they wish to have such a scheme. To the best of my knowledge—I shall inform the hon. Gentleman if I am wrong—the continuation of the old scheme inherited from the deceased employer is a feasible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed to allow employers, if they so wish, to exclude their own liability to national insurance contributions on PRP payments from the calculation of profits on which PRP is based. That does not affect an employer's liability to pay NIC on PRP payments, but it will solve the problem of mutual deductibility. The amount of PRP must be known before national insurance contributions can be worked out. National insurance contributions must also be known before PRP can be calculated, so there is a rational reason for its introduction. I hope that my answer satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General has satisfied me on one or two points, but not on all. I accept his explanation of mutual deductibility in relation to national insurance contributions. I also accept his point that the inclusion of members of staff in the research and development section of a company is a sensible exercise in relation to PRP schemes. However, there appears to be a clearer relationship between the generation of profit and work in an R and D establishment than between the generation of profit and work within the purely administrative headquarters of a company. We might have to say that to assist the one, the other should be included; but I accept at least part of the Paymaster General's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General let slip something that he might regret. He spoke in adulatory terms of the foresighted statesmanship of the Labour Government of the 1970s. Coming from the chairman of the Conservative party, that is praise to be savoured and treasured. The next time that the Prime Minister says at the Prime Minister's Questions how dreadful the Labour Government were from 1974–79, we shall be able to quote the words of the chairman of her party. We welcome the right hon. Gentleman's words and shall remember them for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's justification for the removal of the 5 per cent. threshold rule rests on two principles. One argument is about the difficulty of starting up; the other is about complexity. As I said earlier, the first argument could be tackled easily if a stepping mechanism were introduced. It would not necessarily be complex; it would be easy to introduce; and it would solve the problems of start-up and be a more sensible route for the Government to follow. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
Paymaster General's argument against that course does not hold up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about complexity is interesting and I am pleased that the Paymaster General gave a bouquet to my extremely valued and excellent hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), although he forgot to include in his praise his right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who gave a mighty performance on the Floor of the House. Long sittings on that Finance (No. 2) Bill owed much to those two hon. Members. Removing complexity is a worthwhile motive, but not if it means abandoning the scheme's basic principles, and that is precisely what the Government are doing in removing the 5 per cent. rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis on which profit-related pay was introduced in 1986 and 1987 was that, to qualify for tax relief, it would be an integral part of an employee's pay. If the 5 per cent. rule is removed and a 1 or 2 per cent. addition to pay is allowed on a profit-related basis, the basic principle of the need for PRP to be integral within an employee's earnings will be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making the change, the Government are resiling from that principle. It makes nonsense of the claims that the Government made in 1986. The scheme will be open to substantial abuse by employers, who will use PRP as a top-up mechanism rather than as a fundamental element of flexibility and incentive in an employee's pay. I suspect that the Opposition will be proved right on that. It gives me no pleasure to say that, but the Government are wrong to make the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am satisfied with the answers given on some points raised in this brief debate, because the Government are not giving way on that central issue on PRP—unless there is an 11th-hour conversion—I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be the first to admit that he has been mildly provocative in one or two of his remarks. It is a great mistake to generalise from the particular. Because I was generous in my remarks about some aspects of the Finance Bill in 1978, that does not extend to the whole Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an Opposition habit to forget legislation that they introduce. In 1987 I had difficulty with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) over a provision on which he became apocalyptic about Inland Revenue actions. It than transpired that similar provisions had been made in the 1978 Finance Bill to which I alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was a little churlish about central units. A host of people in company headquarters, including those in corporate planning and marketing, play a significant part in the present and future profitability of businesses. It seems to be a sign of the changing tide in the Labour party that administrators were dismissed with the word "mere". That was contrary to certain attitudes that the Labour party has adopted towards administrators in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
The hon. Gentleman made a remark about the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. He was right to allude to the Government side of the Bill. The Government went into the Bill with three bowlers. Perhaps my right hon. Friend and I were J. J. Warr and Alec Bedser—to return to that famous occasion when England went into a test match with only three bowlers. Under the laws of cricket, I do not know how the hon. Member for Sedgefield managed to maintain the bowling at one end throughout the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 45, line 40, after "associates", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"excluding for this purpose any trustees of any employee benefit trust,".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Government's original intention is fulfilled. That intention was to remove what has proved to be a significant technical barrier to the receipt of tax relief by employees and employee share schemes and, therefore, to the setting up of such schemes. We fear that the clause may not be worded as precisely as it needs to be, because there is some confusion between associated and trustees, and about when associates are also trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
The problem was that the rules governing material interests prevented many people without a real material interest from receiving tax relief, because the trustees of the scheme, who would usually be owners or directors of the company, were considered to be associates of any employee who might benefit from the trust, even though they did not so benefit. If the shares are held by a trust set up for the benefit of employees, each employee is regarded as being interested in all the shares held by the trust. The Chancellor was right to try to sort out that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in drafting the modification in the Bill, the Government have not gone the whole way. The exclusion seeks to ensure that when an employee has a significant material interest in the company together with his or her associates who are not trustees, the trustees of the employee benefit trust are again considered to be associates of that employee and the tax relief is not available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line 40 of clause 62 the Government have omitted to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"excluding for this purpose any trustees of any benefit trust".</p></blockquote>
Without those words the clause is internally inconsistent, because new subparagraph (1) says that trustees shall not be regarded as associates, but new subparagraph (3) uses the word "associates" in a way which includes associates who are trustees. The Inland Revenue press release refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"an employee together with his or her associates (other than the trustees)".</p></blockquote>
That is not clear in the clause—hence the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue raised by the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) is similar and analogous to the point that we discussed in the previous debate. I am advised that the hon. Gentleman's proposal is unnecessary, but I shall study his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment seems to be to ensure that the trustees of a defined employee benefit trust are not an employee's associates for the purposes of the test contained in new paragraph 40(3) on an employee's interest in the employing company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New paragraph 40 provides that such trustees are not an employee's associates for the purposes of that test simply because the employee has an interest in the trust. Schedule 5 of the Bill provides that paragraph 7(12) of schedule 8 of The Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies to new paragraph 40. I am advised that for that reason the amendment is unecessary
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes too far, beyond what even the hon. Gentleman had in mind, because it would mean that the trustees of an employee benefit trust, on which an employee or any of his relatives had settled shares, would not be treated as associates of the employee for the purpose of the test. That goes further than we wish, since it would mean that members of, for example, a small family company, could participate in an employee share scheme by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
settling their shares on a trust and at the same time continue to control the company. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not have that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substantial relaxation that we propose in the Bill in the material interest tests in approved employee share schemes has inevitably necessitated complex provisions to ensure that the basic purpose of those tests was not undermined. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. I hope that he will accept my assurance that the matter is covered. I shall study his remarks carefully in case I have omitted any point and if necessary I shall come back to him, but I hope that he will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no difference of purpose between the Minister and me on this question. I would be satisfied by an undertaking that he and his advisors will consider the matter carefully, if we could be sure that trusts designed to benefit employees will not be deprived of tax relief for reasons that the Government themselves do not want. It is the complication of considering clause 62(41) along with subsections (43)(a) and (b) which leaves me a little anxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter can be studied by those whose knowledge of such issues is much more intimate than mine. If, at a later stage, the Minister can tell me that he is fully satisfied that the amendment is unnecessary, I shall be very grateful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles of this provision and the provisions of clause 45, which we shall shortly debate, have been trawled through during our discussion on schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no quarrel with the principle that the Government seek to establish by this clause and clause 45. It will ensure that a material interest is not seen as being participation in a trust at a remote remove. Earlier, I stated our fears. We do not want it to be possible for an individual deliberately to establish a trust in order to avoid the provisions of the material interest test. The Paymaster General gave a reasonable assurance on that, and I trust that the Financial Secretary will give us a similar assurance on this clause and on clause 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was because of our fears that we did not wish to go along the route that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) took in his amendment. It is obviously open to abuse. The possibility of avoidance as a result of the Government's new proposals worries us, and I hope that the Government can assure us that if, in a year or two, it becomes obvious that the new procedures are being misused in the way that we fear, they will return to the matter in a future Finance Bill. In the meantime, the principle seems sensible. We hope that the Government have safeguarded it properly and that they can reassure us that they have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). As he said, the substance of the clause has already been debated in connection with clause 58 and schedule 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees or directors who have a material interest in their company cannot participate in approved employee share schemes. For all-employee share schemes, this means an interest in more than 25 per cent. of the ordinary shares of the company, and for discretionary share option schemes it means an interest in more than 10 per cent. The hon. Gentleman knows that it is not always 25 per cent. The figure varies in different cases, and I do not know whether all originated under the Labour Government. For close company loans, there is yet another figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For obvious reasons, the legislation requires that, in addition to the individual's own shares, those of his associates have to be reckoned with in deciding whether he has a material interest. As the law stands, if the employee has an interest in a trust which holds some of the company's ordinary shares, then the trustees are his associates and their shareholding has to be added to his in deciding whether he has a material interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who served on the Committee discussing previous Finance Bills may remember that this point has been raised in connection with employee share schemes over the years. We introduced the changes to material interest because that point was raised in the past. It has been claimed that it is an inhibiting factor in the promotion of different types of employee share schemes and in profit sharing. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury dwelt on the risks of abuse. I told the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed that we have built into all these sections a number of anti-abuse provisions, and I rejected his previous amendment because it went too far. Obviously, some risks are involved, but we have made provision to counter them as far as possible. The risks are small and are outweighed by the desirability of encouraging employee share schemes. The changes are designed to do that and are a response to pressure from companies who felt that there was an inhibition in the development of employee share schemes. That is why we have brought forward these changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the different provision of savings-related share option schemes. I have one major question. The provisions of clause 59(3) make a fairly substantial change in the maximum discount that is permitted on the share price at which options may be granted under savings-related schemes. The present restriction is for a 10 per cent. discount on the new price. This provision doubles that to a 20 per cent. discount—to an 80 per cent. rather than a 90 per cent. price. That is a substantial increase in discount. The Government appear to be being extremely generous, and we are entitled to ask why. The change does not appear to be particularly justified and it would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could explain what has led the Government to bring the change forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause increases the tax relief available to employees participating in improved all-employee savings related share option schemes by doing two things. First, it raises the monthly limit on savings contribution, and secondly, it increases the statutory limit on the share price discount at which options may be offered to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since their introduction in the Finance Act 1980, the all-employee savings related share option schemes have been popular and successful. More than 800 schemes have now been approved and options have been granted to employees on shares with an initial market value of over £3 billion. In 1987–88 alone, more than 400,000 employees were granted options on shares worth nearly £900 million. I am sure that all my hon. Friends will agree that that is welcome progress and is part of the Government's commitment to wider share ownership and, in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
particular, to encouraging people to hold a stake in the companies for which they work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first change is the increase from £100 to £150. That was last increased in 1984 and an increase now in line with the rise in average earnings since then would point to a figure of about £130. We think that it is right to go somewhat further than that and to enable companies to give their employees the opportunity to save at a higher level if they want to. The effect will be to increase the size of the share options which may be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change, on which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury concentrated, increases the statutory limit on the discount at which options may be offered. Since these schemes were first introduced, employers have been able to fix the price of the shares which may be obtained when the options are exercised after five years at a discount of up to 10 per cent. of the value of the share at the time of the option grant. We decided to double it to 20 per cent. simply to make share option schemes more attractive on an all-employee basis. We believe that that is a worth while objective. We want it to happen; we want a higher take-up; we want more of these schemes. That is the simple reason why we have done this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the right hon. Gentleman's estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of making the concession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a figure to hand, but I guess that the cost will be minimal. If I have a more reliable figure later, I shall certainly give it to the hon. Gentleman but I do not believe that it will be significant. The higher discount level is to apply from Royal Assent, and the increased savings limit from a date to be fixed by order. We believe that these schemes have proved highly successful and we want to encourage them further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary says that the increase from £100 to £150 is related to a figure higher than the rise in average earnings. The Government use the rise in average earnings whenever they wish to pluck a larger figure out of the air than they would if they used the rise in the retail price index. It is a pity that they do not apply the same logic to the level of the old-age pension.

The doubling of the allowable discount on share option schemes to increase take-up should give us pause for thought. We do not feel sufficiently strongly to want to divide the Committee, but nonetheless we should flag up a little concern at how the Government are being generous in that respect and mean in others. We should also like to express our concern about the absence of a readily available costing figure. If the Financial Secretary is right and the Government want substantially to increase the take-up of such schemes, there must be a consequent cost to the Exchequer—the higher the take-up, the higher the cost. Therefore, we are a little surprised that no immediate cost could be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the apparent lack of even-handedness in the Government's generosity. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
clause appears to provide a substantial, targeted increase in only one respect. However, we do not wish to express dissatisfaction with the principle of all-employee share option schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill increases the limits in all the different schemes that the Government have to encourage the development of employee share ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause raises the limit on the value of shares that can be appropriated to employees participating in approved all-employee profit-sharing schemes. In 1979 there were 30 such schemes. Now, nearly 800 have been approved. The last year for which figures are available was 1987–88 and was, in many ways, the most successful yet. Over 100 new schemes were approved, and some 600,000 employees were allocated shares with an initial make value of some £450 on average for each. The total was some £270 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made a number of improvements to this legislation over the years, aimed at increasing take-up, while at the same time reinforcing the main thrust of the legislation, which is that these tax-relieved schemes should be genuinely open to employees at all levels of the company, on similar terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual limit on the value of shares that can be given tax-free to employees was last increased in 1983, and we think that it is now time to increase it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause increases the limit from £1,250 to £2,000. However, the new limit also retains the alternative of 10 per cent. of the employee's earnings, which was introduced in 1983 to make the schemes more flexible and attractive for companies. It is important to retain that flexibility. However, by limiting the maximum appropriation to £6,000—an increase from the present £5,000—we have concentrated the increase at the lower end of the scale, rather than increasing both limits by the same proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers will retain the flexibility of measuring share appropriation to individual employees in terms of pay and length of service, within the confines of the similar terms provision and, naturally, we hope that they will take full advantage of the scope to appropriate more free shares to employees.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small point, but I should welcome the Financial Secretary's guidance on it. It seems to me that the import of the clause is that it will no longer be necessary for a consortium company to hold 15 per cent. of the ordinary share capital of a company for that company to be able to use the consortium members' own shares in connection with an approved share option or profit sharing scheme. Does that mean that the consortium company need have effectively no connection with the company in question? The removal of the 15 per cent. rule would seem to suggest precisely that. It would be useful to have some guidance from the Financial Secretary on how the Government believe that the provision will work in practice. Will the complete disconnection that seems to be possible as a result of the clause harm the outcome that the Government intend in introducing the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a company is owned by a consortium, this clause will make it easier for it to use the shares of a member of the consortium in an approved employee share scheme. At present, for the consortium member's shares to be used in this way, it must have a holding of 15 per cent. This clause reduced that requirement to 5 per cent. That is the connection that it must have with the company. The purpose of this requirement is, of course, to ensure that there is a direct link between the company for which an employee participant in a scheme works and any company whose shares are used in the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there have not been widespread difficulties, we have come to the conclusion that there is no reason why the present requirement should not be relaxed. A 5 per cent. test in relation to consortia is already used elsewhere in tax legislation, and in this respect it will allow more flexibility in the shares that can be used by companies wishing to operate approved schemes. Therefore, we decided to take the opportunity of the Finance Bill, which includes a number of improvements to the employee share scheme provisions, to act on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure retains the connection, but the connection is diminished from 15 per cent. to 5 per cent. Even if a consortium company is structured in such a way that the share is 5 per cent., we see no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
reason why it should not be able to participate in an employee share scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that confirmation. It is important that there is a connection between the consortium and the company in order for the provisions to come into effect. The fact, which is not easily identifiable from the Bill, that the 5 per cent. rule will still apply is confirmation of that. I am grateful for that, and am happy to support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although I have some points of detail on schedule 5 that I wish to raise, I think that it would be convenient for the Committee to debate the points of principle in the range of clauses before us.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 63 stands under a different heading from the others. I have issued a provisional selection, but in view of the Minister's comments, it might be sensible to dispose of clause 63 and allow a general, wide-ranging debate on clause 64. I should then be fairly rigorous about ensuring that members of the Committee stick to specific points thereafter. So we shall debate clause 63 separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 63 goes with a battery of improvements in measures to encourage employee share ownership. It makes improvements to the tax relief that we introduced last year, which were designed to ensure that normally no income will be due on the benefit that an employee can obtain when he is given priority in the allotment of shares in a public offer of shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
In the interests of promoting employee share ownership, last year we provided that where employees acquire shares in a public offer at the same price as members of the public, and a benefit arises solely because they receive more shares than members of the public, there is no charge to income tax on that priority benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain conditions were imposed last year. The exemption applies only to genuine offers to the public. To ensure that, there is a limit of 10 per cent. on the number of shares in the public offer that may be allocated in priority to employees. All the directors and employees who have priority must have it on similar terms. Priority must not be confined wholly or mainly to directors or to those whose remuneration exceeds a particular level. I think that I carry the Committee with me on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two changes that we propose in this clause consist essentially of technical improvements to ensure that the relief is available in certain circumstances. In no case will the changes reduce the amount of relief that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first change deals with what happens when employees are entitled to shares that carry both priority and discount rights. At present, priority and discount benefits are taxable as the exemption applies only where employees and the public pay the same price. We propose that the priority benefit in such cases should be exempted, provided that the necessary conditions are met. The discount gain—the difference between the price paid by the public and that paid by the employees—will remain taxable in relation to all the shares that the employee receives with the benefit of the discount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change deals with cases where an offer to the public consists of a number of different elements, for example, when a fixed price offer is combined with a tender offer. Under the present rules, if employees are entitled to priority in only one element, the total number of shares that can be allocated to them under employee priority may well fall considerably below 10 per cent. of the total of the ordinary shares subject to the whole offer. That is because the limit for the shares allowed to be preferentially allocated to employees applies separately to each separate element of the total offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change establishes a revised limit for the separate elements. The limit for each element is to be increased to 40 per cent. of the shares on offer under that part of the offer. The 40 per cent. applies only to a share offer that consists of different elements, such as a fixed price and a tender element. I stress that, for the offer as a whole, the limit will remain at 10 per cent. of the total of the ordinary shares in the whole offer. Priority shares cannot be given away at a discount to get the tax advantage if it exceeds 10 per cent. of the whole offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new 40 per cent. limit, which applies to part of the offer, will give companies greater scope to give employees priority rights in more sophisticated public offers. At the same time, maintenance of the overall limit of 10 per cent. will ensure that the employee priority shares that can qualify for tax relief remain subject to a reasonable limit so that the tax
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
exemption will apply only for genuine offers of shares to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause represents a small but worthwhile improvement to the existing exemption. It is a complex, narrow point, but we want to ensure that employees will not be disadvantaged if priority offers are available to them. The clause enlarges the circumstances in which employees will not suffer income tax on the benefit that they derive from priority in a genuine offer of shares to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says, it is a narrow point but the Committee would be interested to learn the take-up of employee priority shares, with or without discount rights.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman figures.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to oblige you, Mr. Cormack, and to oblige the Committee. We are coming to a new part of the Bill that deals with employee share ownership plans, so it is a little difficult to explain the amendments without explaining what we are doing in clause 64. Nevertheless, so that we can have a debate on the principles in clause 64, I shall assume that all members of the Committee know what clause

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>283</span>
64 does. I shall start by saying what is wrong with the clause and why it is necessary to amend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 186 is a small, technical amendment, which makes clear what sort of payments are to qualify for the new tax relief that we shall discuss for company contributions to ESOP trusts. The Bill merely refers to a payment by a company to the trustees, but that is a wide term and may be taken to include a loan or a payment of dividend. The amendment makes it clear that the relief applies only to a payment which is a contribution by the company to the trust, made for no consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 188.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two amendments extend the ambit of the new corporation tax relief for company contributions to ESOPs in a small but important respect. As the Bill stands, a company can get relief only if some of its own employees are eligible to benefit under the ESOP which receives the contribution. On reflection, it seems that we can go further and that an ESOP should benefit not only the employees of the company that sets it up but also those of any of its subsidiaries. If we left the Bill as it stands, it would unnecessarily restrict the sort of company that could enjoy the new tax relief to one that at the time had employees who were beneficiaries of the trust. That inflexibility is unnecessary in groups. The amendment will therefore make the relief also available when, although the contributing company itself may have no eligible employees at the time of the contribution, it has a subsidiary—or subsidiaries—that have. For example, the parent company may be a holding company with no employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall discuss subsidiaries elsewhere, but in general we want ESOPs to apply throughout a group. However, if a parent company has no employees, it would seem strange in such fortuitous circumstances the tax relief should not apply to contributions to a trust of a subsidiary. This widening of the relief will provide greater flexibility to groups of companies that want to contribute to ESOPs. Furthermore, a holding company in a group, which may have no eligible employees of its own, will not be precluded from contributing to an ESOP for the group as a whole. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we welcome the Minister's comments, but is he saying that the change now being made will apply only to qualifying

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it applies only to ESOP trusts that obtain tax relief under the conditions laid down by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am not a technician in this area of the Bill, although I am interested in its general provision. What happens if an employee works for one subsidiary and then transfers to another within the group, or if one particular company is regrouped into another company or changes its form, which may well happen in a trust? Will it still be possible within that basic structure for contributions to continue in an untroubled way into the ESOP and for the employee to experience no material difference or difficulty in maintaining his contribution record?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each company in the group would probably have its own ESOP. There is no transferability of ESOP rights from one company to another within a group. If a person had worked for a company for long enough and the ESOP has been established for long enough, he might acquire a capital sum and be able to move and benefit from another ESOP within the group, but one does not move from one ESOP to another. If there are separate ESOPs in separate subsidiaries, one would have to leave one and move to another. It might be possible to set up an ESOP that covered a group of companies, but that would be a different matter, structured in a different way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I regret the absence of my hon. Friends the Members for Esher (Mr. Taylor) and for Wyre (Mr. Mans) even more than usual. Amendment No. 223 is a probing amendment—at least, in my hands it is. It relates to a problem that might arise at the beginning of an ESOP, if it is set up at the same time as a company. Without the amendment, in some circumstances it may be impossible to say, for the purposes of clause 64, that any employees are eligible to benefit under the terms of the deed. Clause 64 might not apply, although it was intended that it should. The amendment seeks to put that right, but I do not know whether it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
somewhere between London airport and the House—cannot move his amendment himself, because he has taken a great interest in ESOPs. He has written an excellent pamphlet on the subject and has done much to stimulate my interest. Some clauses have been introduced partly due to his efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of my hon. Friend's amendment is to ensure that an ESOP may be used at the time of a buy-out involving the creation of a new company set up to run the business by the buy-out team. The ESOP provisions in the Bill require beneficiaries of ESOP trusts to have completed at least one year's service, so employees of a new company cannot be beneficiaries for the first year. That means that a new company's contribution to the ESOP trust in its first year of business cannot qualify for relief from corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, nothing prevents an ESOP trust being set up at the outset by the new company and for the trust to purchase shares using borrowed funds. The trust would identify as beneficiaries employees with one year's service. At the end of the first year, such employees would become beneficiaries. They would be eligible to receive distributions from the trust, and their existence would qualify company payments to the trust for corporation tax relief. Since it is usual for ESOP trusts to be funded by such borrowings, I do not think that the in-built one year delay on company contributions to the trust will be a formidable—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Esher to the Committee, but he has missed his amendment already. We are delighted to see him and to hear his views. For his benefit, I shall repeat that the Bill as structured could result in a delay of a year before qualifying for tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline the fact that this delay will apply only to ESOPs involving new companies which are formed, for instance, for purposes of a buy-out. Even then a problem may arise only if the new company wants to make contributions to the trust in its first year. In the more conventional buy-out, where a new company is not involved, the company concerned will in all probability have eligible employee beneficiaries of the ESOP trust already. So company contributions could qualify for relief from the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the problem that my hon. Friend has identified. I share his concern, but I do not accept the amendment for the reasons that I have given. I have correctly stated the position, but I shall keep it under review. It is not overridingly important to deal with the situation of the new company because the delay involved in obtaining the tax relief will be limited. But this is new territory: we have introduced this relief for the first time. We want ESOPs to get off to a good start. If this matter becomes a problem we will consider whether action needs to be taken. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford for stepping into the breach and moving the amendment and to my hon. Friend for Esher for having tabled it in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
when I walked in the Room. The reason for my delay should be taken up with the Secretary of State for Transport and need not detain the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and deals with the difficulty of companies that are either starting up or reorganising on a buy-out. The Financial Secretary has alluded to some of the difficulties, but I stress that as many firms as possible should be encouraged to adopt employee share ownership. Therefore, the circumstances in which an employee share ownership trust can be set up should be as flexible as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With corporate finance techniques, I envisage that a new company might wish to have an ESOP from day one. However, there are doubts as to whether that is possible because of the way in which the Bill is drafted. There is a one-year delay, but that leads to artificiality and the possibility of manufacturing employees in order to serve as trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary will consider the amendment because those of us who wish to see employee share ownership expand aim to ensure that no artificial barriers are put in its place. One of the major areas of expansion is start-ups and management buy-outs and I hope that the Financial Secretary will keep that sector in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I had hoped that we could have debated the principles of the proposals on the Floor of the House, but that was not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party is solidly in favour of employee share ownership plans. We specifically referred to them in the report of the Policy Review Group on the Productive and Competitive Economy and we referred to them with enthusiasm. The structure could lead to genuine worker control and positive and constructive participation in management decision-making. I strongly support that, and it is also supported by the Unity Trust bank which has been financing ESOP schemes since 1985. About a dozen are now successfully under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the structure, as it is set out in the Bill, as a glorified profit-sharing scheme—nor is it a vehicle for employees just to have a minority share option with which they should be content. If the proposals were a management device to increase

productivity by giving workers a stake in the company, Labour Members would be much more lukewarm about them. Of course, there is more to it than that. The link between the worker having a minority share-holding and any consequent incentive is so remote that the idea that an employee will work harder does not stand up to close examination. The benefit to the employee is too small to provide a real incentive.

The American evidence, such as it is, does not contradict that view. I should be interested to hear what conclusions Conservative Members who have considered that evidence have drawn from it. I believe that at best it is ambiguous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, the practical application of ESOPs is in the area of management buy-outs. All existing examples are management or management-worker buy-outs of enterprises. There is no reason why the ESOP model, once more firmly established, should not have a wider application when, for example a retiring owner-manager of a family business transfers ownership to the employees. In those circumstances, the ESOP structure could be particularly attractive and would have the enormous advantage of providing effective protection against asset-stripping and the consequent loss of jobs that often comes from takeover bids.

A great strength of the ESOP structure is that it protects workers' rights rather than turning workers into mini-capitalists. That is the attraction for many employees. They do not consider the structure as a vehicle for making profits from shares, but view it as a mechanism to have control over the company, and they gain their incentives through regulating their pay and conditions in line with market forces and exerting pressure on the overall money available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on from the principle to the matter of tax liability. Perhaps the most significant part of the proposals is the clarification of the present position, particularly on corporation tax. The proposals clarify the corporation tax position in such a way as to confirm what many of us thought already, but it is helpful to have it set out. I hope that the Minister can make clear the distinction between a qualifying employee share ownership trust and a non-qualifying trust in their relationships to corporation tax. I understand that non-qualifying employee share ownership trusts can also, in practice, get relief. If that is the case, that undermines part of the incentive to become a qualifying trust. That reservation underlay my earlier question to the Minister on the Government amendment. I hope that the Minister can clarify the position when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to two further issues in this general introduction to the topic—the role of the trade union movement and privatisation. Trade unionists have a dilemma in approaching the ESOP structure. They have a duty to represent employees and the interests of the employees vis-à-vis the management of the company. As their members are encouraged to enter into such an arrangement, they effectively become shareholders and so influence the company's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
management. Critics of ESOPs maintain that that dilemma undermines its effectiveness as an employment model, as investors lack confidence in it and workers find it impossible to bridge that dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unionists who are active participants in an ESOP scheme tell me that they thought carefully about that and decided that the two functions—the duty to represent the members who work for the institution and the duty to ensure that their investment is properly safeguarded—can be separated and are not incompatible. That is a constructive approach, which I strongly support. The trade union involved in the ESOP that I know in some detail, the TGWU, has given thorough consideration to that problem and has resolved it to its satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of its backers, the Unity Trust Bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The separation of those two viewpoints and the willingness of the employees to make the ESOP work are essential to the eventual chances of success of any such scheme. It is therefore unfortunate that the most active interest in ESOPs at present seems to be coming from those in the public sector who are having to face up to privatisation, particularly those in the public transport sector. The Secretary of State for Transport was perfectly properly blamed earlier for the late arrival of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor). He could also be blamed for the passage of the Transport Act 1983. That Act required public authorities to divest themselves of their public transport undertakings. Those were often very sophisticated operations that were in the public sector not just for political reasons, because the authorities concerned approved of public ownership, but for social and strategic planning reasons. The principle of integrated transport was held to bring great benefits to local communities. That was certainly the case on Tyneside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 75 of the Transport Act 1983 facilitates employee buy-outs of passenger transport undertakings when privatisation is forced through. The bodies that have to carry out the privatisation are in many cases Labour-controlled authorities, strongly committed to public transport and public ownership. On Tyneside the authority was strongly committed to an integrated passenger transport system, where the buses ran into the metro and rail network. All that has been broken up by deregulation, so the Labour-controlled authorities and the work force have had to square up to the unpleasant task of working out how to respond to the pressures from the Government to privatise the undertakings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It reflects great credit on the local authorities—the district councils that have ended up as the owners of those undertakings following the abolition of the metropolitan councils—that they have decided to put the interests of the work force and of the local communities before possibly their own best financial interests, because they would gain a capital receipt from the sale, and also before the interests of those who would come in and strip out the assets rather than maintain the services. The stark reality of privatisation is that enterprises that were previously publicly owned have been sold into the private sector

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
and purchased by a combination of their competitors and those who have made a short-term gain on stripping out their assets. Many of those undertakings are in valuable urban centre sites, which would perhaps be only a duplication for their competitors. Many of them have control of routes that their competitors would rather abolish to establish their own monopoly than allow to continue to flourish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, the work forces at Yorkshire Rider and at Busways on Tyneside decided to explore the possibilities of an ESOP. The workers at Busways became 49 per cent. owners of their own bus company last week. I wish them well. I hope that the adventure on which they have embarked is successful. There is an enormous amount of good will towards them in the community that I represent. We understand the alternatives, and why they decided to opt for ESOPs. By doing so, they have ensured that their employment and services will endure, and that an effective transport undertaking will remain in place so that a Labour Government will be able to re-establish plans for an integrated passenger transport network on Tyneside, south Yorkshire and elsewhere.

I agree with the Financial Secretary that we are entering new territory and that ESOPs should get off to a good start, and I am grateful for his commitment to review progress. If it emerges that some of the details of the regulatory clauses set out in the Bill are onerous, or do not work as well as we hope, I trust that we can re-examine these matters in future Finance Bills, as that would be the correct approach. I hope that this new, relatively unchartered area will get off to a good start and become a much more significant employment mechanism in our economy in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done my homework and have taken the trouble to re-read your speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise; I meant the hon. Gentleman's speech. The Labour party should see employee share ownership schemes as not necessarily meaning control. We are discussing not something that must be more than 51 per cent. to be acceptable, but a transfer of company capital to employees in that company. They will thus share the company's wealth and success as it progresses, which is a different concept from control of the company. That is not to say that there could be no circumstances in which more than 51 per cent. would pass to employees; such cases already exist, and I welcome them. Indeed, the noble Lord Onslow moved an amendment to the Companies Bill in another place, which assured a statutory designation for partnership companies, which implies more than 51 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give a general welcome to the Bill, and I repeat the tribute that I paid to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on Second Reading. This is a major and exciting piece of legislation. It represents the statutory recognition of a method of ensuring that employees have more than just their wages as an interest in the company for which they work. That is an essential part of spreading the capital-owning democracy.

As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) pointed out, it was possible before to set up employee share ownership plans, but the risk was that they were subject to case law—in other words, they were subject to challenge by the Inland Revenue. I believe that I am correct—my right hon. Friend will challenge me if I am not—in saying that the Inland Revenue had a remarkable list of failures in those companies, in the sense that employee share ownership plans had a certain amount of security under case law. However, when there is a balancing factor in whether or not to go ahead with such a scheme, the possibility of being challenged is a major deterrent. This legislation removes it, as long as the qualifying conditions are met by the employee share ownership trust. The measure is a great step forward and we warmly welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to clarify what the attitude of the Inland Revenue would be to employee share ownership schemes which were not specifically set up under the new terms. There are quite justifiable circumstances in which it might not be possible for companies to set up a scheme under those terms, and it would be of considerable concern to people in companies who were anxious to ensure that there was such a scheme, or to financial advisers, if the old employee share ownership plan was going to be challenged by the Inland Revenue more successfully in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
When such a measure is included in a Finance Bill, it is often at risk of being too encased in conditions. We introduce a marvellous new concept but then find so many conditions among the qualifying terms that if we are not careful we return to the Committee 12 months later and find that the rate of take-up by the commercial sector of a piece of legislation has not been so enthusiastic as we might have wished. That is the main point of my intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several areas, and my amendments have suggested some of them, in which the current qualifying terms are too restrictive—for example, the way in which the trustees are formulated. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, after consideration, might now consider that it is too detailed and that the organisation should be left more to the discretion of the people involved. The proposed system for the election of employee representatives is not necessarily advantageous, nor is it necessarily an advantage to have a majority of employee representatives, particularly in the early stages when much of the money may have to be provided by banks, rather than the companies, against a future pledge by the company to make tax deductible transfers to the employee trust. I urge my right hon. Friend to look closely at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also draw attention to the fact that, certainly from my readings of these clauses, it would be difficult to use unapproved or approved share option schemes—for example, under the Finance Act 1980 scheme or the Finance Act 1984 scheme. It is perfectly possible to say that those schemes should be run in parallel with an employee share ownership trust. However, that would be a disappointing precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances in which it would be advantageous for the option schemes to be run within the employee share ownership trust, still meeting the seven-year rule. That would allow greater flexibility for getting shares out of a company into the hands of employees more rapidly than by using the Finance Act 1978 scheme—the non-option scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an effort to ensure that more shares get into the hands of employees, I urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to clarify whether it is intended
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
that the 1980 and 1984 Finance Acts option schemes could be used in the context of an employee share ownership trust—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am aware that we are called to fulfil other duties. [Hon. Members: "We are not".] I am anticipating my possible rewards from this speech. I apologise for confusing the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Start-ups have already been discussed, and I hope that they will be considered further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary look closely at the burdens that he is placing on the trustees? It is often difficult to find trustees, and in this case a considerable number of employees should be trustees. A penal clawback under the tax penalties if some of the qualifying conditions are not met could fall on the trustees in certain circumstances. I do not have time to bore the committee with the details, but my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will understand my point. Trustees' liability should be carefully considered. We are not dealing only with professional people in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider issues, which we cannot ponder for too long, relate to capital gains tax and its effects. A year ago, I urged that there should be capital gains tax relief for vendors of shares to an employee share ownership trust if they reinvested the proceeds in quoted securities. That proposal is fiendishly difficult to draft. However, we want a level playing field, so as not to discourage family company owners from selling to an employee share ownership trust when the alternative may be to sell to a quoted company and receive the relief. On such narrow balances are decisions often made which I, as a self-declared enthusiast of employee share ownership, believe work against an important principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas there are question marks about CGT holdover relief as a result of other provisions in the Bill which, I confess, I have not fully mastered. I simply urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to look at them again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
