	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) for congratulating me on everything that I have said so far. I look forward to continued approbation from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three new clauses refer to unquoted companies and the inheritance tax regime facing them at present. I start by making it clear to my right hon. Friends that I know that the Government have done an enormous amount to mitigate the incidence of capital taxation on unquoted companies, among other particular groups. I do not wish any of my remarks—critical as they may be—to be taken as a representation that the Government have not been prepared to go some considerable way towards dealing with a real menace to the unquoted sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unquoted sector is an enormous tranche of economic life in this country. The Committee will be aware of the seminal work on the subject by the two Oxford economists, Hay and Morris. I am worried about the effects of capital taxation, especially on the unquoted, long-standing family company. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) mentioned those who wish unquoted companies to be taken to the unlisted market, or perhaps to a full listing on the stock exchange and so on. There are other unquoted companies which essentially will last only for the working lifetime of the proprietor and are not intended to have generational implications. But there are many unquoted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
companies that are long-standing family businesses. Some of the most famous names in business in this country are included among such companies. During the past decade, we have seen the creation of many small, unquoted businesses that will have a dramatic impact on our commercial fortunes for a long time to come. In my area, net VAT registrations from the Peterborough Customs and Excise office are up by more than 25 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another way of measuring that is the success of the enterprise allowance which for many small companies is little short of dramatic. In Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire the number of companies that have been awarded an enterprise allowance is accelerating at a dramatic speed. Of course, some of those companies will last no longer than the lifetime of the proprietor, while others may be quoted in due course, but for some, the motive is to ensure a family continuity of involvement in the business. As a country, we have an interest to ensure that that is allowed to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the second world war, the unquoted sector has been subject to three considerable sources of tax, which have removed from many parts of the country substantial long-term family businesses. I refer first to nationalisation. The takeover by the state of family companies in the north-east, the north-west, the midlands and in Scotland, and the removal of decision-making power from the shipyards, the steel industry and so on to London, has had a damaging effect on our economic life. No one should be in any doubt about the malign effect on long-term family businesses of nationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, roll-over relief for corporation tax has had an undesirable effect on family business, too. It has meant that quoted companies can take over unquoted companies and receive tax relief for so doing. The quoted sector is receiving a subsidy of the sort that I do not consider a desirable instrument of national policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must consider the significant impact on family businesses of capital taxation. For many unquoted companies and long-term family businesses, the charge against inheritance tax—estate duty as it was called in the old days—could be met only out of the active assets of the company. In other words, some or all of the company had to be sold—to the quoted sector, of course—with tax relief rolled over to meet the inheritance tax bill. That has meant that, throughout the country, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of substantial long-term family businesses. One way in which to remove that threat to the sector is to allow 100 per cent. relief against business property assets for inheritance tax. New clause 24 would achieve that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is aware of my argument as we have previously discussed the matter—we may have to do so again in the future. But what I have learnt during the few years that I have been a Member of Parliament and served on previous Finance Bill Standing Committees is that, just as we think that we have lost the argument, the Government give way. I do not expect my right hon. Friend to do that tonight,
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
but experience has taught us all that if we grind on about a matter, a concession is granted that makes all the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my right hon. Friend must not think that tonight's argument will be the last word on the subject—far from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as the menace that threatens the continuity of an important sector of our economy exists, it will be necessary for us to advance such arguments. I know that the Committee does not wish to have a long debate on the subject, but business relief is an important matter to unquoted long-term family businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 25 and 29 are incidental to the main argument, one would allow the same rate of taxation against majority and minority interests, and the other deals with how the potentially exempt transfer regime will be handled in the future under inheritance tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though the Government have gone quite a long way to help, they have not gone far enough. On the last occasion when we were given figures we were told that the cost of inheritance tax, if 100 per cent. business property relief were allowed against business assets in the industrial and commercial sector, would be £20 million, and if agriculture were allowed as well it would be £70 million. I shall be interested to hear what updated figures my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will give tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important argument which the Committee and my political party should take seriously and I urge it on my right hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government will resist the blandishments of the hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell). What would the proposal cost the Exchequer if it were implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) about the importance of the unquoted companies which so often become the large businesses of tomorrow. Indeed, some of the leading businesses of this country have been unquoted companies, and my hon. Friend was right to draw attention to the threat that taxation can pose to those businesses remaining within a family which provide continuity of both activity and employment. That is why, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, we have made significant changes in the capital tax regime which I believe will be warmly welcomed by the unquoted sector and have made an enormous difference to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with my hon. Friend's three new clauses. The first seeks to replace the current two tiers of business property relief with a single rate of 100 per cent., thus effectively exempting unquoted businesses from inheritance tax. My hon. Friend said that if we resisted that it might be an indication that we would like to give way. I am not sure in what language I can send my coded message to my hon. Friend, but I am not telling him that we are about to give way. We have never accepted that, merely because the property of an estate is held in the form of a business it should escape tax completely. The special rules of relief, with similar ones for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
agricultural property, recognise that a taxable estate which includes agriculture and business assets may not have the liquidity in which to pay the tax. That is why, as well as altering the absolute rate and making the changes for minority holdings, we have extended and made more generous the terms by which tax can be paid in instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Corby that when relief was first introduced under capital transfer tax it was limited to majority interests in unincorporated businesses. In 1978, that rate was increased from 30 to 50 per cent., and a new lower rate of 20 per cent. was introduced for minority shareholdings in unquoted companies. In 1983, this was raised to 30 per cent. since when the relief has continued to apply at two rates. The higher rate was extended to minority unquoted holdings of more than 25 per cent. in 1987. The lower rate of relief for small minority holdings in unquoted companies recognises that normally such a holding is worth considerably less than a controlling one and the minority shareholder is taking a lesser risk. Equally, assets held outside but used in a business are not as fully committed to, or as much at risk as, assets owned by the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have done an enormous amount since 1979 and that is not to mention what we did by replacing capital transfer tax with inheritance tax which, of course, is an amazing incentive to lifetime giving that encourages people to pass on a business to younger members of a family without an immediate charge to IHT. That has been welcomed by the Unquoted Companies Group and by business generally. Last year's change to the rate scale also means that even when IHT becomes payable on family businesses, the effective rate will not exceed 28 per cent.—even for a tiny holding in an unquoted company. For most family businesses, the effective rate will not exceed 20 per cent.—among the lowest in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our regime is generous. Of course, we review it, and, of course, we bear in mind the points highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Corby. He asked about the cost. The cost of 100 per cent. business property relief is estimated to be £20 million in a full year, a significant sum but not in itself an overwhelming argument. But the passing on of business assets should bear some tax, and both the structure of the tax and the arrangements that we have made for payment have lessened the liquidity problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 25 seeks to secure business property relief at 50 per cent. for all holdings, including minority holdings. We debated this subject last year, and an identical new clause was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) who said, modestly, that he thought that he had lost the intellectual argument. I see that he has passed the torch on to my hon. Friend the Member for Corby. It would be difficult to justify the new clause. Minority holdings differ, but at one extreme they may represent 2 or 3 per cent. holdings divided between 14 cousins. I am not clear what is the difference between such a holding and a passive
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
portfolio investment. If we are talking of a 24 per cent. holding, that is a different type of investment, but as we have to strike the balance it would be difficult at the lower end to justify extending the 50 per cent. relief to 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby called new clause 29 a technical provision. However, it is an interesting suggestion as he uses the seven-year provision to reshape inheritance tax, by making the seven years apply to the recipient of the assets, providing that he holds on to them. That would completely restructure inheritance tax, and would lead to a different form of tax. The present seven-year provision, with potentially exempt transfers, is necessary to protect the death charge in the tax as at present structured. We could not have a complete cut—off with no lead—as otherwise people would sign away their property on their death beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the completely different approach advocated by my hon. Friend. I shall not go into the detail, but I see a number of technical problems. It is not, for example, clear what will happen when the transferor dies within seven years of the transfer, for it is he who pays the tax. What would happen then, even if the transferee were still holding on to the share? My hon. Friend the Member for Corby has put forward an interesting, though radical, proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spelt out why I feel that my hon. Friend's main proposal, new clause 24, would be too generous, given the substantial changes that we have made in recent years. We are always reviewing these matters, and I shall bear in mind my hon. Friend's contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the way in which he has replied to the debate. He has been firm with the Committee, making it plain that where he says no, he means no. I do not doubt his bona fides. However, I have in previous years spent some time in the Finance Bill Committee arguing for the abolition of on-course betting duty relief for race courses, bashing my head against a brick wall, only to discover thay my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has now announced the introduction of what I had urged and which had been turned down so firmly by so many of my right hon Friend's predecessors. That gives us the hope that although it may not be possible to achieve the reforms tonight, they can be achieved in due course. For this year, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot promise to make a speech in inverse proportion to the somewhat inordinate length and portmanteau quality of the new clause, but I shall do my best to be brief. The debate should be read in context with last year's debate on aspects of forestry that arose out of the Government's major decision in last year's Finance Bill to revamp forest taxation. As the Financial Secretary recognised at the time, there were one or two aspects of unfinished business, which we invite him to consider further tonight, possibly on an interim basis and before reaching a final conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset I should like to make it clear that little purpose is served in seeking to overturn last year's events and to re-examine the philosophy of what is being done. I concede that it is too early to say how the system will shake down. I should record that at least in the short term there have been some dramatic consequences, but I concede that they may not continue to the same extent in the medium term. For example, we read of a significant reduction in the planting of conifers, with the suggestion that forest nurseries have had to destroy about 40 million surplus trees that they thought would have been planted. That is surprising in view of the transitional arrangements built into last year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to how we solve the problems—to which I shall refer in a moment—I have no fixed mind. The new clause is designed to elicit the Government's intentions, without a final blueprint, but I hope that we shall have identified the residual problems. The Financial Secretary will be aware that the chairman of the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain recently announced that in his view there is a need to reappraise some of the details, and bring forward some other proposals later this year. The Forestry Commission itself is reviewing its broadleaf policy before a final decision is taken, which is not an indefinite period. Although we need to consult and to get it right, we cannot wait for ever. I hope some firm decisions will be made in next year's Finance Bill. The estimate is for a £3 million annual cost. It is not a major revenue item, although equity needs to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is divided, like Gaul, into three parts. The first part deals with maintenance expenditure on woodlands, which we debated extensively last year and which I shall not rehash. Then it deals with certain matters of capital taxation that we withdrew last year and did not debate quite so fully, due to exigencies of time. The proposed section 41A is designed as a scaled-down limited relief for management expenses for woodlands. It is tailored to incorporate some of the safeguards that arose in what we all felt last year was a constructive debate. It is carefully structured so as not to apply to what might be called absentee forestry and, more generally,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
it is targeted towards what I might call traditional and environmentally-friendly forestry. My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) will recall being host at a most interesting forestry briefing day which a number of us, and many from outside the House, attended at Rockingham castle six weeks ago. We examined the problems of a traditional estate with broadleaf woodlands, with a high emphasis on conservation and a low emphasis on making huge profits from the woods, and considered how they should be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set down income tax relief as being extremely limited, applying only to woodlands that are not within the transition arrangements and only to expenditure on managing and maintaining woodlands—not at large—but confining it to indigenous woodlands. I have received, by correspondence, criticism of the rather limited nature of this proposal. Relief is to be given only to the extent that management or maintenance expenditure exceeds grants or incomes arising from the woodlands. It is to be given only against agricultural income and cannot be set off at large, and it is to be ring-fenced only onto agricultural income—or against agricultural income—arising on land contiguous, which deals with the absentee landlord point. These conditions are perceived to meet the objections that were raised last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for maintenance relief are, first, that it would allow the full integration of traditional woodlands with other activities conducted on the same estate. That is the reality of the situation—they have always been part of estate business. Secondly—I raise this point now rather than on the new clause that my right hon. Friends spoke to earlier—there is the question of agriculture buildings allowances and the sort of practical problems that remain for many estates and for many working farmers, especially in separating their forestry enterprise from their agricultural enterprise. The National Farmers Union has raised with me in correspondence the issue of whether certain bits of fencing—partly in promotion of a forestry activity or a farm woodlands scheme—would be easily divisible or treated one way or the other, as forestry investments or as farm investments. These matters will give rise to more problems than my right hon. Friends have credited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area of concern is dereliction, with special reference to the old woodlands that were severely depleted by the great storm of two years ago, where there is no help and little profit from sales until they can be sorted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, and finally, if we are to give maintenance help—I recall that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) was, on the whole, inclined to consider this in these circumstances—should it be given by grants, or by tax allowances? Personally, I would have had some sympathy for the concept, which my hon. Friends could have included in the previous Finance Bill, of treating the initial establishment of a plantation as a capital item and not allowing it to be offset against income tax, and then allowing the recurrent expenditure—and, by logic, the final proceeds—to be taxed. However, we did not go down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
I would not mind whether it was done by grant or tax allowance. Some of my correspondents felt that a tax allowance would be more certain. If it were done by grant, something along the lines of the old annual payments under the dedication scheme would be appropriate, because it would be possible for monitoring to take place on both the performance of maintenance and the environmental activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the substantial maintenance side, I come to capital, which is in two parts. The first is a proposal on capital gains tax, which is conceived simply to relieve the slightly quaint position in which, for the purposes of gains tax, the trees are not taxed but the land underneath them—the technical term is solum or prairie—is. Producing a separate valuation is a major administrative task, but the revenue is small. The provision paves the way for the more general points in proposed new subsection (4) of section 112 relating to inheritance tax, which we did not discuss last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an assumption, shared by Ministers, that forestry has been taken out of tax, but it has not been taken out of inheritance tax. The natural rotation of a broadleaved forest can extend to 100 or 120 years, during which it is likely to pass through the hands of three owners in succession. Inheritance tax is almost certain to bite and to make a serious inroad on plantations, especially of broadleaved trees. There will be only a small income from thinnings in the short term, but the heir is expected to pay for the apparent enthusiasm of his planter—a parent or donor—by meeting a tax bill long before the trees reach maturity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To meet the cost will be a recurrent problem. There is no support for maintenance on recurrent expenditure, but perhaps every 40 years there will be a significant capital liability. I wish to draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to a specific point. In some cases, which will be difficult to assess, where good forestry is practised and coupes—cutting areas—are taken in small areas recurrently, the final outcome will have to be calculated frequently, which will add to the amount of administration and to the number of times that tax must be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today has largely been one of consensus, which I am not anxious to breach. Many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee recognise that there are residual problems with the forestry proposals, which I believe that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary senses. I am not particularly doctrinaire about how the problems should be solved, but I am convinced that they are genuine. We have a common interest in promoting the environment and in the success of our woodlands, in particular our broadleaved, traditional woodlands. I hope that the Committee will tackle those issues in considering the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and I approach the new clause with the same ultimate objective—the promotion of good quality forestry. It is with that basic purpose that I approach his arguments and the detail of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
There are two principal issues in forestry that need to be tackled and that we should examine in studying the tax system and tax changes. The first is the difficulty faced by owners of existing woodlands, especially traditional, broadleaved woodlands, in maintaining and conserving their trees. We all wish to ensure that the financial regime encourages and assists environmentally sensitive conservation of good woodland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is the need to encourage small-scale planting, especially in lowland areas. A major advantage secured by the changes introduced last year is the move away from mass planting of marginal land on an obtrusive and injudicious scale. In return, we should encourage small-scale forestry to move down the hill into lower areas. It should not be on a mass scale, and in many cases, it should replace agricultural land that is no longer needed because of over-production. So those are two principal tasks that are involved in devising a financial regime for forestry: the need to secure good conservation-minded maintenance, and the need to encourage planting on a small scale in more lowland areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad principle that underlies the Opposition approach to the two problems that face forestry is that we would prefer not to use the tax system to encourage good forestry practice, but to use the grants mechanism. The reason is simple: the tax system has shown itself over the years, and especially over the past 10 years, to be open to such abuse in forestry that we are reluctant to use tax relief as a mechanism for securing viable and sensible forestry objectives, because it might encourage forestry operations that were not sensible or acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having stated that as a broad principle, and having said that we prefer grants to tax relief, I have to say that the new clause, in particular the part that deals with tax relief for maintenance, is a substantial improvement on the new clause that we considered last year. Some of the difficulties that we pointed out on that occasion have been ironed out in the preparation of this new clause. Especially welcome is the restriction of relief to the maintenance of indigenous woodlands. However, that gives cause for thought because the word "indigenous" and the definition in subsection (5)(a) can be improved. It leaves open a substantial loophole. None the less, the intention is clear, and that is to ensure that the benefits under the new clause are available principally for broadleaved woodlands, rather than for the less natural coniferous plantations that have been a cause for concern in many places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other improvements in the new clause. Last year's proposal would have enabled a farmer in Gloucestershire to claim tax relief for planting a section of the Flow country in Caithness or Sutherland. The new clause seems to have dealt with that viring of ability from one end of the country to the other. It also seems to have dealt with the problem, that last year's new clause sought to assist planting as well as maintenance. This new clause is more strictly geared towards assistance for maintenance. But having said that, and although it is a welcome improvement, we would prefer to follow
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
the grants road in assisting maintenance, rather than that of fiscal relief. I do not buy the argument that a tax relief structure is much more certain for the landowner. A grants sytem can also be stable, it can enable long-term planning, and if it is properly in place, it can assist good conservation-minded maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have less sympathy with the other two parts of the new clause. In its briefing on the capital gains tax proposal, the Country Landowners Association says that there is no strong argument for this exemption per se. It states that that is an arguable case only if the changes in inheritance tax are introduced simply to make the picture more logical. It raises the question of whether land under woodlands should be treated differently from any other land in assesssing capital gains tax. There is no major argument in support of that thesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the inheritance tax proposal may have a detrimental effect on conservation because, as I understand it, there are existing mechanisms to provide relief for inheritance tax on forest land, provided that it is well-managed and preservation-oriented rather than commercial woodland. The change proposed in the new clause would eliminate that inducement to conserve by making an inheritance tax exemption regardless of the conservation values attached to a particular woodland. We would be as reluctant to support the proposals in the inheritance tax section of the new clause as we are to support the capital gains tax proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that our approach would be by grant rather than by tax relief, but we must ensure that the grants system works properly. Sadly, it appears that the grants system that was introduced in the recent past is not working as well as it might. In particular, the use of the farm woodland scheme has been disappointing. It would repay study by the Government to see how it could be improved and built upon to ensure much greater availability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) has a close interest in those matters as an Opposition Front-Bench spokesman on agriculture. He recently asked the Secretary of State for Scotland for planting and restocking figures for the old-style tax relief mechanism under the transitional provisions and for the woodland grant and farm woodland scheme. The figures are revealing. Taking England, Scotland and Wales together, the total for planting and restocking under the woodland grant and farm woodland scheme for the year from April 1988 to March 1989 was 440 hectares. In the meantime, planting and restocking under other, older mechanisms amounted in all three countries to 24,660 hectares. The difference is obvious: the major planting and restocking processes are going on under the old mechanisms rather than the new grant system. Using grants is the right principle, but there are questions to ask the Government about how well the grant systems are operating. Changes may be needed to ensure that they can further assist, the two basic objectives: the encouragement and assistance of good quality maintenance and the encouragement of small-scale lowland planting of high quality and principally of broadleaved trees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said. He introduced the new clause as a probing one and no one would pretend that it is other than that. We want to find out what the Government think about the residual problem that has arisen from the major change in tax law that was so widely welcomed last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was kind enough to allude to an open day that he recently attended in my constituency, as did many other hon. Members and guests, in the ancient and royal forest of Rockingham. On that small estate with long-term planning, we saw some of the consequences that resulted from the changes introduced last year. Those changes have left gaps that must be filled before 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not possible to correct the difficulties that have arisen this year, I hope that the consequence of our debate on the new clause will be to stimulate further thought from my right hon. Friends about how they will solve those very real problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight air of unreality about some of the comments from the Labour Front Bench on the nature of forestry and the objectives to be pursued. In my constituency, forestry is not simply a matter of tidying up and planting a few selected trees in the lowlands around the farms. It is a major commercial industry that employs many people in the industry itself and in ancillary industries dependent upon it, even though the work force has been significantly reduced. I have seen the effects of forestry village houses being turned into second homes and many people having to look to contracting as a means of employment in forestry. Nevertheless, forestry is still an important part of the rural economy and must continue as a successful commercial operation to remain so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Achieving effective grants and taxation policies for forestry is a bit like walking a tightrope; if we fall down one side, there is no economic sense in long-term forestry because it is taxed out of existence; if we fall down the other side, we create a tax haven that attracts funds from people with no genuine long-term interest in forestry. That is a difficult tightrope on which to remain. You Mr. Cormack, will recall Finance Bills when you were not in the Chair but an active participant. Your efforts, those of others, including myself, and those of other Governments have tried to get this right. Who is to say that we got it right? Perhaps some of the concessions that we extracted from the Labour Government have turned into the loopholes that were exploited in later years. It is very difficult to get the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, having turned to a grant-system in an earlier Finance Bill, must be given a chance to make that system work. However, they must review the detailed effects of that system, as the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) sensibly suggested. Many of the objectives set out in the new clause could be met by adaptations of grant policy. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is no doctrinaire reason to go one way or the other. At
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
the moment there is a presumption, because only recently we started using the grant system to meet these needs. I know that the Minister will not take it amiss if we use him in part as a messenger to those Ministers who are more directly involved in grant policy, because we know that he has to sign the cheques in the end and that he and his colleagues have to approve any changes in the grant system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key factors leading to a change in the basic system was the belief that the tax relief system had not merely attracted hot money into forestry but had encouraged forestry that was environmentally unsatisfactory and greatly disliked, such as solid blocks of conifers stretching across the uplands. The problems cannot be dealt with by the new planting policy. In so far as the grant system encourages attractive, broadleaf plantations in lowland areas, which may be a good thing, it does not alter a single block of standing conifers on a hillside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and others are genuinely worried about the environmental effect of past forestry policy, they must look for ways of introducing development policies that allow us to move from the standing blocks and straight lines towards environmentally sensitive forestry. Plenty of people in the industry are willing to do that; the skill and the expertise exist and interest is developing in looking for ways to manage, develop and invest further in forests, to ensure that they enhance, rather than detract from, the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we adopt the tax relief option in the new clause suggested by the hon. Member for Daventry, new aspects to the grants scheme are necessary to enable the maintenance and development of existing forecasts; otherwise the figures that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) produced will tell a story of the grant scheme fiddling around at the environmentally desirable edges of forestry policy without affecting the main forests. That is what caused people to think that something was wrong with the old policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Treasury Ministers are not willing to go along the tax relief road suggested in the new clause, they should look again at the grant scheme to try to find ways to ensure that we have not merely a policy for better, new forestry development in the future, but a policy for the better management and development of existing forests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) for tabling the new clause, which enables us to revisit one of the most interesting aspects of last year's Finance Bill. Our debate last year was extremely interesting and it enabled Conservative and Opposition Members to agree that the previous policy was doubly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the policy was wrong because the style of forestry adopted was increasingly displeasing, as it is was out of sympathy with the countryside. Secondly, the very people who were planting the trees did not deserve public help. They were receiving a tax benefit that was not justified under any criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the debate has come up again this year. I hope that the Financial Secretary will not stick strictly to the terms of the new clause but will treat
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
the subject in the context of how it fits in with the policy change made last year. I doubt whether there will be a chance for a debate on forestry in the House before next year's Finance Bill. Last year, a change was made in taxation policy. Its intention was to remove benefits from those who did not deserve them and to encourage a more sympathetic development of forestry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there is a need for that. The Countryside Commission states that between 1947 and 1980 the area of coniferous woodland in England and Wales increased by 250 per cent. and that the area of broadleaf woodland decreased by 40 per cent. I hope that the Financial Secretary can assure us that the intention of last year's policy changes has been fulfilled and that the new policy is working better, as I have seen no material to justify or to deny that. I hope that the Financial Secretary will range broadly over the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee, and especially to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), for raising this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with many of the points made by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), particularly with his view that the main thrust of policy in future should be through grants. I also agreed with other points that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) correctly said that we must remember that forestry is not just about farm woodlands or what is environmentally acceptable; it is a rural industry and a major employer in the hon. Gentleman's part of the country, in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the uncertainty in the industry, to the dip in planting and to the trees that have to be burned after tax changes. We always expected that there would be some dip in new planting figures after the tax changes. We hope that it will prove to be temporary, before the industry returns to the more controlled and environmentally sensitive position that is was in before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial response to the new woodland grant scheme leads us to be reasonably optimistic that the downturn will be temporary. By the end of April the Forestry Commission had received application for nearly 36,000 hectares of new planting, of which over 20,000 hectares were for new areas not in any previous grant scheme. That encouraging start confirms the Government's decision to opt for a grants-only system. I accept the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that these are early days. We cannot be certain. He said that the industry will present Government with its views. Obviously, we shall listen and we look forward to hearing those representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we fall significantly short of our aims over the next few years, we shall examine the reasons why and take any necessary sensible action. Sometimes a degree of alarmism is put around. In this morning's edition of 	<i>The Independent</i> an article referred to
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
nurserymen having to uproot and destroy some of their stock. The gentleman quoted in the article represents Christies of Fochabers in Morayshire. Despite having to destroy some stock, he is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'The Government's long-term policy is not far wrong. We think that it will come right. The demand for timber is there.'"</p></blockquote>
The secretary of the Royal Scottish Forestry Society is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'the prospects seem to be better. It's a question of attracting a different type of investor. There's still money to be made in planting trees.'"</p></blockquote>
That is what we want—a different type of investor. But we want money to be made from trees and the industry to thrive as it did before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to the need for planting on a small scale. That is a matter for the Department of the Environment, but it is encouraged under the farm woodland scheme, which covers planting of areas up to 40 hectares and builds in a system that tilts towards small-scale planting of trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, his new clause is divided into three parts. The first part deals with maintenance. An important point of principle is at stake. One of our main purposes last year was to amend the much criticised anomalous tax regime that allowed relief for expenditure on commercial woodlands, but did not charge the profits to tax. Admittedly, subsection (1) of the new clause targets relief narrowly; it is confined to the costs of maintaining traditional woodland and allows those costs to be offset only against agricultural income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury that this is an improvement, but my hon. Friend's new clause would give tax relief for an expenditure on an activity—commercial woodlands—the profits from which, under the new regime, will not be taxable. That is precisely what last year's changes were designed to prevent. I should also mention that amenity woodlands have not been within the tax system for more than 25 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that I believe that the main thrust of support for forestry should be through the grant system. As my hon. Friend knows, part of the grant system is geared towards maintenance. People may wish to argue about whether what is included in the grant system is adequate for maintenance or appropriately targeted, and we shall discuss that. However, there is provision for maintenance, and I believe that the way in which we should provide for maintenance in future is through the grant system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend acknowledged that it is very early days yet to tell precisely how the new regime is working. We must give it a little time to settle down, but we look forward to the representations that we shall receive in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's provisions to do with capital gains tax, under present rules the trees—whether standing or felled—already have capital gains exemption. There can be no justification for exempting the underlying land. The gains on the land
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
may be substantial: for example, a woodland on the edge of a town or village may acquire substantial development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, for inheritance tax, subsection (4) of the new clause would replace the existing inheritance tax woodlands relief, which is specifically designed to cater for the special characteristics of trees as slowly maturing assets, with blanket exemption. However, my hon. Friend will know that the present relief allows deferment of the inheritance tax if an election to defer is made. The value of the trees but not the land may be left out of account until a subsequent disposal. If the legatee dies before disposal, that cancels any deferred charge and a further deferment may be made. So there is substantial and generous treatment for forestry under inheritance tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made the point that I would have expected him to make: "You're taking forestry out of the income tax system; why not take it completely out of the inheritance tax system?" But we have to recognise that we have taken it out of the income tax system simply because no satisfactory income tax system could be devised for an activity in which the bulk of expenditure is incurred up to a century before the bulk of the income arises. It is extraordinarily difficult to devise a satisfactory regime for that, and that is why we took forestry out of income tax. That is rather a specific reason, and the same considerations do not apply to inheritance tax. I put it to my hon. Friend that there is already good and generous provision under the inheritance tax regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has raised the question of maintenance with me before and he knows that I am well aware of it. I believe that it should be tackled through the grant system, and we shall consult the industry about that. I am not committing us to any particular course of action on grants, but that seems to be the proper way of proceeding. We shall do whatever seems to be necessary as the planting situation becomes clear. I assure my hon. Friend that I shall be in touch with my colleagues responsible for forestry and will put his points to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the new clause is to allow tax relief for loans for the reinstatement of the defective pre-cast reinforced concrete homes which are quite common in many constituencies. Such houses were built in the belief that a new technology had been found which could produce houses quickly and did not have serious problems. But serious problems there proved to be, as we all know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Act 1988 removed tax relief for home improvement loans. It was argued that it was widely abused and led to people obtaining tax relief for loans that were nothing to do with home improvement, or were not essential to house purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The side effect has been to deter thousands of tenants living in council-owned pre-stressed reinforced concrete houses from buying their homes because of serious structural defects. Although the tenants may be able to buy the houses very cheaply, those properties are virtually worthless unless they are fully reinstated. That can be an expensive operation, costing many times the purchase price of the house.

	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
Following the change in the Finance Act 1988, a loan taken out for reinstatement does not qualify for tax relief. Unlike the tenant across the street buying a standard house and obtaining tax relief on up to £30,000 worth mortgage interest, someone buying a defective house pays a relatively small capital sum—perhaps only £7,000 or £8,000—but may have to borrow £20,000 or £30,000 to ensure that the house has a subsequent resale value. As he receives no tax relief on that large sum, he is at a disadvantage compared with the person buying the standard house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem likely that the Chancellor intended to deter home ownership or to disadvantage that already unsettled and uncomfortable group of people living in defective houses. But that seems to be the effect of the change in the 1988 Budget. I have had a long correspondence with the Chancellor on this subject; no doubt the Financial Secretary is aware of it. However, none of that correspondence has dealt with the problem of those who are now candidates for the purchase of their defective houses but who are deterred from buying them. Home improvement grants are not the answer in such circumstances, nor do the provisions of the Housing Defects Act 1984 meet the case.

In view of the purpose of the new clause and the particular circumstances that it adumbrates, I hope that the Government will see a way to resolving the dilemma that a number of people face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An area such as mine has a large number of stone-built houses which were thrown up about a century ago, and many of them, to mix my metaphors, fall between two stools. Often they do not qualify for grants and householders have to take out large loans to pay for improvements. They are not likely to fall down because they often have walls that are three feet thick and are built from the local rock, but they frequently need the addition of the most basic requirements to make them inhabitable or to improve them. There are many such houses in my constituency and in other Welsh constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that we do not miss a chance here to improve the fabric of housing in such areas. We should not assume that it is right to turn the whole of Wales, like so much of the rest of the country, into Reading, West, with those awful new red-brick estates which are thrown up everywhere like a new Toytown sprawl and which make everywhere look alike. Here is a chance to look after the special character of some

Member for Beith, when I meant the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). This area is beset with pitfalls and I should like to cite a few examples from my constituency. A large number of my constituents own what are known as Dorlonco homes. Dorlonco homes do not come within the scope of the Housing Defects Act 1984, although whenever Ogwr borough council and other councils which own these homes carry out refurbishment programmes they frequently need to carry out structural improvement to ensure that the houses have a long life ahead of them. The owners of these houses would benefit if they could get tax relief for the money that they need to carry out substantial work to ensure the long life of the structure. Because their houses are not covered by the Housing Defects Act, they are not eligible for the grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some houses are eligible for the grants, but the cost of completing the work is many thousands of pounds more than the available grant. One such case in my constituency could develop in a nasty way. It appears that those involved will have to go out to tender again for the repair of some houses and the new tender is likely to be many thousands of pounds more than the amount that has been set aside for grant work. These people would benefit from a repair that is essential to maintain the safety of their homes, yet because of last year's legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Like many members of the Committee, I spent a year during the previous Parliament in close contact with constituents who lived in defective houses and were concerned with the issue while the Bill was going through Parliament. When the problem of defective housing had emerged, Parliament as a whole felt that the first priority was to people who had exercised their right to buy and had bought from a council a house that they had thought was sound but then found that they had bought a pig in a poke. We made generous provision for them through the Housing Defects Act 1984, which enables them to receive grants of 90 per cent. of the cost of reinstating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
their houses and making good the problems caused by the defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of those who bought a house knowing that such defects existed is of a different order and a lesser problem. It is more difficult to say that there is a distinction between houses with this sort of problem and houses with defects for reasons other than those concerning prefabricated reinforced concrete. It would be difficult for the Committee to ring fence this sort of provision and to make it available only to those who bought houses knowing that this sort of defect existed and not to those who bought other houses. I believe that the hon. Members for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) and for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) recognise that other categories of houses may require some reinstatement and improvement. Such houses are not covered by the Housing Defects Act 1984 and would not be covered by the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to believe that the new clause would have a significant effect. It was only in last year's Budget that availability of mortgage interest relief for improvements and repairs was ended. Prior to that, tenants exercising their right to buy and others buying houses from a council were able to obtain mortgage interest relief on repairs, but there is no evidence that a significant number did so. That is perhaps explicable when considering that those residents operated with a total of £30,000. A repair mortgage was not additional to the £30,000, so the £30,000 was available for both purchase and repair. Only if the value of the house was very small would there be capacity within a tax deductible mortgage to carry out repairs, which average £20,000 a house. The interest on that would be approximately £2,700 a year and the tax benefit approximately £700. The benefit was not huge and was not likely to change people who were reluctant to purchase that sort of house, knowing the problems that existed from unwilling to willing purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee not to accept the new clause which would introduce a new complexity into the mortgage interest relief system, which we have simplified, which would be difficult to ring fence and contain, and which does not meet the principle problem that has already been met in the Housing Defects Act 1984. The provisions of that Act cover the problems of those who bought houses not knowing the sort of defects which would appear in the long term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very disappointing reply. Unusually for a ministerial reply, the Minister has given every reason to suppose that the provisions of the new clause would not be very costly. Indeed, he sought to set out that those who would be covered by the new clause included a category of people who have had the opportunity to benefit from tax relief in the period up to the previous Finance Act 1988, but who did not do so in large numbers—so he presumed that not many people would do so in the future, unless the provision were greatly widened so that there was no longer a ring fence round that category of people. We are discussing a provision that would not be costly to the Government, but which would be important for the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
There is a difference between those who are the subject of the Housing Defects Act 1984, having bought a pig in a poke—to use the Minister's phrase—and those who knowingly consider buying a defective house. That difference is reflected by the fact that the first group of people were provided with automatic access to 90 per cent. grants, or possibly 100 per cent. in exceptional circumstances. The new clause does not seek that, but that tax relief should be available to anyone who in buying a house uses up the £30,000 relief on the mortgage itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is being unrealistic in not recognising that many of those houses, if purchased, would cost very little initially but would require a large sum to be spent on them, so the mortgage position of someone who has a defective house is quite different from someone in a standard house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be unenthusiastic about the right to buy if he thinks that that group of people can be cast aside. They must live in those houses and their opportunity to exercise their right to buy is tied up with the defective house. The Minister has shown himself to be unsympathetic to such people and we must return to the matter. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We turn to the different subject of taxation of compensation for loss of office, especially as it affects a group of public servants, such as civil servants, lecturers and teachers. The liability for income tax on gifts of money as compensation for loss of office occupied the courts over many years, but it became established that such gifts were not taxable under the general law. In the early 1950s the Revenue requested the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income to consider whether gifts of money as compensation for loss of office, being in substance a form of income, should be taxed. The Royal Commission recommended accordingly. In the 1960 Budget statement, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed legislation to make all gifts of compensation for loss of office which would not otherwise be taxable, liable to tax under schedule E, with exemption for compensation payments of limited amounts to manual workers and clerical staff who were not the target of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder what huge sums they will receive, but they will not gain much benefit from the provisions as there is a £30,000 limit on the relief available. Perhaps we will find out later who will be involved, but we are considering an altogether more deserving category of people whose incomes are much smaller.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words 'not otherwise taxable' seem to have been used to make it clear that the legislation would not apply to compensation payments for loss of office made under the terms of a contract of employment since such payments are not gifts but a contractual entitlement and thus taxable as a part of the emoluments of the lost office. However, the Inland Revenue argues that gifts of compensation for loss of office which are made on a periodical basis until some specified event occurs, and which therefore must be without any pre-determined total sum, bear the characteristics of annual payments for tax purposes and are liable consequently to tax under schedule D. Thus these types of compensation payments are otherwise taxable and not subject to the exemption from tax provided in the legislation for gifts of compensation for loss of office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is thought that between 5,000 and 10,000 taxpayers may be affected as it is only local government employees, teachers and lecturers who have received gifts of compensation for loss of office since March 1976 who are involved. If the average periodical payment of compensation is assumed to be £1,000 per annum then the cost to the Treasury would be the tax, probably at basic rate, on £10 million, which is £2.5 million. The loss of revenue would not be likely to increase significantly in the long term, as once the exemption from tax had been used up the periodical payments would become taxable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reasonable man might feel that the Inland Revenue should take a broad view and use its powers to grant a concession. However, the Revenue, not surprisingly, seems to say that it is for Parliament to decide on the taxation of a citizen's income, so the anomalies should be put right by the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to ensure that all gifts of compensation for loss of office are treated in the same way for tax purposes, regardless of the method of payment selected by the institutional body which pays the compensation. It is not within the choice of the person being compensated to decide whether he receives periodical payments or a lump sum in many instances. As I said, those include public servants, teachers and lecturers who have lost office because of reorganisation schemes. I am referring mainly to the lower end of the scale because of the limit that is imposed on the relief. Will the Minister consider the problem sympathetically?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) recounted correctly the history of
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
taxation in this sector and, to the Committee's relief, thereby saved me from repeating it. At present, a lump sum is taxable beyond £30,000. The first £30,000 plus statutory redundancy arrangements are free of tax. If a person, on losing his job, is granted an ongoing income, that income will usually be liable to tax under one or other form of taxation of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that an anomaly exists in such treatment. If one did not consider that the justification of a distinction between a capital sum and ongoing income was sufficient, the natural way in which to remove that anomaly would be to extend taxation throughout the system. If the hon. Gentleman were concerned primarily about the anomaly, presumably he would take that approach. However, if he were more interested in extending the concession, such a proposal would not be attractive to the Committee, the general mood of which is against extending tax relief to new sectors. It is possible for an employer to pay out £30,000 as a lump sum, tax free, if he wishes to do so, or if his employees and their negotiators persuade him to do so. Therefore, employers can benefit from such tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) asked whether Ministers would benefit in large measure from the arrangements that, I think, will be discussed in the Chamber later this evening. I do not wish to comment on that. However, after the next general election, when I confidently predict that the Tory swing in her constituency will, regrettably, deprive us of her presence, the existing arrangements for Members of Parliament will ensure that the hon. Lady, although having been with us for only one Parliament, will receive more in tax-free compensation, than any Minister will under the arrangements to which she referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has let the cat out of the bag by revealing the relatively poorer position in which a small group of public servants are left. He did not mention the fact that so many public servants do not enjoy choice in the manner in which the payment is made, as they are subject to long-standing public service arrangements which are not susceptible of renegotiation between the individual employee and the employer, which is usually some kind of public body. It would be a simple matter for such an employee to say, "In my case, will you make a single lump-sum payment because that will be tax advantageous for me?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the employee is trapped in long-standing public service arrangements which may even be in the course of being changed but which cannot be changed for his individual case, he will suffer a serious tax disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene rather than make another speech? When the payment of a lump sum or a continuing payment is the result of a contractual arrangement, there is no tax relief. If one enters into a contract which provides that, in certain circumstances, one will get £30,000, that amount will not be tax relieved whether it is given as a lump sum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I referred to arrangements I did not mean contracts. Perhaps it would have been better to have said, "Long-standing public service practices". By its very nature, a large-scale public service employer does not generally have the capacity to respond kindly to an individual who asks, "Please can you deal with my case in a completely different way?" Westminster city council may offer large payments to those of its staff who wish to retire to get away from its dismal record of selling cemeteries at 15p a time, and it may be able to negotiate individual arrangements. That seems to have happened in certain recent cases but, lower down the scale, many people are adversely affected and I wish that Ministers would pay careful attention to their cases in future.

The new clause follows the same principle as the new clause that I moved last year in Standing
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
Committee "A" dealing with the Finance Bill; it proposed to improve tax relief on training. Because that measure was an open-ended and potentially costly proposal, this year the new clause has been drawn far more narrowly, in conjunction with the Open University and with the support, in principle, of the Association of British Correspondence Colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to allow tax relief for employed individuals who pay their own fees and expenses for materials in training and are engaged in part-time study while in work, who receive no sponsorship or assistance from their employers, and whose studies lead to specific qualifications at postgraduate or post-experience level which can be recognised by the Department of Education and Science or bodies such as the Council for National Academic Awards and which are vocationally relevant to their performance in their jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the case for encouraging training, especially retraining and further skilling, needs to be made. The Government are well aware of the importance of this matter through their programmes such as open learning, open tech, PICKUP and the recent review of technical and vocational qualifications. The matter was recently taken up by the CBI, which has a review group under the chairman of the Post Office which is soon to report. It set up the charter management initiative to improve management education. It is estimated that in the next 20 years it will be necessary for the average person in employment to retrain to a significant extent twice or three times throughout his working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the pressures of maintaining an income, much of the training will be part-time. There are now 127,000 part-time students at United Kingdom universities, of whom 86,000 study at the Open University. Despite the long-term value of their studies to the economy, and the self-interest of their employers, many are refused assistance by their companies and have to scrimp and save for the external courses they take at the same time as doing ordinary jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been given three, anonymous, examples by the Open University: a gentleman aged 44 started a post-graduate diploma in the industrial applications of computers and after he had been studying for three years the company which had been sponsoring him, made him redundant and he was faced with financing the final year of his course himself, as his new employer would not back him up. That cost him about £1,750, plus the cost of the special equipment and software that he needed. Secondly, a woman aged 35 wanted to do a professional diploma in management and her studies cost her well over £2,000 over two years, and although the diploma was directly relevant to her employment she received no help with fees from her employers; she would now like to study for an MBA—Master of Business Administration—with the Open University, but is deterred by the cost. Finally, a Mr. Henry A, aged 44, wanted to do an MA degree in education, and over three years completed an advanced diploma in educational management which cost him about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
£2,000 for fees, summer schools, books and travel. These are all fees incurred by people who are working but engaged in part-time study, which means that they must have a considerable degree of commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position for tax relief is set out in section 198(1) of part V of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which deals with relief for necessary expenses. Apart from direct travelling expenses, and the cost of keeping a horse, the money must be expended.
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance"</p></blockquote>
of duties in relation to work. If the employer will not make any contribution towards training expenses, it is difficult for an employee to overcome that definitional obstacle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extra-statutory concession allows relief on training expenses paid by the student. Unfortunately, it is not much help, because it insists that the course be full-time, and in normal working hours—so a part-time Open University course will not qualify. It also insists that the course should be on consecutive days and in blocks of not less than four weeks; it does not allow any re-sits, and—rather illogically—the course need not necessarily lead to any particular qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these conditions militate against the motivated student who is prepared to make financial sacrifices to work in his own time for long periods—an Open University course can take up to six years—allowing himself no time off, for recognised qualifications. The extra-statutory concession goes nowhere. It is not surprising that our curious regime of disincentives is not duplicated in other industrialised countries. The DES PICKUP document, "Tax Concessions for Training" issued last year, suggests that our tax relief for employee training is amongst the most restrictive and least generous in the industrialised world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In France, although there is a general 10 per cent. allowance of taxable income for expenses including training, for anyone who wants to go above that figure and who is prepared to itemise his expenses and have them checked, tax relief is available on expenses incurred for training, and 3 per cent. of the French work force claim it.

In the United States, in addition to the standard deduction from taxable income of $2,500 for employees financing their own training, and if the costs are more than 2 per cent. of taxable income, all training costs, uniforms, professional fees and even use of part of the home for training purposes while in work are tax deductible if itemised. In West Germany virtually all training costs are fully deductible without limit so long as they are connected with maintaining or improving current or future earnings in the present occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the report shows that the UK is at the bottom of the league, along with Japan, in terms of tax concessions for adult training in relation to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
It is difficult to ascertain the costs of the new clause. The Open University has attempted to do so. It is difficult to anticipate what the additional take up of employee self-financed training would be with such tax concessions. But as 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. of their part-time students are in such areas as management, scientific and technological uprating, and masters degrees in business administration and manufacturing, the Open University estimates that the cost of the new clause at 1990 prices will be about £4 million a year. Given the proportion of part-time students catered for by the Open University, I estimate that the total cost for the UK wold be about £6 million, if the professional and vocational qualifications for that sort of tax relief are drawn tightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is well worth looking into. It encourages training and professional development, which will become increasingly necessary. It will put us more in line with our industrialised competitors and will give more students increased incentives, particularly mature students who wish to update their skills to the economy's benefit and their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition give a warm welcome to the new clause, although I suspect that it is defective in draftsmanship. Indeed, the opening words speak in an ill-defined fashion about "Tax relief, without specifying which tax. Immediately, I suspect that the new clause cannot, as it stands, go onto the statute book. None the less, we would support, the principle behind it and the reasons advanced by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombes). Part of the Opposition's criticism of the way in which the economy has been going is that the lack of proper training for people in the workforce wanting to develop new and better skills is a major supply-side constraint on the British economy. It militates against the personal development of employees and the overall benefit of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existence of valuable institutions such as the Open University, correspondence institutions and open learning facilities needs to be encouraged and developed, rather than militated against. The new clause would give such encouragement. The first reason for wanting to support it is that it greatly encourages the training and improved skilling of the workforce, which we would welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who take correspondence courses in this way are not eligible in overwhelming proportions for grants in the same way as other students. There is £600,000 available in grant monies from the Department of Education and Science to help unemployed students in the Open University, but that is about it. An employee who takes a course in his spare time to improve his skills is not eligible for grant assistance as such. The proposed tax relief would be a small assistance. At present, an employer stands to benefit considerably from the new training that his employee receives, but the employee gains little apart from the knowledge and skill that he develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We welcome the new clause. I suspect that the Government will identify its drafting defects, but we

	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
hope that, none the less, they will accept the principle, give it a fair wind and undertake to come back on Report with their own proposals to improve the position of people wishing to take training and skill development. We support the hon. Member for Wyre Forest in his aims with considerable pleasure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs). A number of people who undertake part-time post-graduate courses are discriminated against unfairly compared with people undertaking full-time courses.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. None of us can hear the hon. Gentleman. Will he repeat himself, but briefly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly there are a number of skill shortages, so it seems a good idea to encourage those who wish to surmount the problem and increase their skills, as this would benefit the community. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that to do so would, in the medium and long term, be a good investment for the country and the Treasury. I urge him to consider the new clause carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a large body of factual evidence that this country falls behind its competitors in training. There is wide consensus that greater investment could be made in training. The Government have a Budget surplus. Investment in training via established institutions that are seen to do a good job in part-time training and which employ people at their own expense is an obvious way to direct some of the surplus. It would place such people on the same footing as some self-employed people who can gain the benefit of tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will have been surprised to hear the details of the extra-statutory concession that were explained carefully by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs). It was so unbelievably restricted that an Open University course qualification would be necessary to work out whether there was an Open University course that could be undertaken with the benefit of the concession. The least the Minister can do tonight, even if he does not undertake to come back on Report with a similar new clause, is to agree to look again at the concession to see whether he could not make it more realistic and available to those who finance their own postgraduate education—not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of their employers—at their own expense, and seek relief from tax on the income that they expend in this way. I invite the Minister at least to look at the concession much more broadly and, preferably, to go as far as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) on bringing the matter to our attention. His new clause tackles some serious problems. Constituencies such as mine, which are seeing a transition to a new era of employment with new industries, are experiencing an acute shortage of special skills, especially those such as higher engineering and financial management. Given the
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
restrictions on training, retraining and on further education, the Government must begin to open new avenues. The new clause would be one method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see open-ended credits, which would allow students of any age to take advantage of opportunities for retraining in higher education. The new clause points the way forward. Like other hon. Members, I hope that the Minister will take it on board in his future deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee's reception to the new clause has been warm. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) has supported my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), and the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and other hon. Gentlemen have urged us to consider it. I cannot come back on Report, but I am prepared to say that we will review the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest has spelt out the reasons why we should consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many fundamental difficulties, although I do not criticise the new clause on grounds of technicalities or cost. My hon. Friend's figures are broadly right—if anything, they are an overestimate—but there are some fundamental problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the deadweight costs of any relief in relation to its total cost are likely to be high. Secondly, it is difficult to ring fence a relief so that is geared towards training rather than towards recreational skills. What is training to one person may be recreational skills to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, the tightness of the schedule E expenses rule, and the wholly necessary and exclusive criterion to which he referred, has knock-on effects in many parts of the tax system. We shall certainly review the proposal. There are several specific arguments, in addition to the general ones, against the new clause, but I shall not go into them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also several issues relating to the PICKUP report. Although, as my hon. Friend said, the report contrasted personal reliefs in this country with those in other countries, it also said that the main thrust of training should be through employers, and that the deductions available to employers in this country compared well with those available elsewhere. My hon. Friend has raised an important matter, and I undertake that we will review it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. There is no doubt that the new clause is technically defective. The Minister said that the PICKUP report referred to the relative generosity of the tax relief available to employers on training expenses. The new clause is carefully couched in forms of the tax relief that should be available for employees who are financing their own training expenditure without any financial commitment from an employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I do not wish to detain the Committee's progress, but I hope that he will not be too beguiled by his right hon. Friend's dismissal of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
what he described as the fundamentals of his new clause. A Treasury Minister will make those arguments against any proposal. Although I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is about to withdraw the motion, I hope that he will keep urging his right hon. Friend to bring forward concrete proposals at an early date and not at some dim and distant date in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman need not worry too much, because I moved a similar new clause last year and no doubt I shall move a similar one next year, unless, as I hope, it will not be necessary. Significant changes need to be made to schedule D, as my right hon. Friend said, but I do not agree that the difficulties with ring fencing are of particular significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cormack. Is it in order to use a word that is not known to the English language? I have consulted the largest possible edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, and nowhere in it can I find the verb "to ring fence". It must be assumed that the word is a total stranger to the English language. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), who is a classical scholar of some distinction, tells me that the test of a literate sentence is whether it can be translated into and back from the Latin language. He tells me that any sentence that contains a verb "to ring fence"—and, indeed, an expression about a concrete proposal—is quite incapable of translation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At nearly a quarter past 11, I am fully aware that again I have drawn a short political straw. This is the fifth successive year that it has been my privilege to be a member of the Finance Bill Committee, and I have reached the conclusion that the great merit in Government Back Benchers tabling amendments lies not in the detailed presentation of arguments, but in probing and inviting a full response from our hon. Friend's on the Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 48 can be described very simply. It seeks to abolish a distinction that exists between the tax treatment of short interest and that of yearly interest. Under section 338 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, where it applies, a paying company benefits from tax deduction if yearly interest is paid to any type of payee. But a paying company benefits from tax deduction only if short interest is paid to a bank, a member of the stock exchange or a discount house. New clause 48 seeks to give companies tax relief for short interest paid by them in the same way as they get relief for yearly interest under section 338 of the 1988 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary knows the full supporting arguments because they have been put to him by a number of individuals and organisations on many occasions. Likewise, members of the Committee know those arguments. So instead of my going through the arguments, I ask my right hon. Friend to acknowledge them and comment on the discrepancy that exists in our present laws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hour is late. Alas, my hon. Friend has raised a complicated matter. The new clause proposes the removal of the current restrictions on the deductibility of short interest as a charge against the total profits of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax law makes a distinction between annual interest and short interest, which may be described as interest on loans for a fixed period short of a year, or interest on loans which are truly repayable on demand—for example, bank overdrafts. Annual interest, on the other hand, arises on loans capable of lasting for a period of a year or more which are not repayable on demand if the other conditions of the loan are met. The distinction is important because it is one of the factors that governs whether income tax should be deducted on making payments of interest. The deduction rules apply only to annual interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as annual interest is concerned, a company is allowed a deduction against trading income where the interest is paid to bank and the loan is used wholly and exclusively for trading purposes. All other annual interest is allowed as a charge. My hon. Friend will appreciate that a charge is less favourable to a company than a deduction—it is rather more limited. It is allowed as a charge on the company's profits, and payments of interest to lenders are generally made under deduction of tax at the basic rate unless the lender is a bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
The position for short interest is different. Short interest is paid gross to all lenders. It is allowed as a deduction from a trading company's income provided it is related wholly and exclusively to the purposes of the trade, without restriction as to the lender. But any short interest not relating to the trading activities of the company is deductible as a charge only if it is paid to a United Kingdom bank, discount house or member of the Stock Exchange. It is that restriction that my hon. Friend seeks to remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the new clause would be to allow short interest paid to lenders other than those specified by the Act to qualify for deduction as a charge on profit. It is true that this would give an added measure of flexibility to companies in their short-term financing strategies. It would effectively allow companies to deduct interest from their profits, whatever the purpose of the loan or the nature of the lender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, however, two main objections to this proposal. First a company can normally already achieve all the legitimate commercial ends that my hon. Friend has in mind by a judicious arrangement of its sources of finance. Secondly, the new clause has the very serious effect of increasing, for companies which are members of corporate groups, the scope to reduce their tax liability by making short-term loans within the group for non-trading purposes. That would not necessarily be objectionable where all members of the group are based in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, where the group is a transnational one, there is very considerable scope for loss of Exchequer revenue. That arises from the possibility that a UK member could reduce its tax liability by borrowing short from a foreign member and deducting the interest from its profit. Since short interest is paid gross, the interest paid to the foreign lender would escape tax in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
My hon. Friend raised an interesting, although narrow, point. On balance, we consider that the risks to the Exchequer from the increased scope for a company to adjust its borrowing outweigh the fiscal risks that I have explained. It has a bearing on a matter of which my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) is aware, that of thin capitalisation. Some of the issues raised in this measure are similar. I cannot give my hon. Friend a firm assurance that we shall seek to make an early change of the kind that he has in mind, but we shall consider it alongside the conclusions that we want to reach on the issue of thin capitalisation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
