	<p>	<b>(Except clauses 1, 32, 33, 44, 51 and 138)</b></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before any hon. Members raise points of order about accommodation, I shall report to the Committee on the correspondence on that matter. No satisfactory solution has been found. The first letter that I shall read out is from the Assistant Serjeant at Arms to the Clerk. It states:
	<br><q><p>"Following our conversation in the Tea Room last evening I have looked into the possibility of your Committee returning to Room 10 as soon as the Party Meeting has finished there on Thursday evenings. I have instructed the Office Keepers on duty that they will come to see you personally and give you a few minutes warning that the Room will be available for you as soon as any necessary clearing up has been done.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>I hope the Chairman will find this arrangement helpful."</p></q>
I am sure that every attempt is being made to be helpful, but I do not think that the Committee would wish to move twice in one evening between Room 10 and Room 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My co-Chairman suggested the possibility of transferring all the sittings to the Grand Committee Room. That has been taken up but, for technical reasons, it cannot be done. Another letter explains why. It is from Mr. Jim Withers, Principal Assistant Editor of 	<i>Hansard,</i> to our Clerk. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The suggestion that the Finance Bill Committee meet in the Grand Committee Room raises a serious technical problem.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>On checking the system, a fault has been discovered somewhere in the 300-yard run of cable carrying the audio signal from the Room to Hansard's recording centre. I am told by our sound engineers that there is only a 50 per cent. recording facility—and reliability—as a result. Their suspicion is that the line has been moved slightly during building operations and is now touching a hot pipe."</p></q>
I assure hon. Members that it is not mine. The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Unfortunately, no effort can be made to trace the fault until the summer recess. To do so, it will be necessary to dismantle a 28-plug patching panel, which risks putting other Committee Rooms temporarily out of action.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Given every possibility of a breakdown and the ensuing disruption to proceedings, with the Committee having to move to another venue, you will understand my strong reservations about the use of the Grand Committee Room.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>In the circumstances, therefore, will you please convey my apologies to Mr. Cormack and members of the Committee?"</p></q>
The other letter is from the Assistant Serjeant at Arms. It states that the Serjeant at Arms would co-operate and that the Committee could move to the Grand Committee Room but that in view of the technical problems raised by 	<i>Hansard,</i> it is not feasible. We are back to the position of starting in this Room on Thursdays and moving to Room 10 later. The alternative was to start in Room 10, move to Room 9 before the Parliamentary Labour Party
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
meeting and then move back afterwards, but I do not think that two moves would be a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that the PLP should be approached. The Assistant Serjeant at Arm's letter states:
	<br><q><p>"the Serjeant at Arms made an approach to the Parliamentary Labour Party to ask if, given the special circumstances relating to Standing Committee G, the Party would agree to move to another room for their Thursday meetings until the end of June, I have learned that this request has been refused."</p></q>
That means that we are back to square one. I regret the inconvenience and discomfort that that causes to right hon. and hon. Members, but the only sensible way is to proceed as we did last week and start in this Room and move into Room 10 later in the evening, unless there are alternative suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask, through you, Mr. Crowther, whether 	<i>Hansard</i> can plug a tape recorder directly into its control panel in the Control Room, so avoiding the necessity for the message to travel down the cable? The Treasury press department will offer technical advice on such matters. At the end of the day, the tape could be carried the 300 yards, thereby avoiding hot pipes, to the 	<i>Hansard</i> office, so possibly achieving the outcome that we need. Alternatively, we could take the view that only half our proceedings are worth recording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. On the Minister's final point, we cannot determine in advance which half.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the 	<i>Hansard</i> representative is present and will have heard what has been said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, we have discussed relatively tame clauses. Many members of the public will probably wish to attend our debates on later, more controversial, clauses. We should consider not only the health and safety of hon. Members, but the ability of the public to see that we have a proper discussion on a very long Finance Bill. I hope that the sensible suggestion made by my hon. Friend will be taken up and considered seriously—perhaps more seriously than we sometimes feel such suggestions on accommodation are considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member that the matter has been considered seriously over the past few days. The correspondence between the Clerk and the Serjeant at Arms and 	<i>Hansard</i> shows that the problem has been taken seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Opposition and Conservative Members are happy to leave negotiations in your hands, Mr. Crowther, but the Minister's suggestion seems entirely sensible. Surely it is possible for 	<i>Hansard</i> to tape record the proceedings direct rather than rely on the cable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be investigated. No doubt my co-Chairman, who will chair the Committee next Tuesday, will report on the outcome of those investigations.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, several of my hon. Friends spoke eloquently about the caravan industry and of the importance of people with relatively modest means having a holiday caravan, or a caravan in the country that they can use. The effect of the clause would be to increase the cost to them. We must consider whether the clause will stop people using their caravans as they do now and also bear in mind that the caravan industry is a substantial leisure industry where small changes in costs can affect severely the number of caravans produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to link the change, which means that rents for certain pitches and facilities at seasonal caravan sites will be standard-rated for VAT, with the changes that are already occurring in Scotland as a result of the poll tax: that tax will also have an impact in England and Wales in the next year or so. Have the Government considered the issue in its totality, or have they simply considered VAT in England and Wales and the community charge in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland the taxation on caravans is a difficult issue. It is not the case that a caravan is a caravan—caravans are used in different styles for different purposes. When a caravan is used as a main residence in Scotland—some people live in their caravans the whole year—the caravan is taken out of the rating system. As is the intention with the poll tax, a personal poll tax is levied on all residents of the caravan. When a caravan is used as a second home for people who live elsewhere, a standard community charge is levied. I understand that there may be some difference in the English and Welsh legislation, but in Scotland that standard community charge can be set between one and two times, or twice, the personal poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area of Strathclyde, the regional council, as in every other part of Scotland, is levying a standard community charge at twice the level of the personal poll tax. That means a charge on the second home caravan of twice the poll tax—about £600 a year.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
Those who use their caravans as a second home are faced with extremely high charges—over £10 a week, regardless of rental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third type of caravan is the static leisure or holiday caravan, which sounds as though it is equivalent to the caravan to which the schedule refers. Such caravans will be dealt with in yet another way. They will remain on the valuation roll and will be rated. The 	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> of 16 May reported on the outcome of that for a resident of Argyll:
	<br><q><p>"A widow of 82 is threatening to take an axe to the caravan she keeps for occasional visits from her family, rather than pay rates for it.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Mrs. Judith Sugden, who lives in a cottage in Ardentinny, Argyll, believes she has no choice but to destroy the caravan she bought second-hand 10 years ago."</p></q>
She has the caravan for her children and grandchildren from Canada to sleep in when they visit her. The caravan has never been let for money and its sole purpose is as an adjunct to her home. That has been deemed to be a holiday home, although for that lady it is just a caravan in her garden. It is not on a licensed site. The article reports her as saying:
	<br><q><p>"'If I had an extension on my house I wouldn't be paying rates on it, and that's what the caravan in effect is.'"</p></q>
She now has a rates demand of £71 on top of her poll tax. She cannot understand that and feels that it is a terrible imposition:
	<br><q><p>"The Duke of Argyll is only paying the same as me with a bloody great castle.'"</p></q>
That is the problem with the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here are three kinds of caravan. I do not know whether the poll tax regulations are ready in England and Wales yet but they have already caused considerable problems in Scotland. Three different attitudes have been taken to what is a caravan. In one it is a second home and double the personal community charge of about £600 per year may be levied. Another is the main residence and the person will simply be paying a poll tax and the third kind is a static, leisure or holiday caravan which remains on the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister taken into account the fact that the Government will have to introduce the poll tax and a policy on caravans in England and Wales when considering the imposition of VAT on these seasonal caravan sites? Cumulatively, this will have a considerable impact on those who use caravans and upon the caravan industry. I want to be reassured that the Minister has thought about these issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Illsley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday when you were not here, Mr. Crowther, I made a few comments about people using caravans and I should like to reinforce those comments and to go into a little more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a decision that the Government have taken themselves and is not the result of European Community proposals. The Government have latched on to European issues and are using the current debate on VAT as an opportunity to levy VAT against a certain section of society, namely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
caravan owners who, in the main, are people on lower incomes or pensions. Although the excuse that the Government use is that they want to harmonise VAT on holiday accommodation in general, they do not want to see harmonisation in some other areas. It seems a little hypocritical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to equate caravans with other holiday accommodation seems entirely wrong. There is no real need to equate other holiday accommodation with caravans and caravan pitches. The caravans at issue here are those which are usually pitched for a season and they are mostly owned by older people such as old-age pensioners who have more leisure time than the average worker. People with increased leisure time can take advantage of having a caravan pitched for a longer time than the normal one or two-week holiday period. Such people usually have a fixed income. They are pensioners or on benefits or on a lower income. They see a caravan holiday as a cheaper type of holiday than a hotel of package holiday or than hiring a flat at a seaside resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current trend is more towards package holidays abroad and holidays in touring caravans with more modern facilities, but the caravans caught by the clause will be those owned by people least equipped to afford the increases in VAT. The advent of foreign package holidays and perhaps the increased emphasis on touring caravans has led to a decline in revenue at various caravan sites throughout the country. Over the past few years there have been dramatic increase in annual or seasonal rentals. VAT will be an added burden and will put more strain on those who own such caravans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the separation of utility fees from pitch fees, and said that in certain circumstances the fee could be separated into its component elements and VAT levied only upon a particular element, and not levied on other items that would not attract VAT. In my experience as a caravanner, the vast majority of short-term caravan pitches do not distinguish between the various elements of a site pitch. Most sites charge either per person on the site or on the number of vehicles, including motor vehicles, caravans or whatever. Therefore, it will be difficult for people to distinguish between the various elements of a site or pitch fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of various facilities, which refers back to the differentiation between other types of holiday accommodation and caravan sites. Holiday accommodation such as hotels will usually include bathrooms, showers, bar and leisure facilities, laundry, cleaning, restaurant facilities and a whole host of other facilities that could be provided, depending on the standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different types of caravan sites, but most of them are just fields, with basic facilities, such as toilets and showers. On top of that, hundrends of sites owned by caravan clubs are simply green fields. There is quite a difference between paying VAT on a site pitch in a green field with no facilities and paying VAT for holiday accommodation in a four-star hotel. That is the reason for the differentiation between hotel accommodation and caravan sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) referred to the poll
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
tax and VAT. With the imposition of the poll tax, business rates will be revalued, and many caravan sites that operate as businesses will have their rates revalued in line with the revaluation throughout the country. That in itself could lead to higher rates for many caravan sites, which could be passed through to the caravanner as an increased charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to a letter that I received from a constituent, which has been signed by six couples, all of whom have caravans at a site owned by East Lindsey district council. The have all attempted to sell their caravans in view of the increased charges that they have suffered this year through increased site fees and the imposition of VAT, but they have been unable to do so because of those charges, yet they cannot afford them. They are in a financial predicament. All earn low incomes or are pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to think again about the imposition of VAT on caravan sites. There is a reason for differentiation between hotel accommodation and caravan sites, which is related to the provision of facilities. Many caravan sites still do not have facilities that can enable them to be classed as holiday accommodation. Many sites are provided for the hobbyist, the caravanner who spends holidays caravanning, as opposed to keeping the caravan for holiday purposes. I ask the Government to reconsider their position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my absence on Tuesday. For unavoidable reasons I missed the first part of the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) is sitting in front of me now so that I do not block out his light as I did last week. However, I am even lighter than I was so I should block out less light than before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kirkcaldy may not bring the idea of caravan sites, sun and sand to the minds of hon. Members, but that would be wrong. The villages that make up part of my constituency contain large caravan sites. I have received representations from the owners of the sites, who will have to impose the charges, and from the residents of the sites, about the effect that the clause, if unamended, will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The owners have rightly complained that those who have provided better facilities through investing their own money will have to charge a correspondingly higher levy on the pitches. That is a tax on enterprise and on those trying to make a living. It is unfair. As other hon. Members stated, the users of the sites are often pensioners or people on limited incomes for whom the caravan is their only chance to take a break. It is fundamentally unfair to expect them to pay a higher price than they do now. I realise that it might be difficult, but I hope that the Minister will think again and answer some of the points made by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several further points have been raised today. I shall try to deal with them as rapidly, but as fully, as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) asked about the interaction between VAT and the rating and community charge system. I do not purport to be the world's leading
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
expert on the community charge, but I shall try to explain how the two interlink. The hon. Gentleman was right. There are several types of caravan site. The first is that on which the caravan is the primary residence. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the residents will pay the community charge per head. Of course, such caravans would have been zero-rated when the original van was purchased and will remain zero-rated for the site fee because it is not a seasonal site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are all-year-round sites where the caravan is a secondary residence. The hon. Gentleman is again correct to say that the residents will be charged in the same way as with second homes: they will pay two community charges per head. Again, the caravan will be zero-rated when purchased and the site fee will be zero-rated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there are the seasonal sites, with which the clause deals. Usually the caravan is not capable of travelling on the road. Therefore, it was zero-rated when purchased and installed. As I understand it, the community charge will not be levied on either a per head or a second home basis. The community charge will not be levied on the residents of seasonal sites. That follows the request of the caravan site owners who argued their case and convinced the Ministers involved. However, the Government believe that VAT should be imposed on the pitch fees because such sites are, by definition, for holiday use and other forms of holiday bear VAT. To take a level playing field approach, it is appropriate to put VAT on the fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also touring caravans that go to sites on a short-stay basis. There is no question of the community charge being imposed on them and the site fees are already subject to VAT. There is a reasonable balance between the treatment under the uniform business rate and the community charge and the introduction of VAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have difficulty understanding because the Minister is making a distinction between sites that are licensed all year round and those that are not. Different types of caravans may remain on one site and some may be used intermittently. Do people who use their caravan only in a seasonal way and leave it at one site throughout the year, now have to remove it from that site to avoid it being classified as a second home which would be subject to a standard community charge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is almost certainly the case, although we are not debating the operation of the community charge. If the caravan is a permanent residence available all year round, but used intermittently, it is a second home and therefore, subject to the community charge.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an inverse point. As I understand it, a non-seasonal caravan is one that cannot be lived in all year round. My point is unnecessary because no one would want to remove a caravan because site pitch fees would not have to be paid on a permanent all-year-round caravan. I withdraw my question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has answered his own question probably better than I could have done, but when I said that site fees on permanent sites and non-seasonal sites were zero-rated, I should have said exempt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about a caravan, which is owned by a third party, and let to people only during the holiday season, that remains on one site? Is it liable to VAT on the site rent or for the standard community charge? If the vehicle is removed and put into storage, is the storage charge liable for VAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to the question about the community charge on a caravan that is let out by the owner, but I shall endeavour to find out from my colleagues at the Department of the Environment. There is no change with holiday rentals. They are already standard rated and subject to VAT whether they are caravans or holiday flats. If the site was a beneficiary of the small trader exemption relief, which means that it does not have a total turnover of more than £23,600, it would not be required to register for VAT. That applies to all trades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) said that the Government were latching onto the European Community and trying to hit caravan owners at the same time. I made it clear that this was separate from, and not a necessary consequence of, the EC legislation although we think that it is appropriate to introduce the measure at this stage. There is no question of trying to con anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the hon. Gentleman's idea that the bulk of such caravans were occupied by those on low incomes and retired people, there may be a weighting in that direction—in my experience, there probably is—but some members of all sections of the community, whatever their income, like living in and taking their holidays in such caravans. The general philosophy behind VAT is that it is a broadly-based tax from which certain items are excluded by zero-rating but it is expected to fall as broadly as possible on all the rest. It is not to be used for fine-tuning between, for example, different holidays—which by definition are not as essential as, for example, food, which is zero-rated—on the grounds that certain types of holiday are more likely to be taken by one social group than another. It is an unsuitable tax to fine-tune in that way, and it would not be appropriate to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central also said that most caravan sites do not distinguish between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
the pitch and the cost of the utilities that are provided to the caravans on that pitch. They do not at present, but most will be able to. All that will be required will be a distinction between, say, the electricity going to all the caravans and the electricity going to other, separate facilities such as a heated swimming pool, bars or communal facilities. They would take the electricity going to all the caravans, divide by the number of caravans, then separate out that charge when presenting the bill to the caravans so that that element of the annual cost would not be subject to standard rate VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie), who is slimming by the instant and withering away, said that site owners had complained, rightly, that the more they invested in the site and consequently the higher the fees they needed and were able to charge, the higher the tax. I am afraid that that is true of all taxes. All taxes tend to rise as more income is generated from an activity. It could scarcely be otherwise—unless the hon. Gentleman wishes all taxes to be based on the principle of the community charge which has certain appropriate, but limited, applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that covers the points that have been raised. This is a sensible measure, and we have endeavoured to take the sting out of it by announcing, as I did at our previous sitting, the separate treatment of utility charges and rents. We are looking into the possibility of different treatment for the uniform business rate. I hope that hon. Members will accept that we are simply levelling the playing field and not in any way singling out seasonal caravan owners for punitive action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary was very honest when he said that the imposition of VAT on caravans was not a result of the infraction proceedings in the European Court but was something that the Conservative Government had decided to inflict upon caravan owners. It is an entirely voluntary tax, and they are now forcing it through this House because they have a majority of more than 100. A tax such as VAT, which is extremely cumbersome and involves a great deal of administration and many extra civil servants, should not be applied to site pitch fees, which represent piffling sums in comparison with other items of revenue where millions and billions of pounds escape us. Under this provision, civil servants will be checking on VAT returns from caravan sites. The amounts may not be piffling in the sense of being pennies, pounds or hundreds of pounds, but they will be small beer that will involve a great deal of extra bureaucracy and administration for very little effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced by the Economic Secretary's argument that caravan site owners will have to change their electricity meters, double up on them, and ensure that the electricity for a swimming pool is not mixed up with the electricity for individual caravans. I welcome the provision, in that caravan owners would otherwise have had to pay VAT on everything. But at the end of the day everything, including the cables and the administration, will cost extra and that cost will be passed on to caravan owners who have caravans on site parks.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 153, line 38, leave out sub-paragraph (k).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is partly probing. It deals with what may happen if a developer builds an estate and leaves a recreational area for the benefit of the estate. If VAT was to be charged on those recreational facilities, it would be a bit of disincentive for a developer to include recreational areas or areas for community use when building an estate. Of course, if the estate was a domestic dwelling, it would be zero-rated. Will the Minister explain what the position is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subparagraph (k) has been carried over from the existing law, in which it has featured since 1986. However, the change in 1986 did no more than restore the practical interpretation of the law—following a decision of the VAT tribunal—to what it had been since the beginning of the tax in 1973. Were the amendment passed, we should be altering the way that VAT has been applied since its inception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision has the effect of making the granting of facilities for playing a sport or participating in physical recreation taxable where it would otherwise be exempt as a licence to occupy land. Also carried over from the current tax are the provisions of note (13), which disapply paragraph (k) where the grant is for periods of more than a day, or for regular use by a school or club. If the amendment were accepted, grants of sports facilities would become generally exempt, although in theory the owner of the sport facility would be entitled to exercise the option to tax with effect from 1 August 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxation of sporting and physical recreation facilities is in line with both the treatment of entertainment and other recreation facilities generally and broader fiscal policy. Although exemption would mean that users were not required to pay tax, it would also carry with it the disadvantages of restricted input tax deduction and administrative complications for traders supplying the facilities, which would have to be reflected in their charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that there is a case for having zero-rating on that set of items. It does not go against the sixth VAT directive, as it is of immediate benefit to the consumer and exists for a social purpose. I suspect that, as there is already VAT on those items, it will not be easy to zero rate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have made the point and we must progress. I hope that the Economic Secretary has heard what I have said and, in those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"but excluding any relevant residential or charitable interest".</p></q>
The intention of the amendment is clear—any assignment or transaction, or surrender of a lease back to the landlord by anyone using a building as a dwelling, should not be standard-rated. Similarly, anyone using a building for a relevant charitable purpose should not be charged VAT if and when the lease reverts to the landlord. The wording of the amendment is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 38 of VAT notice 742 says that
	<br><q><p>"From 1 April 1989, the 'surrender', for a consideration, of any interest in or right over land, or of any licence to occupy land, is standard-rated. Similarly the assignment of any interest, etc, back to a lessor or licensor, by the lessee or licensee is also standard-rated."</p></q>
The important sentence is:
	<br><q><p>"The surrender of a lease or licence of domestic accommodation by a tenant is unlikely to be in the course of furtherance of a business and therefore is unlikely to be subject to VAT."</p></q>
I am the first to admit that my reading of such measures may not be accurate, but I should have thought that the amendment would make the position a little clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in that what his amendment sets out to achieve is already the case. Therefore, there is no issue between us, merely a question of whether clarification is needed. A person renting property for a relevant charitable purpose must, by definition, be using it for a non-business purpose. That means that the surrender, or assignment back to the landlord, of that interest, even if the landlord pays for it, cannot be a business transaction by charity. Tax will not, therefore, have to be charged by the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, surrenders of leasehold interests in dwellings will not normally be in the course of a business. They, too, will not be taxable. The only case in which taxation might arise is for relevant residential purposes, for example where people living in communal residential accommodation choose to surrender the lease back to the landlord, but that is covered by the amendment. If the landlord intended to continue the same operation, he would not normally make payment. If he was buying the property back to redevelop it for another business activity, he could claim back the tax that he had to pay on surrender against the business activities in which he was engaged. Although I recognise the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For one horrible moment I thought that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that those interventions on other matters have been helpful to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), but we must proceed with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If buildings or civil engineering works are not new for the purposes of the three-year rule, should not a period of time have been allocated to a developer or owner who has just constructed a building with the intention of completing or selling it before 1 April 1989 but not having it occupied or finishing the civil engineering work before then? I should have thought that two or three months' grace, or at least notice of the Government's intentions, would have been fairer so that builders or developers who wanted to recover their inputs would have known that they had to complete the work and occupy the building by that particular date. Later amendments deal with developers leasing the building before they sell it, which involves a large element of inequity in that input tax will be lost. But, when developers intend to sell, and have constructed and completed the building before 1 April, but have not occupied it, that gives rise to delay in recovering input VAT. The Government should allow recovery of the input immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not so much one of retrospection as of a straight conflict of interests between the developers and the buyers of their buildings, which do not necessarily coincide in the transitional period between 1 April and 1 August. The new regime for property development involves the concept of taxing buildings when they are new. We decided that it was unrealistic to have a single date when a building was either new or not new. That would have been simplistic in relation to large commercial buildings, which often come into occupation over a period of months or even years. We decided to have a three-year period during which a building was new and therefore liable to tax when sold freehold. The three-year period reckons from the date on which the architect issues a certificate of practical completion or the date of full occupation, whichever happens first. The certificate of practical completion is normally issued when the building is structurally complete, but remains to be fitted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the three-year rule is perfectly satisfactory for the future, it gives rise to problems in relation to the start of the new regime from 1 April 1989. Developers wanted to be able to tax their sales of the new buildings before the option for taxation became available on 1 August 1989 so that they could recover tax on their remaining construction costs, professional fees, and so on. However, some of their exempt clients did not want to have to bear the tax or to fund it until they could deduct it as input tax after exercising their option to tax after 1 August. Note (6) is the compromise between those two positions. It provides for exemption where the building has been fully occupied before that date, exemption for when the building has already been sold before that date but for taxation of the initial sale where the building was not fully occupied before 1 April 1989. Clearly that does not please everbody, but I believe that it is the best available solution to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
a rather intractable problem. Note (6) should therefore be retained and not removed as the amendment proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to quote another paragraph from VAT notice 742:
	<br><q><p>"All freehold sales within the 3 year period are standard-rated. Buildings or civil engineering works completed before 1 April 1989 are not 'new' for the purposes of the 3-year rule. But the first freehold sale is standard-rated if it takes place on or after 1 April 1989 and the building was not fully occupied, or the civil engineering work not fully used, before that date."</p></q>
It now fits into place that a developer or builder might be intending to sell and might have completed the building, but if it is not fully occupied, it will be standard-rated. That is how the element of retrospection comes into the legislation. Buildings take time to construct, to finish, to let and to be occupied. The Finance Bill was not pubished until 10 or 11 April. I am not sure whether the industry knew at the time what would be proposed in the Bill. But it is unfair for a Bill to be published 10 days after the relevant period has ended. There are developers who have undertaken commitments to develop and are in the process of getting the buildings occupied. They would have got the buildings occupied so that they would not be standard-rated were it not for the fact that 10 days after the deadline, the Government published the Finance Bill and there was the question of retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a balance of arguments, it should be in favour of the person who has made commitments before the publication of the Finance Bill. Of course, now that we have the new regime, developers and lessees know where they are. Any building that will not be used for a zero-rated purpose should attract VAT. We do not disagree with that. I understand the Economic Secretary's point that there is an element of difficulty in how it is done, but it is a bit unfair on the person who has made previous commitments. That is the reason for the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this amendment will be clearer. It is also a probing amendment, which deals with buildings that are zero-rated because that is the developer's intention, and after the building is let or occupied, the use to which it is put changes and it becomes VATable. Under the Bill, no VAT will be charged to the original builder if such an event takes place more than 10 years from the date of the building's occupation. Will the arbitrary cut-off point of 10 years produce some distortions in the building market when that period is up? Although after eight and a half, nine, or nine and a half years a change in the use of a building may be reasonable or even desirable, the fact that it would attract VAT if it were made before the 10 years were up would mean a distortion simply because of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment simply says that the rate should be pro rata, going down from 10 years to one and taking 10 per cent. off the VAT payable for every year. That may not be a sensible idea, either. Perhaps an amendment should insist on full VAT being payable for a period of years—five, seven or 10 years, say—and then there should be a sliding scale of discounts so that VAT should be applied in full for the first X years. Then for year X plus one it should be perhaps 80 per cent. of what it would be in the first X years, in year X plus two, 60 per cent., in X plus three, 40 per cent. and so on, till we get down to zero. I wonder whether an amendment along those lines would improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of paragraph 1 of the new schedule 6A to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 is to claw back tax on buildings which have been zero-rated by reason of their being used for qualifying purposes, the purposes of certain residential accommodation or of non-business charity operations, which cease to be so used within a period of 10 years. There clearly has to be such a clawback provision to prevent easy avoidance. But there may—fairly rarely I would imagine—be other cases where innocent changes of use, or changes of ownership, take place within the 10-year period, and in fairness to other taxpayers who are now losing zero-rating on their new construction there should be a liability to VAT on the change of use, whether it be contrived or uncontrived, to non-qualifying purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
The paragraph falls into two halves. The first half—subparagraphs (2) and (3)—deals with a case where the previously zero-rated building is sold or let. Here tax will be chargeable on the sale or letting on the basis of the full selling or letting price. The hon. Member for Wrexham has said that this is unfair if the building has in fact been used for qualifying purposes for several years. However, not only will it be more straightforward to require tax to be based on the actual prices realised, but, more importantly, the buildings will be competing in a largely taxed commercial property market—at any rate for buildings of that vintage—and it is entirely reasonable that they should re-enter that market on a fully taxed basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraphs (4) and (6) deal with changes of use by the owning organisation—say a residential nursing home becoming a short-term convalescent home, or a charity taking over part of a non-business building for business purposes. Here there is no current transaction on which to base any VAT charge, so a self-supply is deemed to exist and the VAT payable will be equal to the amount that would have been payable if the building had not originally been zero-rated. Under both halves of the paragraph, no VAT will actually be payable unless the residential home proprietor or charity is registered for VAT or, as a result of making the supplies under this paragraph, becomes registrable. Therefore many minor changes of use will be effectively ignored in practice. Where a building, or part of a building, used originally entirely for non-business purposes becomes used for business purposes for up to 10 per cent. of total use, Customs will ignore that degree of business use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to amend only subparagraph (6) so that the amount of tax that would have been payable had not the building originally been zero-rated is split between the periods of qualifying and non-qualifying use in the overall 10-year period. If the building was used for qualifying purposes for five years and then used for non-qualifying purposes, only half the tax that would originally have been charged becomes chargeable. It would be unfair to allow a charity or residential home owner to retain, in effect, an element of zero-rating for a building which is no longer being used for a qualifying purpose. To do so would make such persons better off than a non-qualifying person who has to operate in what will be a largely taxed property market. New buildings will be compulsorily taxed in the first three years of their life and thereafter the majority of vendors and landlords may opt to tax them. If the charity or residential home owner sells or lets the building he is accountable for tax on the full selling price under subparagraphs (2) and (3) and there is no reason for change of use to be dealt with on a markedly more favourable basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is, the charity or residential home owner gets an advantage through only having to pay VAT based on the original cost of the building rather than on current value. I am not, therefore, satisfied that any change on the lines suggested in amendments Nos. 102 and 103 is justified. These provisions should not be made too complex. We want a relatively simple concept which can be easily put over to those claiming the charity and residential buildings relief:

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
that valuable relief is made available to them but that it is only a conditional relief for a period of 10 years. If there is a change of use during that period they have to pay tax on the price they get for the building if they sell it or the price they paid for it if they are simply changing to a non-qualifying use. It is better to leave that system in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with much of what the Economic Secretary has said. There is no intention of giving relief to people too quickly after a building has been brought into use. I just wonder whether the absolute cut-off after 10 years will produce distortions and abuses in the use to which buildings are put. The amendment is not complicated. I said initially that it is probably not the right one. We suggest that no relief should be given for a certain number of years, be it 10, seven or five, but perhaps there should have been a sliding scale to smooth out the abrupt change so that after a certain period those provisions do not apply.

Paragraph 7 of schedule 7 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 says that records will be kept for only six years. If records are to be kept for only six years but this provision will continue for 10 years, will that not cause problems in years six to 10 and onwards after the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly a case for having no 10-year limit and for saying that whenever a change of use takes place following a non-qualifying use there should be clawback. But that would certainly lead to record-keeping problems if it were infinite. Ten years is perhaps an arbitary period. It ties up with the timescale that exists for other rules, including the treatment of capital assets and impartial exemption cases. It is not an inappropriate period to have. Building owners will obviously be expected to keep records for such an important item as the capital costs of a building and can be reasonably expected to have them for 10 years, even if they are not legally obliged to keep all their detailed tax records for other minor transactions for more than six years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This series of amendments is needed to ensure that the exercise of the option to tax in relation to buildings and land cannot be exploited by using the VAT group rules to enable an exempt or partly exempt business to obtain a tax-free building for its own use when in other circumstances it would not be able to recover the full amount of VAT charged on purchase, repair, maintenance and refurbishment costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The text as currently drafted could be exploited as illustrated in the following example. A landlord within a VAT group opts to tax rents to a tenant outside the group. The landlord can therefore recover all the VAT he has incurred on the purchase, repair or refurbishment of the building, and the building does not carry any "sticking" tax. The tenant could be a bank, which is partly exempt for VAT and cannot recover all the VAT it incurs on its purchases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The landlord then sells the building to another person within the VAT group. Under normal VAT rules all supplies within a group are disregarded, and no tax is chargeable. The new landlord leaves the VAT group with his tax-free building, and does not opt to tax the rentals to the tenant—the bank. The tenant is therefore able to obtain the benefit of a completely tax-free building, whereas he would not normally be able to do so, and a competitor who had simply rented a building from a person who had opted to tax his rents would not have been able to recover all the tax charged to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To prevent that form of tax avoidance and distortion of competition, the proposed amendments extend the conditions of the option to tax so that where it has been exercised in relation to any building or land by a body corporate it also applies to any other body corporate in the same VAT group or which joins or leaves the group. That is achieved by introducing the concept of a relevant associate to a body corporate—defined in the new subparagraph (5) of paragraph 3—on whom the option to tax in relation to a particular building or land is also being binding.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although these amendments are grouped together, two issues are involved. I hope that we shall be able to separate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 105 changes the proposal that the option to tax is solely the landlord's option. It is an important issue, which involves a matter of principle. As a result of last year's infraction proceedings, the Government will give landlords of commercial premises the power and the right, irrespective of the wishes of the tenant, to take the option to tax the tenancy or lease that the tenant has. In some countries in Europe, the option is taken on a joint basis and it can be carried out only if the tenant agrees. I agree that that would give the tenant the power of veto, but, as it stands, the Bill gives the tenant no say in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
whether he or she is taxed as a result of the provisions. That prerogative lies entirely with the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the proposal is that one section of the business community should unilaterally decide whether another section should be taxed. If the taxpayer makes wholly taxable supplies, that will not matter. But if he makes some exempt supplies, it will matter a great deal. It is an unprecedented delegation of Parliament's power over taxation. It will allow other people to decide whether others should be taxed. The Economic Secretary must justify why one taxpayer can determine the tax status of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no guarantee that the tenant's additional outflows will benefit the Exchequer. Armed with this statutory power, a landlord could force a tenant to pay a higher rent under the threat of opting for tax if the tenant did not pay the increase. The impact of the measure is not clear to me and both sides of the Committee would like to hear what will happen. Assurances that landlords will not act in that way will be taken at their worth. No doubt landlords with integrity will try to apply the measure properly. Other landlords will say to their business tenants—and we are considering all types of business, not just the exempt sector, such as banks, which can find money by increasing their customers' charges—that the tax should be imposed. That will make it difficult for those businesses to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good case for the option to tax to be shared between both parties. Perhaps the Government will insist that the landlord has the final say, but the tenants should be allowed at least to question the landlord's decision. If they cannot question the decision, the option to tax should be examined by an independent arbitrator or by some other means, to assess whether the landlord's decision is fair and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 105 says:
	<br><q><p>"Any building or land over which any person has an interest or a right to occupy, unless the agreement of that person is obtained beforehand."</p></q>
Before I move away from the amendment, I must again point out that it will give the tenant a veto. I am not insisting that the amendment be applied in the way that it is tabled because it is not the Opposition's job to formulate cast-iron, legally drafted amendments that pass the scrutiny of parliamentary draftsmen. But the intention is clear: tenants should be given more rights than they have under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 109 and 111 deal with other matters. I can see why the two amendments are related, although they deal with separate issues. The difficulty arises in deciding what is, and what is not, a building. Hon. Members can think of all sorts of buildings and complexes that may be joined by a covered walkway. If they are, they are regarded as the same building, according to the schedule, and an election must be made—if it is to be made—as if the buildings were one building. However, that is a little silly, because covered walkways could be covered one day, uncovered the next and on the third day be covered again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a builder develops a precinct, it can be comprised of many individual shops, but there are precincts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
in the United Kingdom that are managed by one company. Although individual lessees may operate in such a precinct, any reasonable person would regard it as one entity and one shop. But there are also precincts, shopping arcades and centres in the United Kingdom where that is not the case: units stand alone and may not have one management company to look after common services. In such a case, individual options to tax should be allowed, because those shops and precincts cannot be regarded as one entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether there is a walkway between two buildings is entirely artificial. If there is an uncovered walkway, buildings are regarded as separate, but if the walkway is covered, the two buildings are regarded as one. That is one of the weaker parts of the Bill and I hope that we can get the Economic Secretary to focus his mind on the problem to see whether the provision can be drafted in a better way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My humble amendment No. 17 refers to the cumbersomely-named election to waive an exemption for the purposes of value added tax. As we have heard in the lucid remarks of the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), election can be made in respect of separate buildings for landlords of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
But agricultural landlords are treated differently. Paragraph (3)(2)(b) of the proposed schedule 6A to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 states that all agricultural land in which the person making an election has an interest shall be treated as a single unit. If an agricultural landlord has two, three or four farms he must elect to waive the option in respect of all of them; he cannot distinguish between them. That is unduly restrictive and my opinion is shared by the Institute of Taxation. I am sure that all members of the Committee have received a copy of its brief which states that if the restrictions were to be eliminated
	<br><q><p>"we do not consider that the administration of the tax would be seriously affected."</p></q>
The restriction will be a serious impediment to the achievement of the Government's objectives in relation to agricultural landlords. The purpose of the election to waive an exemption is to enable taxpayers to recover their input tax. An agricultural landlord may wish to elect to waive his exemption in respect of one but not all of his farms because of the possible effect on his tenants. If among his tenants there are private individuals who are not registered for VAT because it is not worth their while, the landlord will have to impose a burden on them to recover his input tax in one area. Therefore, the restriction would be to the detriment of small businesses, and agricultural landowners should not be singled out for the all-or-nothing treatment but should be treated on all fours with commercial landowners who can decide which buildings come within the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
If my amendment is not accepted in its current form, it would be better to distinguish between farms. The objection of my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to my amendment is that a farmer could add or subtract fields to a farm unit, but I do not believe that farmers operate in that way. If it were done on a farm-by-farm basis it would meet the objection that I anticipate from my hon. Friend. I hope that he will be as reasonable as he always tries to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton). We should deal with any pressures here and elsewhere in the Bill that would make it less attractive to agricultural landlords to let their land or give them a less satisfactory return if they do. We should also deal with the fact that in certain cases there may be differential treatment vis-à-vis tenants because of the need for a uniform, universal exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already a structure whereby individual farming units are separately identified under agricultural holding numbers. In principle, it would be possible to confine the exemption to the units that are separately identified at the date of the enforcement of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The option to tax is an unusual facility, as the hon. Member for Wrexham pointed out. However, it is a crucial aspect of the way in which we have tried to minimise the burden of the unwelcome judgment on the business community and the construction industry in paticular. It benefits almost everybody except the exempt business community and, of course, charitable bodies, which we have tried to relieve by other means. We considered whether the option to tax should be at the behest of the landlord or the tenant or jointly. The hon. Gentleman rightly recognised that a joint option is a tenant's veto so the choice is between the landlord and the tenant. We decided against giving the veto to the tenant not just because there are as many objections to giving it exclusively to the tenant as there are to giving it to the landlord, but because it could create great complexities, the opportunity for fraud and greater problems of enforcing compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A multi-tenanted building, whose tenants had the option of deciding whether tax would be borne on their rents, would create great problems for landlords in tracing which parts of the building had the option exercised and which had not. How the burden of charges made for VAT on refurbishment and other costs associated with the communal parts of the building were allocated among different tenants, some of whom opted to be taxed while others did not, would create grave problems. Taking those considerations into account, and recognising that essentially we are dealing with the financial sector—which normally does not receive the warm feelings from the Opposition that their amendments implicitly give them—we thought it appropriate to give the option to the landlord. We recognise that the landlord normally will consult the tenants before exercising that option, but we could not think of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
way of enshrining that in law without transferring the option to a tenant's veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Wrexham pointed out that other countries have given the option jointly to landlords and tenants, only the Netherlands has attempted to operate such a system. Other countries have considered it appropriate to take the action that we propose. The hon. Gentleman suggested that that gives landlords the opportunity to blackmail their tenants by saying that if the tenants do not give them a higher rent, they will apply VAT to the existing rent. The classic answer to the blackmailer is, of course, "No", it is, perhaps, not the best solution to give tenants the right to create problems for their landlords, but, in any case, most leases have periodic reassessments, which we are phasing in so that the full impact of the option to tax will not hit all tenants in the first year. We believe that we have chosen the most practical, least complex route that will give rise to the least avoidance problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 117 my hon. Friends the Members for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) raised the question of agricultural land. There was no pressing need to make the option for tax rent available for agricultural land. Most respondents to the consultation document who expressed a view on the point were in favour. We concluded that as the withdrawal of zero-rating from non-domestic construction and fuel and power would increase the non-recoverable VAT incurred by agricultural landlords if their lettings remained exempt we would extend the option to tax to them. However, we did not want to concede a transaction by transaction basis. That would have undermined our position on buildings. A farm-by-farm basis, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton suggested, would on first consideration appear to be the equivalent of the building-by-building basis, nevertheless has considerable disadvantages in practice. Individual buildings once erected normally retain their separate identity. Individual farms have no permanent identity—they generally have no artificial or natural limits to their size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fields are frequently sold, added, or taken away from existing holdings. Smaller farms are merged and lose their separate identities to larger ones. Landowners regularly vary the acreage farmed under one tenancy or kept under their own operations. It would be soon impossible to keep track of which fields and which parts of farms an owner had opted for and which he had not. VAT officers visiting agricultural landowners would have to spend hours scrutinising estate or ordnance survey maps trying to establish which land had been the subject of a valid option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only did we have to take into account all those difficulties, but we have had to ask why landlords needed to opt for some farms and not for others. Agricultural tenants are generally registered, or entitled to be registered, for tax if they so wish. That is more clearly the case here than for buildings. There are few, if any, exempt tenants who cannot recover the VAT charged by the landlords as their input tax. We concluded that the option for agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
land would have to be exercised on an all-or-nothing basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must advise the Committee not to accept the amendment because, in addition to the general difficulties that I have described, the amendment would allow several options to be exercised for individual fields—or small corners of individual fields—and that would be unmanageable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary did not answer my question on walkways. I understand that there could be problems in a multi-tenanted building, such as markets in a market hall, where different traders come and go.

To get round the legislation, builders may decide to construct uncovered, rather than covered, walkways. That would be nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But where a single owner owns a whole shopping centre, he should, for the same reasons that apply to a single building, opt all or nothing for the whole complex. The same arguments that I deployed on individual buildings will apply to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 deletes paragraph 2(4). Paragraph 2(4)(a) appears to mean that input tax will be prevented from being recovered before an election to waive exemption is made under paragraph 2(1) and before it takes effect if, before the election is made, exempt supplies were made, even though they may have been supplied before the date when the input tax was incurred. That does not seem to be right. Although I admit that the amendment is defective, it has been tabled to elicit an answer from the Economic Secretary and to see whether the Opposition's understanding of the position is correct. If so, it should be redressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 107 seeks to avoid an anomaly on the recovery on input tax. Until now, on the surrender of a lease, where the interest surrendered

is then the subject of a grant of a short lease, it is exempt. That will change, but it is anomalous to include zero-rated items under items 1 or 2 of group 8 of schedule 5 to the Value Added Tax Act 1983 to allow inputs and not exemptions to be recovered under item 1 of group 1 of schedule 6. That is a clear-cut anomaly and I hope that the Economic Secretary can help the Committee.

Amendment No. 108 omits paragraph 2(6)(b), which states:

Although the Bill relaxes the recoverability of inputs in the period from April to July, there are still some problems. For example, if a building is completed but not fully occupied until after 1 April 1989 and is sold on 31 May 1989, tax is charged on the sale. If the purchaser then sells the building before 31 August 1989, the second sale will be exempt. However, the first purchaser will not have an interest in the building on 1 August 1989 and will not have an option to tax on that day as required by paragraph 2(6)(b) and (c). The purchaser will not be able to recover his input tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my understanding is correct, that is an anomaly. I hope that the Economic Secretary will either tell me that I am right and that something will be done or explain why my understanding of the measure is imperfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find some of what the hon. Gentleman said to be perceptive, but I must take issue with him on some points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Option to tax is a valuable relief and because of that we require safeguards against abuse. Paragraphs 2(3) to 2(6) have to be looked at together to understand their true effect. Paragraph 2(3) says that in principle a person cannot recover input tax until the option to tax his outputs has effect. Paragraphs 2(4) says that once the option has effect, one can recover as input tax, the tax already incurred if one has not previously made exempt supplies in respect of the building concerned. If exempt supplies were made, they would have been zero-rated supplies but for the loss of zero-rating from 1 April 1989. Striking out subparagraph (4) will, therefore, do considerable damage to developers and landlords in that it will prevent them from receiving retrospective input tax once they have exercised their options. From what he said, I do not think that that was the hon. Gentleman's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(5) will prevent the right to retrospective recovery of input tax going back before 1 August 1989 except to protect the position of developers who had, under the old VAT regime, an expectation of receiving input tax recovery because they were engaged on new build projects rather than refurbishments. Paragraph 2(6) will give retrospective recovery to people who acquired a new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
building, or were having one built, in the period 1 April to 31 July 1989 and who immediately let it on exempt supplies and then opted to tax from 1 August 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, amendment No. 106 would destroy an important feature of the option; that is to say, once one has opted one can then recover input tax retrospectively. I can accept amendment No. 107 because it will cover the possibility of landlords who acquired their new building from someone other than the developer being treated in the same way as if they had acquired it from the developer or had had a contractor build it for them. I can also accept amendment No. 108. It will allow anyone who acquires a new building in the period 1 April to 31 July 1989 to recover input tax on the acquisition cost provided that he opts to tax his lettings or sale of the building after that date and that he uses the building for taxable activities. The restriction imposed by paragraph 2(6)(b) is unnecessarily strict. It would prevent the landlord who did not succeed in letting his building by 31 July 1989 from receiving recovery of the input tax incurred on his new building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I advise the Committee to reject amendment No. 106, but to accept amendment Nos 107 and 108.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A new option is available to any developer if a building, upon which an option to tax has been exercised, is demolished. I hope that my understanding of that part of the legislation is right.

I am worried about listed buildings where a facade is to be kept for conservation or environmental reasons. Section 6 of paragraph 17 of VAT leaflet 708/2/89 says:
	<br><q><p>"Where the demolition of a building or civil engineering works is zero-rated as being in course of the construction of a dwelling or other qualifying building or work. This includes demolition down to: ground level but leaving foundations a single facade wall".</p></q>
I hoped that the spirit of that paragraph could have been carried over to the Bill, and for a new option to be available. I am not sure what would happen to buildings with environmental or conservation merit, but I would be worried if a developer destroyed a building whose facade he would otherwise have conserved, because he wanted a new option. The building might not be a listed building where consent has to be obtained, although listed building consent is easier to obtain in some local authorities than in others. We should not leave local authorities to preserve our listed buildings; we should do everything possible to conserve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 112 is a helpful amendment. Paragraph 17 from the VAT leaflet is not strictly applicable, but the spirit of it should be carried over to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 159 was starred on Tuesday but is not starred today. It seeks to insert the words,
	<br><q><p>"except where a reconstruction, enlargement or extension of, or the provision of an annex to, an existing building which increases the total floor area of the building by at least 20 per cent."</p></q>
That takes cognisance of Government amendment No. 71. We have changed 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. because, before any new option is allowed, there should be a substantial addition to or reconstruction of a building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I realise that that could lead to avoidance, and I shall not press the amendment if it will create avoidance or administrative difficulties. But I am worried about buildings of architectural merit being completely demolished so that a new option may be exercised. I hope that the Economic Secretary will relax that provision a little, so that our historic and architectural heritage may be saved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot be as helpful as I was with the previous two amendments. Where there is a building, the option to tax is in respect of that building. If the building is totally demolished, that option can no longer apply to it. The hon. Gentleman may think, however, that the option for the totally demolished building carried over to any replacement building on the same site, but that is not so. The letting of the new building would not have to be taxed because the option was exercised for the previous building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, the hon. Gentleman may think that the option exercised for a building which has been totally demolished applies thereafter, to the site on which it stood. That is not so either. As the option was for the building—on its site—if the building is totally demolished the option disappears with the building: it does not attach to the site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That part of the amendment appears, therefore, to be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
As for major reconstructions of listed buildings, the aim seems to be to allow the option to tax to be rescinded where the building is a listed building and there has been a major reconstruction of it. If the option had been exercised before the reconstruction began, that would allow recovery of all the input tax incurred on the major reconstruction. The owner would then have a tax-free building. If he were then allowed to revoke the option, he could supply the building on an exempt basis. The amendment therefore strikes at one of the basic principles of the option, that someone getting input tax relief must commit himself to taxing his subsequent lettings or sale of the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I reassure the hon. Gentleman—it is not part of VAT law—that if a building is listed or is in a conservation area it cannot lawfully be demolished without the approval of the planning authority, or an appeal to the Secretary of State for the Environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that listed building consent is required. But the critical question that I sought to ask was whether there would be an increase in the total demolition of buildings of architectural merit, which may not be listed or in conservation areas, simply because a new option would be granted. If one facade of such a building were left, that is hardly giving away vast quantities of tax from the exercise. Moreover, most people would support such a measure. If the Economic Secretary cannot give me a comprehensive answer, will he take it away and consider whether such a measure could be allowed within the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government amendments Nos. 72 to 79.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The need for this amendment arises because the European Commission had not felt able to endorse the derogation which the Government sought under article 27 of the sixth VAT directive. This derogation would have permitted the VAT treatment of building land set out in the original paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may ask why we should have wanted to apply VAT to building land at all since the European Court judgment did not deal with it. Building land has never been zero-rated in the UK, so the European Court had nothing to say on the matter. Under the sixth VAT directive, articles 4.3(b) and 13B(h), a supply of building land is required to be taxed, but in the past we have taken advantage of a transitional derogation under which building land can be exempted—Article 28.3(b), annex F, item No. 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exemption made sense when new buildings were zero-rated, but once we had been required by the European Court judgment to tax new, non-domestic buildings it would not have been sensible to continue with the building land exemption for this category of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
building. This is because retaining an exemption for the largest cost element—or second largest after labour—in the overall cost of a new building would have introduced a gross distortion in the market place. It would have introduced a massive fiscal incentive in favour of self-developments and against buying from a developer or renting from a landlord. When a building is bought or leased, the price or rent paid reflects the open market value of the building including the land on which it stands. People buying or renting accommodation would be paying VAT on the full price or rent charged. By contrast, if they could go out and acquire the land for their new accommodation before a brick had been laid upon it, they would pay no VAT on the land and thus bear VAT only on the cost of construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally at the time of the European Court judgment last June when the consultation paper was issued, we hoped it would be possible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of building land, bearing in mind in particular that we did not want to apply VAT to what became land for housing. However, the longer the consultation exercise progressed, the more we became convinced that taxing actual sales of building land, however defined, was not the answer. On the one hand, if land assumed the status of building land only after planning permission was obtained, land acquired before planning permission would escape VAT. We would, indeed, be introducing a fiscal incentive to get land for development before obtaining planning permission. Thus the distortion in favour of self-development would still be there. The same thing would happen when buildings were obtained with a view to demolition and redevelopment. At the time the buildings were acquired, the vendor would not know for certain whether redevelopment would be permitted and he could not be said to be making a supply of building land. A similar problem would arise in respect of building land for housing which we wanted to remain exempt. How would a vendor know whether land he was selling was going to be used for offices or other commercial buildings, or for houses, or for a mixture of the two? Even if there were a valid planning permission extant, this could have been revoked or amended before development actually commenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore devised the scheme which features in paragraphs 5 and 6 of schedule 6A in the Bill as it stands before the Committee. The essence of this scheme—described by one prominent VAT expert as ingenious—applies VAT at the time construction starts on a self-supply basis. By then it must be beyond all doubt that the land is building land and equally it will be beyond all doubt what is the nature of the building under construction. If it is a dwelling or other building qualifying for the zero rate, no VAT would be charged. If not, the land would be chargeable in principle. In practice, however, if the building was going to be sold or let on a taxable basis when completed, VAT on the self-supply would not be chargeable because the Exchequer would eventually receive the VAT when the building was sold or let. Similarly, if the person constructing the building was going to remain fully taxable, he would always be entitled to deduct any VAT that was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
charged, and so in the particular circumstances there seemed no need to put him through the self-supply procedure unnecessarily, involving the not always easy task of applying open market valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I published the draft legislation on 6 February, I made clear that the building land scheme was dependent on getting a derogation from Brussels. We did not anticipate any particular problems with it since we were not asking to collect a penny less in tax than was required under the Sixth directive. We were asking for a scheme which targeted those areas where tax needed to be collected to comply with the spirit of the European Court of Justice judgment and apply VAT to new non-domestic construction and property development in an effective way. At the same time we were legally entitled to retain the derogation for building land and did not want to tax building land for housing. However, the Commission, while not disagreeing with our objective, claimed we were departing too far from the general structure of the tax provided for in the Sixth directive, and it became clear to us that, without the Commission's support, our derogation request could not succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy behind the new scheme is generally the same as that behind the old one. If we are going to apply VAT to non-domestic construction and property development—as indeed we must because of our Treaty obligations—we should do so in an effective manner, providing a level playing field and preventing distortions and easy avoidance. In some ways the new scheme is more radical than the old one. Instead of tackling the building land problem directly, the new one focusses on the effective taxation of all non-domestic buildings at the time they are ready to go into consumption. The special self-supply charge provided in the new paragraphs 5–7 will ensure that any building which is not let or sold on a taxable basis will be taxed if the developer uses it for an exempt purpose within a period of 10 years from when it was completed. This special charge is within the terms of Article 5.7(a) of the Sixth directive and the only point on which we need a derogation is to apply an open market value to that self-supply instead of cost. On this the Commission has agreed that we can amend our earlier derogation accordingly and, provided that no other member states objects—and they have no reason to—the Commission will support our request. We hope that the formalities should be completed within the next two or three weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the taxpayer's point of view the new scheme will be undoubtedly less complicated than the earlier one and less uncertain. He will not have to make, at the beginning of construction, a declaration about selling the building. He will not have to make a premature election to tax the rents if he plans to let the building. He will not have to find the VAT on the building land from the beginning of construction. Because the building will always be used to make either taxable supplies or will generate the taxable self-supply charge, all the VAT incurred by the developer during the construction process will be recoverable as input tax. This will be a considerable cash flow benefit compared with the old scheme.

The new scheme like the old one will only affect buildings whose construction commences on or after 1 August 1989. It will not apply to buildings entitled to retain zero rating under the transitional relief provided for in paragraph 12 of schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about all the points in the amendment. It is a pity that the Government tabled this massive amendment of Friday, when all of us had gone home. None of us had a chance to read it till the next week. I compiled my notes for the Bill before the amendment was tabled, so it caused me some consternation. I suspect that we can give only an imperfect consideration to the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one advantage of the Committee stage is that there will be a Report stage. I hope, Mr. Crowther, that you will not seek to have Mr. Speaker rule out any amendments that we may table on Report, even though we may not have had sufficient time to consider them. It is a problem that we sometimes encounter. We have to look at legislation but sometimes we cannot give it proper consideration. I hope that we can perhaps do so later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Speaker takes note of what happens here, but he is not influenced by Chairmen of Standing Committees and they make no attempt to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Crowther. In that case I hope that Mr. Speaker does cast his eye on what has just been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make progress because we have many amendments to consider. I do not intend to speak to every amendment in the group because if I did I would have to continue my speech after the dinner break and I do not want to do that. I have made some amendments to the Opposition's original amendment. Amendment No. 113 should therefore be read in conjunction with amendment (b) to Government amendment No. 71 which seeks to insert the following words:
	<br><q><p>"except for where the works under sub-paragraph 5(1)(a) or 5(1)(b) above relate to a rebuilding obligation in the case of flood, fire or other circumstances beyond the owner's control".</p></q>
That was the intention of amendment No. 113. The problem is that unless the purchaser or the developer makes the appropriate declarations in paragraphs 5(5)(a), (b) or (c)—it is probably changed in Government amendment No. 71 self-supply rules will be applied on the open market value. It seems slightly unfair that if the building burns down the land is still there and has not lost value, but for the rebuilding contract, which is outside the developer's control, VAT is charged on the whole of the market value, including the land. Could not some way have been found in framing these rules to charge VAT on the rebuilding part of the obligation rather than on all the obligation including the land? I hope that I get some support from Conservative Back Benchers here. Something ought to have been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 115 and 116 have been surperseded, but pehaps the Economic Secretary will tell me whether the point that I was trying to make
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
in those amendments has been taken into account in the Government amendment. If he cannot tell me that tonight perhaps he can write to me so that we can come back to it on Report. I do not expect anyone here to be able to give instant answers to many of these matters. Under existing legislation, particularly schedule 5, group 8, any intending trader is allowed to recover input VAT incurred on preliminary expenditure relating to a proposed construction in anticipation of making a zero-rated supply. The present draft—at least before Government amendment No. 71 was tabled—prohibits the recovery of input VAT until the relevant interest is acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem here is that many developers develop land with fairly tight cashflows and margins. A delay in the recovery of the input could prejudice some schemes. In some towns a development may not go ahead. Small amount though it is, VAT is crucial to the final decision. If the intention is to construct is there not some way for him to recover his inputs any earlier? How will a developer get back his pre-acquisition input if he subsequently acquires and opts to tax? I think that he can do it, but at best there will be a considerable delay before it can be done. There should be an assurance that it can be done, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will confirm that there will not be too long a delay before it can be done.

Amendment No. 119 is superseded by Opposition amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 71. At the end of paragraph 5(1)(a), "or" is deleted and our amendment (a) inserts:
	<br><q><p>"except where he intends to make a taxable supply under sub-paragraph 5(3)(b) below".</p></q>
This important amendment deals with a situation where someone develops, does not exercise an option to tax but files a declaration to sell and in the meantime rents to exempt tenants. Assuming that he sells within three years, he cannot—as I read it—recover his input VAT although he has to pay output VAT. I do not know whether that has been superseded by Government amendment No. 71—I do not think that it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a developer does not have a "relevant interest" as defined in subparagraph (4) on page 159, line 41, he will not be able to recover any input VAT incurred during construction, and he will not be able to recover input VAT on the self-supply of the land on which he is developing. However, he will be obliged to standard rate the freehold supply if it is a new building and if it is sold within three years of completion. Inputs are disallowed and outputs have to be paid. There seems to be an inequity in that and I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary cast some light upon the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I often think that these Committees are something of an adult education exercise and no more so than on this occasion. My hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who sometimes speaks for the Building Employers Confederation, is unable to be here owing to

European duties in the Chamber. He has asked me to make one or two points on his behalf about the Government amendments and to seek assurances on points that appear to be outstanding. If they are not, we must apologise to the Government, but our concern is almost inevitable in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a developer has only a leasehold interest in the property, I understand that he will be subject to the self-supply rule when he sublets the property without opting to tax. However, the tax charge will be levied as if he owned the freehold and not the leasehold. That is rough justice, because the value of the leasehold interest is almost always smaller than the value of the freehold and might produce an excessive charge. I hope that the Government will consult the industry and ensure that that unreasonable charge can be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that under the self-supply provisions in these paragraphs to schedule 3, where the developer is always going to make a taxable supply the initial input tax on the cost of construction and land purchase will always be fully recoverable by him? I think that that is substantially the point that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) has already raised. We are anxious that a situation does not arise whereby one lot of people pay, and then others cannot recover through contingent factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to buildings started before 1 August this year, could we have some clarification of the Customs and Excise interpretation of the point at which construction commences and where reconstruction might be deemed to commence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point on which I have a specific note is the definition of a developer. Our underlying concern is that there may be occasions when more than one person could be liable to the charge, even if that were not intended. Will the Government confirm that the intention is that the charge should apply once and for all for any one piece of land? What would happen if a developer developed a leasehold interest for an institution which would occupy the building for its own purposes, and the developer sold his interest to the institution and did not opt to tax? As I understand it, he will be liable under the rules, but the institution will be cast as the developer and might also get caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a specific point regarding the laudable intention of carrying on the relief of self-build houses. We have now unearthed a case in point in relation to the Costain Group. There has been concern that land being sold may or may not be developed with works on it and those works may be rather expensive. For example, derelict land may require expensive treatment before it can be offered for sale for development. With self-build arrangements, it is intended that this refund of income tax should be available for builders' materials, hardware, sanitary ware or other articles of a kind ordinarily installed by builders as fixtures. No one objects to that. But what will happen in relation to the land input? As in the case to which I briefly referred, a developer may want to impose VAT on the land on sale. If so, can the group of self-builders recover it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our exchanges, there has been perplexity in the Committee, if not on the Treasury Benches. We
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
should bear in mind the new and serious penalties for misdeclaration and the interest charges for default. I am not objecting to that principle. But will the Government assure us in these difficult initial circumstances that the Customs and Excise will be as flexible as possible in interpreting the rules and will be tolerant in dealing with innocent errors during the run-in period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me endeavour to respond to the points raised about these varied, complex and significant amendments, and the amendments to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked what would happen to buildings that were destroyed by an accident or fire and then had to be rebuilt. He wanted to know whether the VAT on the rebuilding—the self-supply—would effectively cover the cost of the value of the land. Although that would be a fairly rare occurrence, in general the insurance company will pay. That will meet the practical problems even if there is an element of metaphysical injustice which the hon. Gentleman has perceived. It would not be worth our while to develop some highly complex system to set right the position, even if we accepted the hon. Gentleman's analysis of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for my view about amendments Nos. 115 and 116. They both fall in the light of amendment No. 71 and become inapplicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a point also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), echoing the spirit of my hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). I was asked to confirm that under the new self-supply provisions, where the developer will always make a taxable supply, the initial input tax and the cost of construction and on land purchase will always be fully recoverable by the developer. I can give that assurance—the answer is, "Yes."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the amendment might be inapplicable, will the Minister assure us, in conjunction with the assurance that he has just given his hon. Friend, that any developer undertaking work before interest is acquired—provided that it is acquired—can recover his input?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come back to that point in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, I wish to consider the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. In answer to his first point, the developer may only hold the leasehold interest, but the freeholder is making the land available to the developer in return for either a premium or an ongoing share of the rental income from the development. Both parties are, therefore, adding value to the land and drawing income therefrom. Rather than tax the two interests separately, it is far easier to collect the tax once from the more active participant, namely the developer. He will reflect his liability for the charge on the freehold value in the terms he agrees with the freeholder. So the problem should be self-regulating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend's third question construction or reconstruction commences when on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
the particular facts a meaningful and ongoing start has been made to the construction process. Customs would be looking for good evidence of such a start, and also evidence, for example, that planning permission has been obtained and building contracts let.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand from my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary that it is a matter of the case-by-case interpretation of the facts of development rather than some general term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Substantial evidence is, and usually will be, available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend's fourth point, the charge will arise only once in the circumstances to which he referred. It will be paid by the developer who first makes an exempt grant or by the developer who, prior to an exempt grant being made, occupies other than as a fully taxable person. In any event the parties to a development will in future agree which of them is to be the chargeable person, if anyone is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my Friend raised the question of VAT on building plots purchased by do-it-yourself householders. We already have that problem in mind and several others where the margin sum VAT may enter into housing costs. It is unlikely that many individuals will obtain their building plots from taxable persons who have opted for taxation. However, in theory, it could happen, and I can give him an undertaking that I shall consider the point carefully before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham. Under the new scheme a developer will be able to recover all his input tax even if he does not have an interest in the land at the time that the construction commences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Government amendment No. 71 is accepted will a developer who has developed and intends to sell within three years as a new building, but meanwhile leases perhaps to exempt tenants—still be unable to recover his inputs although he will be required to standard rate the building when he sells it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should write an answer to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I put the Question on amendment No. 71, it would be helpful if the hon. Member for Wrexham will say whether he wishes
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
formally to move any of the amendments to the proposed amendment. If so, it must be done now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, thank you, Mr. Crowther. We want to make progress. We do not wish formally to move anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 162, line 15, after "order", insert
	<br><q><p>"subject to affirmative resolution of the House of Commons".</p></q>
We can dispose of this amendment extremely quickly. If the Economic Secretary can tell me why the amendment should not be accepted, I shall willingly beg to ask leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I sympathise with his concern about parliamentary powers in such matters, but paragraph 8 of schedule 65A gives only limited power to amend the schedule. The order-making power is limited to such amendments as are necessary or expedient in consequence of the making of an order to vary schedule 5 or 6 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983, that is those dealing with zero-rating and exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orders varying schedules 5 or 6 can be by affirmative resolution where a relief is being withdrawn or narrowed in scope and negative for a new or extended relief. Consequential amendments to schedule 6A will normally be done in the same order which makes the amendments to schedules 5 or 6. Even if that were not so, it would not be wise to require an affirmative resolution for an amendment which was consequential on one which itself required a negative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will think it appropriate to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
