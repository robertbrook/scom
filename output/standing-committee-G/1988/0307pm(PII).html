	<p>(	<i>Afternoon</i>)</p>
	<p>[	<i>Part II</i>]</p>
	<p>[MR. JOHN HUNT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Local Government and Housing Bill</h1></div>
	<p>[Continuation from col. 218]</p>
	<p>9.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may recall, Mr. Hunt, that before we adjourned I was trying to assist the educational process of the Minister. He had just introduced the interesting new legal doctrine that a person should not be allowed to appeal because it caused uncertainty and delay. That was an interesting innovation in what, I accept, is not criminal or civil law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that individuals will lose their civil liberties and their right to participate in political activity in a democracy. Anyone who has that right restricted should be able to appeal, but the Minister gives that right only to those who earn more than £13,500 a year. That is a bizarre and unreasonable way of deciding whether someone should have the right. Those whose rights are restricted in that way should not simply have to accept, in effect, what the Government have said—that they cannot particpate in the party political process or, if they do, they must give up their jobs. That is unacceptable. As the Government have chosen that course, they should provide a right of appeal for everyone and not only for those who earn more than £13,500 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that none of his friends in local authorities opposed the provision. Before the adjournment I was about to read what the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association said, as it seems to sum up its attitude to the first three clauses. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Association is concerned that the definition of politically restricted posts is too widely drawn and in particular that the restriction on dual tracking for officers who deal with the public is drafted in such a way that it would be extremely difficult for local authorities to implement."</p></blockquote>
The Minister cannot claim that I am using casual quotes from Conservative councillors. That was the considered view of the Conservative-controlled London Boroughs Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The association says clearly that the provision is too difficult for local authorities to implement. It is drafted in a peculiar way and is too restrictive. If the Minister will not listen to the Opposition or to other bodies, he should at least listen to Conservative party councillors and allow them to appeal against what is described as a restrictive system, one which
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would be extremely difficult for local authorities to implement."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to consider those words. If they represent the reality, it is not unreasonable to argue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
that, yet again, the Minister is imposing on local authorities rules and regulations that will make their lives even more difficult. In so doing, people's civil rights may be affected because of a local authority's decision. As the LBA rightly said, it is a difficult decision to make; it is not a clear one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that mistakes will be made. The Minister says that that may be so, but there can be no appeal. If he persists in that view, no one should have any illusion about what the Government are doing. The core of the Opposition's argument is that the Government have constantly attacked both Labour and Conservative local authorities and are undermining and destroying them. That undermines morale in local authorities and destroys local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the electorate to decide whether it likes what local authorities do or do not do, not for the Minister. If the electorate does not like them, it should get rid of them. If the Minister introduces new rules and regulations which Conservative councillors describe as too restrictive and, in effect, to complex, it is for him to justify them and to ensure that individuals can appeal against decisions which are almost certain to be wrong in some instances. It is grossly unsatisfactory for him to draw a magic line between those who earn more than £13,500 a year and can appeal and those who earn less than that and cannot appeal, with some ifs and buts in an intermediate position. I return to the Minister's own words when he described an appeals system as causing uncertainty and delay and therefore one which he is not prepared to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our country constructed legal rules on that basis, no one would have a right to appeal against a conviction in a court of law. All of us would consider that to be wrong. My argument is that this issue is not essentially different. I accept that we are not dealing with criminal or civil law, with a matter being argued before a judge. But the same rights of natural justice apply. The Minister has a duty to ensure that everyone has the right to appeal, without exception. If he removes those rights, at the very least he should allow people to appeal if they think that their rights have been wrongly taken away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are based on two principles. Amendment No. 53 refers to the criteria which may be used in granting exemptions from political restriction. Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 refer to the fact that local authorities should hear appeals first. It appears that there is no one behind me—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Despite my lack of an army, the arguments are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain whether the amendments apply only to the Principality of Wales or to the United Kingdom as a whole? Until now, no English or Scottish Opposition Member has been present. It seems that there is no one here. But it is important for us to know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patnick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! but he is from Yorkshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have two thirds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 refers to the criteria to be published. There should be exemptions from political restriction, but the Bill does not say how such exemptions are to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Bill, as in much local government legislation in the past few years, much depends on the state of the Secretary of State's mind. The Bill does not establish systems. It relies greatly on individuals. For example, the Secretary of State will publish regulations restricting political activity, but nothing in the Bill states what those restrictions should be. Moreover, the Secretary of State may grant exemptions to political advisers, but we are not told on what grounds that will be done. Appeals against restrictions will be judged by the Secretary of State's appointee on criteria which are left to that appointee's sole discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many thousands of local authority employees will be caught in the net. For their sake and the sake of those who want to enter local authorities, the criteria that should be used for granting exemptions should be tightly defined in regulations. I accept that it would be impractical to write definitions into the Bill at this stage, but when the regulations are laid down the three Secretaries of State could say what the criteria should be. With the wide variety of practices in local government that step would be of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second principle is that in the first instance local authorities should deal with those who appeal in line with practice in the Civil Service, where the employing Department makes the initial decision whether to grant permission to undertake political activity to those otherwise restricted. The Association of District Councils which, like the London Boroughs Association, is controlled by the Conservative party, rightly believes that a local authority is most likely to understand the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have some trust in local government. It is so varied and so many local authorities are controlled by different parties that there are bound to be exceptions, but I firmly believe that for the past few decades local government in Britain has been envied by the rest of the world. In general, Conservative, Labour, alliance and nationalist councils have been held up as examples of good practice. I believe that if the matter were left to the wisdom of local authorities the vast majority would work within the law. I do not like the Bill, but I am convinced that local authorities of all parties will work within its terms. If they genuinely feel that they have to apply its criteria, that will be good for local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and other Conservative Members may say, "We cannot trust all local authorities to do so," but that is no reason for completely changing the constitution governing local authorities. If, in the Government's view, a few local authorities appear to be doing badly, that does not mean that all the councils in the land have to be led by the nose. If the associations' advice is taken into account, each individual authority should say, "We regard these duties as being politically restricted and this is a difficult post."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's argument is most relevant. If the Government are so sure that under the poll tax authorities will be accountable to their electorates, why is this Bill necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, I and other members of the Committee served for the three months that the Local Government Finance Bill was considered in Committee. The Secretary of State and other Ministers told us constantly that the introduction of the community charge or poll tax would inevitably increase the accountability of local authorities. I thought that that was poppycock, and surely this Bill contradicts the Government's theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Government's 50th local government Bill, we must ask how far they trust local authorities. If the basis of the Bill is mistrust of local authorities, we are witnessing the end of local government and the beginning of local administration, which is not the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday, we celebrated in Westminster Abbey, 100 years of county government. The system was set up in 1888 by the then Liberal Government. We celebrated a century of sensible and reasonable government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not wish to give a plaudit to the

Liberal Government, Lord Salisbury was responsible, and the point was made clearly by the Archbishop of Canterbury in his sermon. I was pleased that Church and state are united on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My belief is that the Conservative Administration of the Marquis of Salisbury was in 1894, but there we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may correct the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). The Salisbury Government was in power from 1886 to 1892, the Gladstone Government was in power from 1892 to 1894, Lord Roseberry's Government was in power from 1894 to 1895 and then Lord Salisbury—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Enough of this seminar. We will now proceed with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my former history students will not read our proceedings, or my credibility will be greatly dented. It does not matter whether the system was introduced by a Liberal Government under Mr. Gladstone or by a Conservative Government under the Third Marquis of Salisbury—at least I remembered his number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear a great deal about Victorian values. The introduction of the county councils and of urban district councils in 1894 surely showed a belief that local government founded within the people was to be trusted because it was close to the people. Ultimately, local government is trustworthy, so can we not extend that belief? If a council officer applies for exemption under criteria that should be strictly laid down by Secretaries of State, surely the local authority can determine whether his post should be restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to an officer in charge of allocating houses. Our debate showed that the officer's responsibilities would vary from one authority to another. In some authorities, houses are allocated on a points system, in others they are allocated by members of the authority and in others there is a different system. The restrictive nature and sensitivity of the post varies according to the authority. Surely it is for each authority to decide whether the post is sensitive and should be restricted. In another authority, the post might simply involve moving paper around and not be sensitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely to heavens, in those circumstances, a local authority should be trusted to decide whether an officer should be restricted. The Government should think seriously. With 70,000 or 80,000 people involved, there will be a nightmare of bureaucracy unless we are careful how we lay down the rules at this early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) has invested local authorities with almost metaphysical worth but, as he suggested by his reference to the Local Government Act 1888, local authorities are creatures of statute. They were created by Parliament under legislation such as the municipal reform measures of 1834, the 1894
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
legislation and the Poor Relief Act 1601. Authorities have no power other than that which is derived by statute because they are created by Parliament. It is therefore important that Parliament should lay down the rules under which local authorities operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen is going off at half cock when he attacks the idea that we in this House should lay down the rules governing local authorities and says that they should be given the right to operate under their own rules without reference to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 53 seeks to establish that the criteria for deciding exemptions should be made by regulation, rather than laid down in the Bill. If such criteria were laid down, they would be on the basis referred to by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about local authorities taking the decisions. There have been enough examples of abuse by local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland to convince us that we cannot allow local authorities that abuse the system to be judge and jury in their own court. The vast majority of local authorities act properly and there is no twin-tracking in them, but the law cannot be drafted to deal with a minority of authorities without encompassing them all. Laws cannot name specific authorities. The Bill is designed to cope with existing and future abuses. The vast majority of good local authorities will not be affected because they operate properly. The clause is aimed at the others, and the amendment would drive a coach and horses through it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to remove the effect of clause 3(2)(b), which is that the person who is appointed will determine whether an exemption is appropriate. The person who is appointed by the Secretary of State will determine the criteria by which he judges the merits of an application for exemption. Not only does the Bill confer substantial discretion on the Secretary of State, it confers substantial discretion on the person he appoints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another place, the Lord Chancellor has embarked on a course of action which may reduce lawyers' incomes. In this Bill, the Government may be hell bent on doing the opposite. The clause is precisely the kind of provision which may give rise to legal challenge. It is not difficult to envisage politically motivated people challenging legally the failure to grant exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put aside my natural concern for lawyers north and south of the border when telling the Government that it is inappropriate, to echo the language of the Bill, that the discretion to determine whether exemption is given is to be exercised not by the Secretary of State but by the Secretary of State's creature and without criteria or values that are scrutinised by Parliament. That is wholly unacceptable, especially in the context of the Government's arguments to justify earlier clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will command the support of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr.

Campbell). I am pleased that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is present because I shall give him another example of my desire to help the Committee. If he had been here earlier, he would have heard another example. I hope that he will stay with us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not if I can help it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the hon. Gentleman's view, the Committee is tired of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reasoning behind the amendment. We shall table an amendment on Report which will lay down the criteria on the face of the Bill. It will be connected with the criteria that have already been proposed. We envisage that the independent adjudicator would exercise some discretion within the criteria—I think that the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East would agree with this—which will not be far removed from what is set out in clause 2(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) mentioned our difficulties with accepting the other amendments. The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) is right to say that a high proportion of local government officers and councils behave reasonably. The difficulty is that some, in major centres, do not. It is not appropriate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke suggested when he spoke about the genesis of local government, to leave it to local authorities to interpret something that is designed for the protection of the public. We may disagree about that, but we can agree on the first point and I hope that, with the assurance, the hon. Member for Torfaen will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by what the hon. Gentleman said about local government. He anchored his observations on yesterday's events. I believe that the future of local government is much better protected by ensuring that activities and attitudes that are less than the best are removed. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, historically, British local government was a model for people abroad, but I am not sure that they would take some of our present local government as a model. During the week, I am a resident of Ealing. I do not think that that borough would be taken as a model, and nor would some other London boroughs. I am sad about that and hope that it will change. It will change if we set higher standards. The hon. Gentleman will agree that we are both trying to do that even though—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a waste of time arguing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that it is a waste of time arguing.

I hope that no one from South Korea is shown the London borough of Brent, although I am not sure that the Labour party would want that. I hope, too, that no one will be taken to the county of Derbyshire, because no Labour supporter that I have met would want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should now leave that subject. If we introduce an amendment, at least the hon. Gentleman can argue on Report whether he thinks that it is right.

I do not wish to tie him down too much, but perhaps he can give us a few more details. Does he intend to have a set of national criteria that the person appointed under clause 3 should apply to every application? Or does he intend that the person appointed should establish a set of criteria that should then be published? I want to know whether the Secretary of State or the person appointed will lay down the criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is kind not to press me on too much detail at this stage. The criteria, as I see them, will be broad, and will appear in the legislation. In other words, they will be established by Parliament, not by either the Secretary of State or the adjudicator. The adjudicator will naturally establish acceptable ways to apply the rules, and more information about the mechanism will be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were careful in responding to the hon. and learned Gentleman's point about publishing the reasons because we do not wish people who do not want the reasons to be made public to feel that that is unavoidable. There is a difficulty. In normal circumstances, it would be perfectly proper, but I can

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I withdrew the amendment, I shall say something about the Minister's comments on some local authorities. There are bound to be different problems in a local government system that is as diverse and varied as that in Britain, and those problems are bound to be dealt with by local authorities—irrespective of their political persuasions—in different ways. For every Camden there is a Bradford, for every Brent there is a Westminster. Surely the argument rests on whether a Bill as big as this should be the means by which the Brents or the Bradfords are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 5, line 41, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the provisions of section 56(9) of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 shall not apply in respect of any payment made in accordance with the provisions of this section."</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief. First, I put on record that Conservative Members cannot irritate me or my colleagues about the length of time that I spend or do not spend in this Committee, because I am here to represent my people, not theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a simple truth: if the Government appoint persons and designate those persons outside local government as part of their functions, it would be helpful if they agreed to pay for them. If someone is appointed by a local authority to carry out functions that are decided by the local authority, I accept that the normal grant structure would apply. All we ask is that the cost should be borne by the Government, not by the local authority. It would be quite wrong if other services were affected, or if reductions were made elsewhere, or if other salaries were reduced to pay for a Government institution that is imposed on local authorities. These persons will be carrying out a Government function, not a local authority function. Therefore they should be paid by the Government. That is simple and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to throw us spice, as we used to say when I was a child, they can help local government by carrying out their promise in the Conservative manifesto of 1979 and in the local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980—since abandoned—that anything imposed on local government would be paid for by the Government. They have not implemented a number of key Acts,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
including parts of the Children Act, because the cost had to be borne by central Government, yet they have introduced a Bill that imposes additional costs. As I said earlier, it is an ideological Bill and has nothing to do with the provision of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have a bed to go to and who prefer to represent their constituents in a sharp and open fashion in the daytime, rather than droopy-eyed at night—believing that late nights and keeping one another up all night are no substitute for work—hope that the Minister will accept this sensible and small amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) for keeping his comments brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to his first comment, I shall try to explain for the umpteenth time why members of the Committee—not just Conservative Members—are a little upset with him today. I respectfully ask him to realise that it is not what he is saying that is unacceptable; he is perfectly entitled to express his view on behalf of his constituents, the Labour party, the wider world, or whoever. But it is quite unacceptable for him to come in at the last moment, when the atmosphere in the Committee has changed so dramatically during the day that we are making progress. The hon. Gentleman smiles, but I ask him to accept what I say in the spirit in which I say it. If he keeps returning to the subject I shall return to it, as will my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government. Whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not, he is completely out of step with his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said, and I can assure him that his fears are groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of amendment No. 54, section 56(9) of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, is not and could not be appropriate. I hope to be as brief as the hon. Gentleman was when I say that the money will come from central Government funds. We do not intend to charge local authorities, either directly or indirectly. The Bill clearly states that the Secretary of State will make sure that money for this purpose is voted by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman. I cannot accept the amendment because there is no need for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's comments. Subsection (9)(b) of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State…may deduct from the aggregate amount of the block grant for that year, such amount, not exceeding the total of the expenditure so defrayed, as appears to him to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Having listened to the Minister saying that this money will come from the Government, can we take it that the Government will not recover any of that money from the block grant given to local government, if the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has my assurance on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned about the implications in clause 3, particularly when we are told that it is the Government's intention to appoint a person to adjudicate on appeals from people who are caught up in the exemptions and political restrictions on their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall hear much more about this issue because of representations from people caught in the net of political restrictions. When those people appeal to one individual appointed by the Secretary of State, they will be pressing hard for a second opinion on the points made during that appeal. I am sure that such a position will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, I am sure that representatives of people employed in local government and local government organisations such as the Association of District Councils, the Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities will be making it clear to the Minister that the appeals system should be reviewed. The argument will be that the magnitude of such a task for one person is undemocratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there are appeals against gradings and payment of increments, not one person judges that, a tribunal of people hear appeals according to the purple book referred to earlier by the Minister. That has been so for many years, and it is hard to understand why the Government are making changes to that procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We raised the point on clause 3(1) that a tribunal or panel should be appointed rather than an individual. We also expressed concern about how the back-up staff to the adjudicator will be set up. While we accept and appreciate the assurances given by the Under-Secretary on expenditure, the Bill states that clearance must be given by the Treasury. We know all about the attitude of the Treasury towards local government, therefore many big questionmarks hangover this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that reconsideration should be given to some of the issues raised in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I speak for the entire Government, not part of the Government. My hon. Friend made it perfectly clear that this money will come from general funds and not from any other money to be given to local authorities, and I repeat his assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 3 is to make less powerful the proposals of the Widdicombe committee. For many people, there is a sort of appeal which we hope will meet the need as effectvely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) suggests that there are other sorts of appeals in other circumstances, and I know that we approach this issue from different points of view. Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
Members look back to a time when few people would argue that they could do two jobs and the issue would hardly ever arise. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that in some areas it will be manifestly clear that no controversy can arise. I am certain that a computer engineer, earning £15,000 a year, who is working for a local authority and who never meets the public or gives advice can be involved in party politics. That is an extreme case. On the other hand, there will be many areas where someone meets the public and represents the council whose attitude and position is clearly independent. That is another extreme case. Between them lies not a large area of dissent and the question is whether we shall be better with several or one person. I believe that one person will be able to interpret clearly the guidelines laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a number of assurances. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Normanton for accepting them. They are properly meant and I hope that he will be happy with the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 provides a proper means of appeal for those who are in the groups not allowed to take political action. It is a variant on Widdicombe that the Committee should be pleased to accept because it underlines the Government's commitment to civil liberties and gives people the opportunity to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end by repeating that in the Government's opinion the purpose of the clause, like so many others in the Bill, is to protect the civil liberties of the majority of the population who have the right not to worry about the distinction between those who are properly party-politically motivated and those who are impartially motivated. They are two different types of people who take different roads in public service. I am not saying that one is less good than the other but that one precludes the other. That is the real issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have tried hard to be helpful to the Committee and I hope that it will feel that clause 3 can stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DESIGNATION AND REPORTS OF HEAD OF PAID SERVICE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Clause 4(1)(a) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to designate one of their officers as the head of their paid service".</p></blockquote>
In most local authorities, the chief executive currently fills that post and carries out the functions that are set out in the clause. The chief executive is the senior officer and has the back-up staff and resources necessary to carry out those functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if there is a dispute between the chief executive and the appointed person about the provision of resources needed to fulfill the responsibilities and obligations of the post of head of paid service? If no guidance is given, the department
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
could indulge in empire building. Who will resolve differences on the provision of resources? Will it be the Secretary of State or the council? Will there be an additional charge on the poll tax? The Minister said that all the costs will fall on the Exchequer. A straightforward application for a reasonable department will go through without any problem, but if there is an allegation of empire building and someone challenges the establishment of the department, who will adjudicate? Who will decide whether a senior officer or a group of officers will be in charge? Will the department be larger than necessary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person who is given the authority to carry out this duty will submit his ideas about the department. If they are challenged, who will adjudicate? I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the Secretary of State or the council will decide. If it is to be the council, and if the resources for the department are more than the Secretary of State believes should be committed, will he cap that department so that extra resources approved by the council may be charged to poll tax payers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will decide whether value for money has been achieved and whether the quality of service is acceptable to ratepayers? Will the quality of service be set by the council? There are glaring omissions from this part of the Bill. It makes no provision for an assessment of the quality of service. Will the ombudsman be called in to decide on the grey areas? If there is a challenge of maladministration by the department, will that come under the ombudsman, as do other local government departments, or will it be separate? Will the postholder, when dealing with the mechanics of the service provisions, also deal with the problems envisaged by members of the council? Will the postholder co-ordinate the functions of the department and the levels, grade and organisation of the staff, or will it be done by the council or the Secretary of State? The Minister should deal with those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that the Minister should deal with some issues relating to the quality of service. Who will decide if there is a dispute? One would assume that it would be left to the adjudicator. Will the department be subject to the ombudsman procedure in the event of there being any allegation of maladministration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of local government on this matter are also important. The Association of District Councils suggests that the exercise will be costly and that the money would be better spent elsewhere, because officers are already doing the jobs for which the Government wish to create new posts. Evidence
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
suggests that there is dissatisfaction with the proposals. Will the Minister reconsider the proposals in clause 4 and allow local government to work out its own procedures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) seems to suggest that there is a difference of opinion between our side of the committee and his. I can only describe it as a yawning chasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a misunderstanding about the function of clause 4, but I find it strange, if not bizarre, to hear a Socialist talk about empire building. In my experience, no party has been more in favour of empire building than the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee reported a need for increased efficiency. Although I accept, as has my right hon. Friend, that several local authorities—some controlled by Socialists and others controlled by Conservatives—are efficient, several are not. Management in local authorities should be centre stage and the Widdicombe report seems to support that view. That is increasingly important because of our proposals for competitive tendering and the community charge. We therefore propose by statute to place emphasis on management as a central feature of every local authority. Clause 4 simply implements the White Paper proposal that each council should be required to designate an officer to advise on the co-ordination of its functions, organisation and staffing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the clause heading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Designation and reports of head of paid service".</p></blockquote>
"Head" is in the singular. The clause aims to strengthen management co-ordination in local authorities and to promote a clearer relationship between members and officers. The Widdicombe committee recommendations dealt with those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton has thoroughly misunderstood the clause. He talked as though the head of the paid service was to be a new appointment. The clause requires local authorities not to appoint a new post, but to designate an existing senior officer or post holder as head of the paid service. Where a local authority has a chief executive, it could not reasonably designate anyone else as head of the paid service. If it could, I should be interested to hear about it. Where no chief executive exists—some authorities cannot make up their minds who the chief executive should be or decide that they do not want one—another chief officer must be appointed to that post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause is written as it is because, despite the suggestion of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives, we do not want to force local authorities into having a chief executive, but we felt that it was important to have somebody responsible for that particular role. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) said, this is meant to give more freedom to local authorities than would a diktat stating that they have a chief executive who would then have to be the head of the paid service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am sure that the hon. Member for Normanton would accept that it could not be fairer. What could be more democratic? I recall Leeds city council choosing not to have a chief executive. No one is saying that authorities must have a chief executive, but, as delineated in the Bill, they must have a
	<br><blockquote><p>"head of their paid service".</p></blockquote>
All talk of a new department is wide of the mark. The duties on the head of the paid service are the natural duties of a normal chief executive or senior officer appointed to that post who advises his authority on the management of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ombudsman could examine maladministration by that officer, or by any other local authority officer, but it is unlikely that questions of maladministration could arise in regard to advice to authorities on organisation and management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to cover all the points raised by the hon. Member for Normanton. The outstanding item is who will pay for the facility. If the system works in the way the Widdicombe recommendations envisage, so that there is improved management in local authorities which would then become more efficient, it is only reasonable that local authorities should find those resources themselves. With efficient management, they should save resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has only partly explained the clause's consequences. Although clause 4(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>It shall be the duty of every relevant authority—"(a) to designate one of their officers as the head of their paid service",</p></blockquote>
paragraph (b) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide that officer with such staff, accommodation and other resources as are, in his opinion, sufficient to allow his duties under this section to be performed."</p></blockquote>
If that officer's report about his needs differs from what the councillors believe he should have, who decides—the council or the Secretary of State? If it is the Secretary of State, will he accept full responsibility for any overstaffing in that department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is linking the clause with the responsibility given to an adjudicator. That link does not exist. It should be a natural management function of a local authority to run its affairs efficiently. The clause will assist local authorities to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is clear. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) It shall be the duty of every relevant authority—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) to designate one of their officers as the head of their paid services".</p></blockquote>
I said that that means the chief executive and the Minister generally accepts that the chief executive should have that role, but the clause goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) to provide that officer with such staff, accommodation and other resources as are, in his opinion"—</p></blockquote>
that is the officer's opinion, not the council's—
	<br><blockquote><p>"sufficient to allow his duties under this section to be performed."</p></blockquote>
If the officer's department is bigger than the chief executive's department or the finance department, or is, in the opinion of council members too large,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
who makes the decision? The Bill gives the officer responsibility to submit his scheme. If that scheme is not acceptable to the council, has that officer the right to appeal to the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives no clarification—it stops at the end of the cliff. People ask what it means. It is cliff-hanging. We should have some clarification so that we know what the clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the council is to make the decision, the clause should be amended to include the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"at the resolve of the council or the relevant local authority".</p></blockquote>
That matter should be clarified before we leave the clause as people in local government want to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the manner in which the discharge by the authority of their different functions is co-ordinated"</p></blockquote>
which, again, is the responsibility of the officer. The number of grades of staff that the authority requires to discharge its functions is wide open. The Minister does not do justice to the Bill. It will control all local government and give the Secretary of State more power over local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have experience of local government. I was chairman of the committee that was concerned with the reorganisation of Wakefield district council. When the chief officers submitted their proposed structures and the number of staff that they would require, council members immediately queried whether they were desirable. If the same applies here, and there is a difference of opinion between the individual proposing the establishment and the council, who will make the final decision about the structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the narrow technical question, I concede that the hon. Gentleman is right to bring it to our attention. I was befuddled why no amendments had been tabled to the clause and believed—wrongly—that perhaps his anxiety about the clause was somewhat synthetic. However, the hon. Gentleman has latched on to a point that needs answering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a parallel here with the Local Government Finance Act 1988. If there is a dispute between the chief paid officer and the local authority about the resources needed for the limited management function to which I referred earlier, the officer's opinion will prevail. That provision which gives the officer the power to decide what he needs to carry out those duties parallels exactly the provision in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which gives the chief finance officer power to decide what resources he needs to carry out his duty to report to the council on illegal or improper financial matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

described would be extremely rare. We all hope that it would not occur. A number of hon. Members have been leaders of local authorities and have experienced local government at the so-called sharp end. There would be a total breakdown of local government and its functions if it got to that stage. The hon. Member for Normanton was right to raise the question because it may be raised in councils throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has revealed an important point. I agree with the Minister that, in the majority of situations, there would be no conflict and the matter would not arise. However, increased pressure on budgets leads councils—quite rightly in my view—to look at central services rather than the direct provision of services to the public to make expenditure reductions. Most finance officers or treasurers have been very co-operative in scrutinising their services to help the council look at others. I can think of at least one local authority which has major budget difficulties at present. Pressure on the treasurer's department could be such that it might say that it, above other services, should have the resources it needs to carry out an internal audit. Is there any mechanism to redress that under the Bill? It may be a small point, especially at this time of night, but it could be an important one in the counterbalance between the essential delivery of services and the central back-up services that inevitably should be looked at first when reductions are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straightforward answer to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) is no. We want the provisions in the Bill to be parallel to those in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. I have truthfully no way of knowing what debate went on. I did not have my present responsibilities then and did not guide that Act through Standing Committee. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement that such an eventuality is unlikely. There is a dilemma, even for Opposition Members. The chief paid officer could make a recommendation that led to an increase in some departments in a council. I should have thought the Widdicombe committee was on to this—that, in the majority of cases a recommendation would lead to a reduction and a more efficient handling of the services provided by that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there is a division between the two sides of the Committee and that certain parts of that division cannot be reconciled, but I hope that the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to put a further point to the Minister in view of his remark that the designated officer will decide the level of his establishment. If a member of the local authority questions that decision, the officer's decision will count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 gives to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the head of a relevant authority's paid service"</p></blockquote>
the powers to set out his proposals on
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and grades of staff required by the authority for the discharge of their functions"—</p></blockquote>
that means every establishment in that authority—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the organisation of the authority's staff and … the appointment and proper management of the authority's staff."</p></blockquote>
Will the principle that applies to his department apply to other departments? If his power is challenged, who will decide the issue? The Minister said that in an individual head's department, the individual will decide. The head of the service must send a report to every member of the council for consideration and each member will have to decide on the issue. If there is a difference of opinion, in other establishments will the designated officer decide, not the council? It will be difficult for the council to say that in the finance, education or housing departments the establishment shall be X if the designated officer says that it shall be Y. In his own department, will he have full authority to decide what the establishment will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the question that I was originally asked concerned a dispute. It has been acknowledged that it is unlikely that there would be a dispute, but I am not saying that there will not be some along the way. My experience of local government is that no chief officer wishes to be seen to cut his own staff. As the Bill shadows the Local Government Finance Act 1988, in the eventuality of a dispute, however rare that may be, the view of the senior paid officer, known as the designated paid officer, will prevail. End of story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been told that the designated officer will decide on establishment. Will that apply to the fire service, the combined police authorities and other joint schemes, such as the waste disposal amalgamation scheme? In Wakefield, the district authority is responsible for the joint police committee and waste disposal in west Yorkshire. Will the person designated under the clause also decide establishment levels on behalf of the five other authorities in west Yorkshire? Will the one person have the power to make decisions for the joint authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are getting to the nitty-gritty. We were being taken to the edge of the cliff and the lemmings among the Conservative Members were prepared to accept that. We have insisted that we need clarification because we want to know who will be responsible. In an officer's own establishment, his authority will count. In other establishments in the local authority to which that person is appointed, his authority will count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to clause 17, which describes the authorities involved. As there are a number of them, we should have some clarification, because the issue is broadening. The Minister has stirred up a can of worms that will really cause problems. [Hon. Members: "Maggots."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—yes, and staff—that can be made available only for the advisory services covered in the clause. We are talking about a narrow point [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman will just have to accept that. I have said this a couple of times, and when I said it a third time, the hon. Gentleman was on to it in a flash.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head of the paid service is entitled only to the staff needed to carry out his duties to report to the council. All other decisions are the responsibility of the local authority, so the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) is getting into a state unnecessarily. I am here to help him. I do not mind using the material used by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I thought that that was pretty good. The hon. Member for Normanton and I have a mutual respect and regard for each other. It is a mistake for him to suppose that the whole department of the head of the service will be covered by his entitlement. It is only for the staff needed to prepare the report on management questions. That was the recommendation of the Widdicombe report, which we have accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must draw attention to the fact that what the Minister has just said is different from what he said earlier. He had said that the Government were following the Local Government Finance Act 1988—end of message. However, when we pointed out that other authorities were involved, the Minister obviously had second thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the head of a relevant authority's paid service, where he considers it appropriate to do so in respect of any proposals of his with respect to any of the matters specified in subsection (3) below, to prepare a report to the authority setting out his proposals."</p></blockquote>
One of the matters specified is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and grades of staff required by the authority for the discharge of their functions".</p></blockquote>
So one of the responsibilities of an officer will be to present a report to the authority setting out the number and grade of staff required by the authority for the discharge of their functions. That signifies that this individual must look at every department and every member of staff and then present a report to the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter on which the officer must make proposals is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the organisation of the authority's staff".</p></blockquote>
In other words, if he believes that two departments should be merged, or that a separate department should be set up, it is his duty to say so in his report. If the council does not accept that, what will stand—the officer's report or the council's decision to override it? The Minister said that as far as he is concerned, the principle that applied to the finance officer under the Local Government Finance Act 1988 will apply under this legislation. There was no doubt in my mind about what the Minister meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is retracting that, and if he is back pedalling, will he tell us what will happen if, after discussion, the council overturns the report on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
establishment of the departments and how the staff of the authority should be organised? Is that final, or will the officer return in a few months' time with a new report, wasting time and money, because his first report was overturned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need clarification of the important principle that is involved. If we do not get that tonight, how can local government—or anyone—say what the principle of the Bill is? The Minister originally said that if the report on the staffing, resources and organisation was presented to the council and the council would not accept it, the officer's decision would stand. Is the Minister sticking to that? If not, how long will it be before the officer can present a further report if the council overturns the original report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall I say it again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not told me anything yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps saying that. He can hardly say that I have not yet told him anything and then go on to say that he is picking up the individual parts of what I am saying, all of which I am prepared to stand by. If he looks carefully at the 	<i>Hansard</i> record of our discussions, he will find what I have said. I have it written down, but I shall say it again. We were talking about the number of staff and resources for that designated officer to prepare the report on management questions. I went on to make it abundantly clear that the responsibility for the number of staff and resources in the local authority as a whole would have to be the responsibility of that local authority. We are simply talking about the narrow management functions that the Widdicombe report recommended be improved. Otherwise, the designated paid officer would be running the whole council single-handed. Perhaps that is still in the hon. Gentleman's mind. The hon. Gentleman could not in his wildest dreams or nightmares presume that that was to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am suggesting that the hon. Gentleman got it wrong because he thought that another new officer was to be appointed and another new department created. I have cleared up that point. It is assumed, and I think the hon. Gentleman realises, that the officer would normally be the chief executive. Next, I am saying that what the responsibilities will be is clearly stated, particularly in subsections (2), (3) and (4). The provisions are not difficult, or in complicated legalese. Those will be the officer's responsibilities, and the time limit within which he will have to report to the council. The precise question that the hon. Gentleman asked me in the first place was about the resources—meaning money and people; we all know that resources can be interpreted in both those ways—for the officer to perform that function and report to that council. I hope that I have reassured him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be fairly brief, not least because my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) has made a number of the points that I had intended to mention. The debate that we have just had was useful, and my hon. Friend picked up some important points. The Government have not thought through the matter and have not worked out what the role of the chief executive already is in most authorities. They seem to be trying to impose on local authorities another structure that, as my hon. Friend said, at best will be empire building and at worst will confuse the issue of where power lies. Despite many attempts, the Minister was unable to say where the power lay to carry out these functions, if the postholder was not the chief officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say again that the power to run the local authority's business in the round obviously lies with the local authority. No one could misunderstand that. If there is a dispute between the designated officer to whom money resources are available and the local authority, his view will prevail. I cannot make the matter any clearer than that. My eldest child of seven could understand it. If Opposition Members do not agree with me, they should say so. To say that the Minister cannot explain it is no argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is answering the wrong question, as usual. When he has these little outbursts, it is crucial for him to remember that if he does not get the question right he is unlikely to get the answer right. The question is: what will happen if there are two different perceptions of who is doing the job? A person will be appointed, but the Minister said that the council will have the responsibility. Who is the council? The council is not an individual, it is a body of councillors who make decisions and instruct the officers and chief executive to carry them out. The Minister is imposing another structure which gives powers that are unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not understand. The various local authority bodies will advise him that there will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
be confusion about the interpretation of the Bill. Only time will tell who is right, but I suspect that this part of the Bill will cause confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82 might help the Minister to understand better. The Bill contains a glaring omission; it does not include a provision for assessing quality of service The Bill deals only with the mechanics of service. Subsection (3)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and grades of staff required by the authority for the discharge of their functions".</p></blockquote>
It does not mention the quality of the service to be provided. The problem is not just about numbers and who does what job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most local authorities are concerened about the quality of the service for people on the receiving end. Co-ordination of management services is usually one of the jobs of the chief executive. The Minister said that these functions will probably be carried out by the chief executive. If the chief executive is already doing this job in most authorities, why not let him get on with it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mistake that the Minister is making was also made in the 1960s when some people, with the best intentions in the world—like the Minister—tried to impose on local authorities inappropriate management structures. A classic example involved a number of local authorities which, with the best will in the world and with pressure from the management industry, adopted the mangement structure used by NASA in the United States to put a person on the moon. That was the wrong management structure because it was designed to achieve a single goal, whereas local authorities must provide quality of service across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessment of service quality is important. As a result of the compulsory competitive tendering imposed by the Government, services are provided out of house. The Conservative party's maxim of private sector is good and public sector is bad is not always borne out, as the experience of Wandsworth council shows. Wandsworth was in the forefront of privatising services, but its ratepayers and taxpayers have suffered as a result. It sacked ARA Catering because the quality of the services that it was providing to Wandsworth's old people's homes was so low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the head of the paid services responsible for co-ordinating the discharge of the authority's funding and for agreeing in-house staffing levels needs to look at the services that are being delivered. There may be reasons why the Government are not worried about the quality of services that are provided. Perhaps Ministers have not read the March edition of 	<i>Which?,</i> which gives the results of a survey conducted in England and Wales last year. Scotland was excluded because of the imminent introduction of the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
build in a provision that such an officer should pay attention to the quality of the service. The purpose of amendment No. 82 is to introduce the concept of quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman is harking back to clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but overall, I am worried about the quality of service, which needs to be examined with other matters. I am not sure that that will be done under clause 4 or clause 5. The designation of the officer is clearly relevant to that because if the authority was to get a designation wrong, we must have a provision to safeguard the quality of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the suggestion of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), but I do not think that the amendment would have that effect. First, there is no need for such an amendment because the head of the paid service would be required to report on the
	<br><blockquote><p>"proper management of the authority's staff"</p></blockquote>
"Proper management" cannot be estimated unless there is a quality of service. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman's example provies the point. When Wandsworth found that the quality of service was not satisfactory, it sacked the catering company concerned, whereas Southwark council did not sack its own old people's service that provided such a poor service to Nye Bevan house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is that, in those circumstances, a local authority cannot easily sack employees for providing a thoroughly bad service. The advantage of having an out-of-house service is that, if a company does not provide a service of adequate quality, the local authority can go elsewhere and find a company that can provide a good service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith gave Wandsworth as an example of the failure of private enterprise, but it is exactly the opposite. The great advantage of private enterprise is that is stands or falls by the quality of its service and its ability to meet contractual obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires the head of the paid service to report on proper management on the authority's behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I let the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) intervene, I shall try once again to clarify the clause without harking back to the previous clause. The distinction is that the individual appointed as a monitoring officer must have the resources to do the job of reporting, whereas the decisions about how that should be carried out and about its cost will be made by the council as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the amendment would have a different effect. It would ensure that the monitoring officer would not be able immediately to report that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
something was wrong but would have to argue about it for up to six weeks. That suggests that the monitoring officer is some figure from outer space, who has no connection with the local authority. It mirrors the mistake that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) made in an earlier debate. The officer will not be a figure from outer space, but will normally be the local authority's chief executive, although some authorities may have chosen not to have a chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put the problem clearly to the hon. Member for Hammersmith. We could have followed the advice of the Society of Local Authorities Chief Executives, which was to make it mandatory that the monitoring officer should always be the chief executive. The problem with that is that some local authorities do not have a chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith has occasionally accused me—delicately and elegantly, of course—of being dictatorial and of telling local authorities what they should do. When I say that a local authority does not have to have a chief executive, the hon. Gentleman says that I am confusing everybody. He cannot have it both ways. Local authorities can run their organisation exactly as they wish, but they must designate one person as the head of the paid service. The buck has to stop with someone, and that person will draw up plans of what the management needs and that will include the quality of service. If a local authority then says be off, at least it will know what it is talking about and what the report says. The local authority must provide the necessary resources and it must not expect to wait six weeks before the whistle is blown on any particular activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that not all local authorities have chief executives. Some authorities sack the chief executive and appoint a managing director, who is responsible solely to the leader of the council. That is the case with the City of Westminster council. Some authorities are able to remedy deficiencies with old people's homes without sacking the whole social services department. In Southwark, the council sacked only those responsible in the homes. However, does the Minister agree that the only person unsackable under the Bill is the chief monitoring officer? He will be protected and wrapped up in cotton wool to such an extent that the only person to whom he is accountable is himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. The chief monitoring officer is protected from arbitrary sacking of the disgraceful sort that David Bookbinder performed. He appointed Mr. Reg Race on party political grounds but then sacked him nine months later without telling the public how much he had been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brightside should be a bit careful. I hope that he is not suggesting that statutory payments to people should be stopped when they have already paid their premiums. I thought that the Labour party was especially keen to protect such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
payments. I should like to see whether he could show me an example in which a local authority trades union or staff association has demanded that a former employee should receive less than his entitlement. If the monitoring officer is to be sacked, he is protected only by the fact that it should be after a report made by independent people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would mean that the monitoring officer would have to wait some time before he could give advice. There would be 21 days before the monitoring officer need advise and 21 days while his advice were being considered. That would be six weeks before he could draw the attention of the rest of the council to the problem. By then the issue might be cut and dried with no possibility of recovery. It may be thought that it is an extreme example, but, without treading on anyone's delicate toes, there have been cases recently where documents have been withheld from all members of the council and the public. It is not an unusual example, so I hope that the amendment will be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 6, line 39, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"but shall not be their chief finance officer."</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. There seems to be a conflict between clause 5 of the Bill and section 114 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. Unless those two separate pieces of legislation are clarified, it seems that there will be two statutory obligations on two local government officers to produce a report about the same injustice, wrongdoing or incompetence by a local authority, because both section 114 and clause 5 lay obligations on people to produce reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 114 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chief finance officer of a relevant authority shall make a report under this section is it appears to him that the authority, a committee or officer of the authority, or a joint committee on which the authority is represented—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) has made or is about to make a decision which involves or would involve the authority incurring expenditure which is unlawful".</p></blockquote>
Clause 5 states that it shall be the duty of a relevant authority's monitoring officer to prepare a report to the authority if in his view there is a contravention by the authority, by any committee and so on, as set out in subsection (2)(a). Therefore, if something went wrong in a local authority, the chief finance officer would start to prepare a report under section 114 and the monitoring officer would start to produce one under clause 5. That surely should be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wondered whether the draftsmen had the Local Government Finance Act in mind because the notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are currently no requirements for any officer to be responsible for ensuring generally that an authority conducts its business lawfull and with propriety."</p></blockquote>
But clearly there is such a provision. It is in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and I have just read it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Most senior council officers consider they have a duty… this is a matter of professional duty rather than legal requirement."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
However, for one of them at least it is a legal requirement. There seems potential for confusion, and our amendment is one way round the problem. It seeks to remove the exclusion of the chief finance officer, so that the same chap in both pieces of legislation would prepare the same report. That is obviously not an ideal solution, and if the Government have another, naturally we shall listen to it sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to speak briefly in support of the amendment ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government mentioned that the monitoring officer would not be a figure from out space and, clearly, unless the amendment is accepted, he will not be a finance officer either, so we are gradually getting there. We know two things that he or she is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton accurately said that the monitoring officer is required to report on, among other matters, an unlawful act, and that under the Local Government Finance Act 1988 that is virtually what the chief finance officer is already required to do. Let me make my position clear. I do not say that the monitoring officer is invariably expected to be the chief finance officer, but it seems a little perverse that the chief finance officer should be excluded from being the monitoring officer, given the responsibilities which already belong to that post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again in an earlier debate, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government correctly pointed out that not all local authorities have chief executives. Precisely because of the responsibilities laid on chief finance officers by the 1988 Act every local authority must have a nominated chief financial officer. It is a matter of law, and local authorities are in deep trouble if they do not have one. So we are talking not about a mythical figure from outer space, out of the borough or out of the council, but about an office which already must exist by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses give only one reason why the monitoring officer should not be the chief finance officer. They state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a way of providing an additional check and balance it was proposed that the post responsible for legal and propriety matters could not be given to the chief finance officer."</p></blockquote>
I have been associated for years with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which is held in the highest regard by all local authority associations. Regardless of the political colour of the authorities in which individual members work, they have established a high reputation and they are relied on by ratepayers, councillors and the Government to produce accurate statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasoning in the notes on clause looks a little like belt and braces reasoning, and I look forward to hearing the Minister explain why the chief finance officer would not be appropriate for the post.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I join my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch in paying tribute to CIPFA. There is no difference between us. My experience in local government has taught me exactly the same as it has taught him in that regard. Its members are highly reputable and do a first-class job, and their professional body makes its representations to the Government in a responsible and constructive way. However—I know that this was not the main thrust of what my hon. Friend said—that is not the point. He must have deduced from the clause that it will be impossible for the three responsibilities, which I shall briefly discuss, to be vested in the hands of one individual. That is the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 makes it clear that the head of the authority's paid service could be the monitoring officer, so those positions could be held by one individual. Under a local government Act which has not been referred to although I know that my hon. Friends are aware of it—namely, the Local Government Act 1972—the chief finance officer of a local authority has considerable responsibilities which are sufficient for most chief officers to handle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch now comes back into play, because there will be at least two individuals looking at improved management performance and the management of the finances of the local authority, and there is the responsibility of the legal propriety of what is done by the authority. If there are two individuals, one may actually notice what goes on; one would be a check on the other. It is quite unacceptable, to me and perhaps to other Committee members, that those three roles should be vested in the hands of one individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that there might be room for conflict. However, there is a requirement that there should be proper consultation between the holders of all three offices before either the monitoring officer or the chief finance officer acts, and it is their professional responsibility to ensure that the advice which they give is properly co-ordinated. The professional bodies involved have already issued guidelines as to how the existing duties of chief finance officer should operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton has perhaps not noticed that the chief finance officer is required by an amendment to section 114 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which is contained in paragraph 27 of schedule 5 of this Bill, to consult the monitoring officer before reporting on illegal or improper expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There we have it. There is a minimum of two people involved, and there could be three. I reject the suggestion that all responsibilities should be put in the hands of a chief finance officer, as could happen if the amendment were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his explanation. I hope that, when asking one or two questions, I shall not sound too much like the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
I accept that, under clause 3, there is an obligation to consult before a report is prepared. None the less, it seems that there will be two reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a chief finance officer finds that his authority has entered into an unlawful lease. Under section 114(2) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, he is obliged to prepare a report on the lease. Clause 5(2)(a) covers any breach of law
	<br><blockquote><p>"or rule of law or of any code of practice made or approved by or under any enactment"</p></blockquote>
so the breach involving an unlawful lease also triggers the chap who we are designating under clause 5. He must consult the chief finance officer and is also under a statutory obligation
	<br><blockquote><p>"to prepare a report to the authority with respect to that proposal, decision or omission."</p></blockquote>
Will we end up with two reports? If not, where does the Bill relieve the second officer of the obligation to prepare a report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a superb answer—we could have a joint report as there would have been consultation between the two or, perhaps, three officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember when, occasionally, I got advice on the hoof about an amendment. Does my hon. Friend think that the Bill should be amended to make it clear that there can be a joint report to avoid duplication, or does he believe that the Bill already provides for a joint report and that there is no need for an amendment to resolve the confusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that an amendment is necessary for a joint report. If the system works as we envisage, a joint report can be submitted if there has been proper consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The designated head of the paid service, the monitoring officer and the chief finance officer have separate responsibilities. I do not entirely disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton when he suggests that there could be an overlap. I am the first to admit that, in some circumstances, that could well be the case. In practice, given the officers' specific responsibilities outlined in the Bill and, in respect of chief finance officers, in the Local Government Act 1972, with proper consultation, there should be no difficulty or conflict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Squire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the Committee wishes to make progress, but I have one small but important question. I remind the Committee that when either Act is triggered, there will be a potentially severe crisis in the authority. I am worried about the confusion and pressure that would ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have nothing more to add, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will note that we are not talking about a matter-of-fact incident that will arise week in, week out—we are discussing what will happen when an authority is publicly reported as being in considerable difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. We may consult further with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
ascertain whether it shares his view that all is well, and that there is little scope for confusion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 7, line 10, after "officer", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) to consult the Chairman of the authority (as defined in section 10(2) below); and".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that if I returned to my local authority, I would be hard pressed to find any officer wishing to become a monitoring officer. It will be a thankless task and one of the most unloved positions in local government. The only factor that might change my view is if that officer will be able to determine staff accommodation from resources. If that includes pay, one or two people might be interested in the job. Otherwise, I suspect that it will be a job that will be regarded by the majority of employees with tremendous distaste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the report that the monitoring officer must produce. The wording of the clause is vague. Although "consult" is imprecise, the phrase "so far as is practicable" will cause local authorities tremendous problems of interpretation. Will the Minister explain exactly what the phrase means? Surely, in preparing the report, the monitoring officer should consult all those who will eventually receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the consultation process with the two officers, the report should be examined by the chairman, the mayor, the lord mayor or the provost. There should be a link between elected members of an authority during the preparation of the report before it is sent to the council as a whole. For example, before the district audit service issues its audit report, it goes to certain members of the authority, such as the leader or the chairman of finance. It is only common courtesy that that occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that, under the Bill, any reports emanating from the monitoring officer will be controversial. For the sake of the dignity of the authority, as much as anything else, and to maintain a link between elected members and officers, the report should also be shown to the legal ceremonial head of the authority. The amendment seeks that the report be prepared in consultation with the chairman of the authority, not the leader or a committee chairman. That is a small concession for the Government to make in view of the relationships that could result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept and understand the way in which the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) supports the amendment. Does he accept, however, that his interpretation of the provision is foreign to what we had expected? It would be natural for reasons of co-ordination and of ensuring that all the information is available that the officers should consult others. It is proper to include such a provision in the Bill to ensure that there is no confusion and that people do not go off in one direction without having contacted their neighbours. That is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
The hon. Member for Torfaen is suggesting something else. His amendment would require consultation with the ceremonial head. That would be a different sort of consultation. The professional officers, in joint consultation, will produce a report that will often be a joint report. That will be presented to the council as a whole and not to individuals in the council, not even to the ceremonial head, although no doubt the ceremonial head will wish to make a contribution. It is important that there is a clear distinction between the officers' report and the council's action. The officers will do a professional job, and it is better to make that distinction. That is what the Bill sets out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee agrees—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my right hon. Friend's argument closely. He referred to the two professionals consulting to produce a joint report. What will happen if they cannot agree and the chief finance officer's perception is different from that of the chief executive or the monitoring officer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must consider occasions when remarkable things may happen. That problem may be solved by producing a report that is unanimous in the way that Widdicombe committee report was unanimous—it stated that there were two different ways of considering a specific issue. Another solution may be for each of the two officers to produce a report. Ultimately, the body that must consider the report is the council. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that in certain circumstances a report is laid before the council publicly to enable it to reach a conclusion on an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right to involve a representative of the elected council, be he ever so ceremonial in position, at the earlier of the two stages because that would blur the difference. There was a problem earlier in explaining to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) the distinction between the preparation of the statement and the council's action. It is important that there should be no blurring of the efforts of professional officers to present the case as they see it and subsequent action by the council. In the overwhelming number of cases I am sure that the report will be produced jointly, or perhaps individually, if the matter is not a financial one but a monitoring one, by the head of the professional service. It must be seen as an independent statement on what is happening. Under the chairmanship of the ceremonial head, the council will then have to assess the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that, even if not written into the Bill, in 99 per cent. of local authorities, whatever their political control, any report submitted by the monitoring officer will go to the ceremonial head and will be considered by the leaders of all the parties represented. The amendment would simply introduce recognition of the fact that local authorities are still elected by the people and run by elected members. The provision merely states

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
what officers may do. There should be some recognition of the importance of elected representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The officer will clearly perform their professional task. They will not decide whether the report will be accepted. They will not say that the council must decide this and someone else must do that. They will present a professional report to the council—in the same way that an auditor may present a report—and it will be for the council to make a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is any misunderstanding, the provision is designed to point out that the elected members make the decision. All that we are providing for is that they will have the opportunity to make that decision with the fullest professional advice in circumstances where the whole council rather than just a section of it can feel satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We must recognise that the relationship between officer and member is important. It cannot be imposed by law. When that relationship is soured, it is difficult to restore. It has already been said succinctly that the relationship between officer and officer is important, too, but it could be soured by the clause which is neither necessary nor advisable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 9, line 40, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and no person shall be disqualified from such office or employment on account of his entitlement to any pension.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to a restrictive practice that has shown itself in different parts of the county several times. It appears to be the policy of the National and Local Government Officers Association that applicants for local authority posts should not be offered a job if they have a pension. I am not sure of the rationale behind that policy, but it seems to be related to employment with a local authority being regarded as an extension of social services. In other words, under no circumstances should there be any redundancies. Similarly, recruitment should be on the basis of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter came to my notice when constituents, who were admirably qualified for employment with the city of Bradford metropolitan council—at that time Labour-controlled—were refused jobs with it. In more than one case, at interview applicants were told that the policy was by no means rigid, that it would be interpreted flexibly and that if no suitable applicant who had no pension was found, they would be offered the job. In fact, in all the cases brought to my notice the applicants, though admirably qualified, were rejected for employment with the authority and were later told that their applications had been rejected because they were entitled to pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One applicant was a naval officer who had taken early retirement at about 50; he applied for a post as a lecturer in physics. There is a shortage of physics lecturers. I believe that there were no other suitably qualified applicants, but because this man had a naval pension he was refused a post with the Bradford metropolitan council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second case involved a former police officer who applied for a position as a security officer. At the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
interview he was told that he had the job, subject to confirmation. A few days later he was telephoned by a rather embarrassed officer in the personnel department and told that he was disqualified because of his pension as a former police officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third example demonstrates the wide variety of cases that have come before me. A man with a very small pension—less than £10 per week—was living on social security benefit. That was reduced by the amount of his tiny pension. One would have thought that even if employment with the authority were seen as some kind of social service, this man—who after all was on social security—would have been offered a job and that the policy would have been sufficiently flexible to take account of his circumstances. Yet he, too, was refused a position because he was entitled to a pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took up these cases with the director of personnel. He and his fellow officers recognised that the policy was unfair to applicants and that it deprived the authority of the services of well-qualified applicants. I was told that the officials would recommend to members that the council should change its policy. Later it became apparent that the Labour majority group had closed ranks, apparently at the behest of NALGO, and refused to amend its policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the matter up with a Ministry of Defence Minister who told me that a number of local authorities—invariably controlled by the Labour party—followed the policy either rigidly or partially. The Ministry of Defence is apparently quite worried that the career opportunities of personnel leaving the services are restricted because they cannot obtain posts with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of the Bradford city council has changed, because there has been a welcome change of control. One of the first policy decisions of the new Conservative administration was to reverse that policy. But there are other authorities where it is no doubt still followed. The policy is a denial of justice and demands legal proscription. I do not know whether my amendment is the best way of altering the situation, but I hope that the Government will agree that action is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts forward a compelling case. I listened carefully to what he said, and I believe that there is a growing number of examples like those that he catalogued. I am more familiar with the examples involving members of the armed forces and police.

I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that the Bill is not the right vehicle for changing employment law. A dramatic change would be required because, as he accurately observed, it is not illegal for local authorities to carry on in the way that he described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It could be argued that the practice I described would be illegal under the provision. Lawyers could argue about that. I do not know how many lawyers there are in Committee, but I am anxious to avoid opportunities for lawyers to spend time before the courts clocking up the pennies. To avoid doubt, there may be a good case for incorporating in the clause a provision such as that in my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps my hon.

I am not entirely happy about the matter because we are concerned with local authority employment but this appeared to be a suitable opportunity to alter the law that applies to local authority employment. I am not aware that any other major employer practices a similar policy. Nevertheless, I accept that this may not be the best opportunity to press the matter, so I shall rest on the assurance given by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will be able to improve the law at an early date so that the many people who are in the same position as those of my constituents whose cases I sought to raise may be able to secure employment to the advantage of themselves and the local authorities that use their services.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had tabled amendment No. 86 but I understand that it was found not to be in order because it referred to a Government Department. However, I suggest to the Minister that it would be better if the clause contained wording about making appointments on merit as is outlined in our amendment. Even the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) might find that that was preferrable to the way in which he tries to get round the problems that crop up. Most local authorities have developed good policies on equal opportunities and employment on merit which are rapidly becoming models for other organisations and beginning to be widely praised. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should take account of the ideas behind amendment No. 86 in his review of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many local authorities consider only internal applicants for certain appointments. Under the previous administration in Bradford, preference was given to internal applicants for teaching posts and when the present chief executive of Bradford council was appointed, the council restricted its choice by announcing that it would only consider applications from people already employed by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to tell us how far the clause is intended to go. Does the fact that appointments are to be made on merit require local authorities to seek applications on an unrestricted basis? In other words, should local authorities be required to consider both external and internal applicants? My view is that the confinement of choice to internal applications only is a restrictive practice which is bad for local government because it does not allow the fertilisation from outside from which it would benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's remarks are sensible and they should be borne in mind by local authorities or anyone who may make appointments. However, the purpose of the clause goes wider than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
that and what is established in statute, for what I believe is the first time, is that appointments should be made according to merit. There is a fairly widespread feeling—it was mirrored by the Widdicombe committee—that that does not always happen. For example, in his characteristically elegant way, my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) pointed to a rather curious series of events in the London borough of Ealing. It is difficult to believe that decisions are made in a way that deserves public confidence. We wished to make it clear that whether local authority appointments were made by officers, members or officers and members they were to be made on the basis of merit. That is the purpose of the clause. I do not want to expand the explanation. I take on board what was said the by the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) but I am not sure that anything that he said would lead me to change the nature of the clause. If he wishes to put his arguments to me again on another occasion I shall be happy to listen to them, but they do not run contrary to the idea that the Committee ought to accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press my point, but I am not a lawyer and I do not understand exactly what the clause means. When we pass such legislation we should consider the sort of case that might arise. Does the clause apply only to the selection process—interviewing and appointment—or does it apply to the wider process of recruitment as a whole? When a local authority is considering advertising an appointment does it have to make it clear that considerations of merit will come before all others so that the fact that an applicant may not already work for the authority will not be allowed to get in the way of appointments on merit? Legal issues are involved, making the issue more complex than at first sight it would appear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am in the happy position of not being a lawyer, so I shall interpret the provision in the simple terms in which I understand it. It would be improper for a council to make an appointment on grounds other than those of merit. If a council decided to appoint only people with red hair or people with certain religious or political connections, so that someone of greater merit who was better suited to the job was not appointed, that would be in contravention of the clause. It would be difficult for me to rule on any hypothetical case that my hon. Friend might raise. I believe that it is a legal principle that one does not rule on hypothetical cases. If a local authority produced rules making it impossible to choose someone who was clearly more meritorious than those in line for the job, it would contravene the clause. My hon. Friend's objection would be covered, at least in part, by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At this late stage I do not wish to press the amendment. I simply say to the Minister that there must surely be a case for consultation about the standing order regulations that are so important to local authorities. To press ahead with the provision without consultation seems to be unnecessarily heavy-handed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reassure the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Hunt, I shall not press amendment No. 88, but will cover the subject on clause stand part. All that I am seeking is to make political vetting less bureaucratic. I wish to say something about political vetting during the clause stand part debate, so I shall leave amendment No. 88 now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 92, in page 11, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(f) the independent person referred to in subsection (3)(e) above shall be a person of such a description as is agreed following consultation with the local authority associations, relevant trade union and other representatives of local government as appear to the Secretary of State to be appropriate.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak now. I believe that the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) wishes to catch your eye, Mr. Hunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee for too long at this time of night, but before we finish with clause 8 I should like to see if it is as odd as I thought it was earlier in the day when I sought to table amendments to it. The turbo-charged rate at which we are proceeding made that impossible, but fortunately I can make my comments on this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
amendment. Clause 8(3)(e) may require a relevant authority's standing orders
	<br><blockquote><p>"to prohibit the authority or any committee, sub-committee or other person acting on their behalf from dismissing or taking other disciplinary action against a person holding office or employment under the authority except in accordance with recommendations contained in a report made to the authority by an independent person of such a description as is prescribed by the regulations."</p></blockquote>
That provision appears all-embracing. I find it hard to believe that that was the Government's intention. It would mean that no one could be dismissed without an independent report. That seems an onerous requirement and contradicts what the Minister said about his unwillingness to see current local authority powers in relation to their employees reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a number of examples to give to the Committee, but I shall use just one which may be appropriate to the Minister's interests. If an authority put services out to tender, the tender was won by an outside contractor, and he wished to use staff currently employed by the local authority, he would have to obtain an independent report on the employees before he could do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same would apply in other circumstances where staff were being dismissed. It seems unlikely that that is what was intended by the subsection. Perhaps I misunderstand it. Alternatively, perhaps the Minister put more into the clause than he intended. Many exceptions could be found, not least those relating to gross misconduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause gives a power to make the core standing orders, and it is proper for the Government to say how they would use the powers. We would seek to make core standing orders that would say that where councillors are involved in the sacking of an officer, that could be done only after an independent report from someone outside and the punishment could not be greater than that recommended by the report. That seems a reasonable provision if in normal circumstances sacking is not done by councillors, but by officers, except for those in top jobs. In some authorities, however, councillors become involved in activities of control of a sort that might make one unhappy. It is perfectly reasonable for them to do so, but not in a way that does not allow the independent report suggested in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not affect redundancy—the other point raised by the hon. Gentleman. The power would be used specifically to deal with circumstances where councillors sacked, or sought to sack or discipline somebody. In those circumstances there would be an independent report. That is not unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 midnight</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his explanation. I hope that at a later stage something to that effect could be included in the Bill. That would not seem impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify two matters? First, how would he expect to define councillors' involvement? They may express strong opinions which, in some circumstances, the officers may find difficult to ignore. Secondly, does this link in directly with earlier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
points about appeals for those who might come under the political restrictions that we discussed earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose is to protect the professional independence and integrity of officers. No doubt the hon. Gentleman and I take a similar view on that important matter. I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman has read the speech that I made to the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives some months ago in which I said that, in my view, one great defence of independence in local government was the professional integrity and independence of local government officers. Since my speech, I have received much support from local government officers on the matter. Last week, I repeated similar but extended views to the Local Government Training Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would ensure that if local government officers gave professional advice, which is perhaps unwelcome, to a local authority, councillors could not say, in effect, "We do not like your advice. Out!" The provision would ensure that local government officers were protected and did not feel cowed in that respect. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probably true that the provision would afford protection if there were an extreme or outrageous use of powers by councillors. Perhaps that helps the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The involvement of councillors relates to when they have taken part in the decision. I agree that there might be circumstances in which none took part but when pressure was involved. It is difficult to provide complete protection against that. In the event of unfair dismissal, for example, other courses would be open to the officers involved. Indeed, if it were demonstrated that councillors had taken part, this provision would come into effect. I agree with the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that sometimes it may be difficult to pinpoint such involvement, but I think that such occasions would be few and far between.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his detailed explanation. There is not much doubt in my mind about what he is attempting to do. I merely ask him to consider including the effect of his explanation in the Bill at a later stage. That would be helpful and not especially difficult to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 11, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(g) to require the monitoring officer of the authority from time to time to prepare a report to the authority in respect of the racial and gender composition of the workforce, and the employment of disabled persons by the authority, and in particular to show this composition in terms of:
	<ol>
	<li>grade or status;</li>
	<li>remuneration;</li>
	<li>part- and full-time employment;</li>
	<li>access to training provision by the authority.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I shall be brief, I do not wish to under-emphasise the importance of the issue, to which we may wish to return on the Floor of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
House. That is one advantage of not pressing the Government too hard tonight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 93 would require the monitoring officer to prepare a report on the race and sex composition of the work force and—this is especially important—the levels at which individuals operate. Local authorities, like some progressive companies, have taken the lead in monitoring the work force to ascertain how well they are combating sexual and racial discrimination. The Government should encourage that and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is either superfluous or remarkably inappropriate. There are statutory codes of practice which already apply, and clause 5 puts a duty on the monitoring officer to report any failure to comply with those codes. I strongly recommend the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 11, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(h) to require the monitoring officer of the authority to prepare a report to the authority identifying the number of council employees, by department, who are paid less than the Council of Europe's low pay threshold or any other such measure of low pay as may be specified by the Secretary of State in regulations.".</p></blockquote>
The comments that applied to amendment No. 93 apply to this amendment. A monitoring officer is to be appointed, and that will provide a marvellous opportunity to tackle low pay. The Government are way behind the rest of Europe and sooner or later Brussels will force them to comply with its social legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have views on the powers of the EEC. The Prime Minister may rant and rave but Brussels increasingly behaves as though it is the Government of Europe. Hon. Members must decide how far such protests are justified. Some of the EEC regulations and associated legislation will be imposed here whether the Government like it or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On most issues, we are at the bottom of the heap. Far from staging an impressive economic recovery, our progress has been extremely slow compared with other European regions. The richest regions in Britain are at best only the 10th richest in Europe, and at worst between 20th and 30th.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to do something about the low paid through the monitoring officer and I urge the Government to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to weary the Committee by explaining why that statement was a load of old rubbish. We have the largest number of new jobs in Europe and one of the fastest-growing economies, and at long last Britain is back to the position that she should hold rather than being a nation at the bottom of the heap, as she was when the Government came to power. That has been the great achievements of the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I yield to no one in my support for Europe. I am a fervent and devoted supporter of growing unity in Europe. Some things that Brussels says are sensible and some are stupid. A strong supporter of Europe can say that without mincing words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
The amendment suggests that we should remove negotiations about pay from their proper place between employers and employees and that instead a level should be set and monitored artificially. Pay is for the staff or their representatives to negotiate with management. It is sad that staff representatives in Britain have been less effective than their counterparts elsewhere because they have been too involved in politics and too little involved in protecting their members' interests. I hope that that is changing because of the Government's sensible trade union legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary and damaging. Individuals and their representatives should negotiate proper terms and conditions with local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that we do not agree. As usual, the facts are on my side and fantasy is on the side of the Minister. He knows that sooner or later Europe will insist on our proposal and that the Government will have to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to consider the political vetting aspect of the clause, which is so offensive. One of our amendments sought to restrict its bureaucratic impact, but the principle is more important. Clause 8(3)(c) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to require the monitoring officer of the authority to prepare a report to the authority in respect of every proposed appointment of a person to a politically restricted post".</p></blockquote>
That could have come straight out of Stalin's Soviet Union, Franco's Spain or from any of the sad dictatorships that are on their way out. At best, it introduces a bureaucrat who examine's people's political background to see whether they fit. At worst, an unelected person without public support will be able to say what is unacceptable. It is a straight case of political vetting and the Government should admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8(3)(e) prohibits dismissal or disciplinary action except in accordance with the recommendations of an independent person. That overrides the disciplinary procedure of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister waved his purple Filofax with pride and joy, saying, "This is what we have for local authorities," and now he is overriding it. He does not like his purple Filofax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision removes members' discretion, but members are ultimately responsible for staff and their decisions. When debating what Labour or Tory councils have done, we sometimes forget that the measures have been carried out by the staff. It is never right for elected members to attack or criticise staff unreasonably. Good councillors protect the decisions of their staff because they are responsible for recruiting them and for discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Minister must defend his staff, but he does not appoint them. He must not do so, because that would be a political involvement. Ministers take the rap for mistakes made by our staff,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
none of whom we appoint. The only appointments on which we have any say are those of the staff in our private office. We do not mind defending them because we know that they have been properly appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only thing that I can say to comfort the Minister's staff is that none of the Ministers at the Department of the Environment last long. They might survive for half a Bill, or even for a whole Bill, then at best they are moved and at worst sacked. I am looking forward to that record being maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made my case for me because local authorities make appointments. If he removed that power, he would bring local authorities into line with the Civil Service. That is why he is in a mess and why it is a mistake to compare the Civil Service with local authorities. They are not strictly comparable but if they are to be compared, it must be borne in mind that local authorities will continue to employ staff with councillors on the interviewing boards. If the Minister suggests that they should be removed, at least it would be logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about what will happen if there is disagreement between the independent person and the council. I do not know whose decision would be final.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 is unattractive. It has the worst features of political vetting and is a nasty, squalid move down the democratic scale. It further undermines the role of established local authorities—under the control of Labour, Tory, SLD or whatever other party—which have held their heads high at a time when the Government are continually undermining them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reason is deserting the hon. Members for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) and for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), as are their hon. Friends. The hon. Member for Hammersmith made uncharitable remarks about Ministers at the Department of the Environment. I hope that he remains in Opposition for ever and ever! I know that my hon. Friends support me in that desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says nothing that the hon. Member for Hammersmith suggests. It merely requires the monitoring officer to report whether an appointment would be legal and to consider whether it would contravene any enactment or involve an unreasonable decision. That is not political vetting. We have a uniform core of standing orders, which will lay down clear rules on how councils should take part in staffing decisions, appointments, disciplinary measures and dismissals. I recommend the Committee to support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
