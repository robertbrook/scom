	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin our deliberations I shall deal with the difficult subject of the Room. This week we have no particular problem because although this Room is not ideal, it is tolerable. I am advised that the parliamentary Labour party will not be holding its weekly celebrations on Thursday, so we shall meet in this Room as today. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] When we return after the recess I am determined to find a solution to the Thursday problem. It is unacceptable that the Committee considering the most important legislation of the year should be obliged to meet in intolerable conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may go to the Grand Committee Room for three sittings, pending negotiations to reach an agreement about where the two parliamentary parties hold their weekly meetings. I intend to discuss this matter with Mr. Speaker because it is not right that this Committee should have to take second place. We shall investigate all possibilities and do our best to ensure that the Committee meets in decent and seemly surroundings. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 28</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CHARGE AND RATES OF INCOME TAX FOR 1989–90</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause gives effect to the Chancellor's decision to make no change in the basic rate and higher rates of income tax this year. For 1989–90 the basic rate is therefore 25 per cent., the level to which it was reduced last year, and the higher rate is 40 per cent. Under the statutory indexation provisions, the level of taxable income above which the higher rate is charged goes up by £1,400 from £19,300 to £20,700.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear in his Budget statement on 14 March and in winding up the Budget debates on 20 March that this was a prudent and cautious Budget, which
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the firm support it gives to the defeat of inflation by monetary policy, provides a solid base for further economic success, including progress to a basic rate of income tax of 20p in the pound, in the years that lie ahead."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 March 1989; Vol. 149, c.823]</p></blockquote>
That remains our objective and I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 28, as the Financial Secretary said, enshrines the two rates at which income tax shall be charged on earned income during this financial year. We do not intend to divide the Committee on the clause, but it is relevant and important for us to express our misgivings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two criticisms of the two-rate structure that the Government are seeking to perpetuate. The first criticism is about the higher rate at 40p in the pound. Last year the Chancellor reduced all the higher rates to 40p in the pound. We criticised that decision at great length and with great ferocity last year because it was unfair and, in terms of the national economy, it was unwise. We have since been proved right on both counts. But at this juncture we wish to stress the unfairness argument because the Chancellor has deliberately decided not to put right any of the damage that he caused last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Higher earners benefit considerably from the 40p top rate of tax. Since 1979 the top 1 per cent. of earners in Britain have received a total of £26,000 million in income forgone by the Exchequer by means of top-rate tax cuts. The average of that 10-year windfall works out at about £100,000 per person. That is the extent of the gift given by the Government and the Chancellor. Last year's tax cuts and the proposals in clause 28 give wealthier individuals in Britain considerable annual benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction introduced last year gave to the top 1.1 per cent. of the population—those earnings above £50,000—a total benefit of £1,900 million. Therefore, 31.3 per cent. of the total benefit made available in last year's Budget went to 1.1 per cent. of the earning population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, at the bottom of the scale, people earning less than £5,000—who constitute not 1.1 per cent. but 12.2 per cent. of the taxpaying population—received not £1,900 million, but only £120 million. That is 2 per cent. of the overall benefit given in last year's Budget. Those figures show the manifest unfairness of what the Chancellor did last year and what he wishes to set in place this year. They show that 31 per cent. of the benefit went to 1 per cent. of the population, whereas at the bottom end of the spectrum, 2 per cent. of the benefit went to the bottom 12 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are more revealing when one considers the average gain per tax unit per week made after last year's Budget. If one earned over £50,000 a year, one gained £182 per week. If one earned less than £5,000 a year, one gained 92p per week. That starkly identifies the difference of approach taken by the Government to the two sections of earners. By setting the top rate of tax at 40p in the pound, they gave enormous sums to the rich and a few pence to the poor. That is not fair, just or a sensible tax policy. The Government are doing nothing to put that right this year. The Chancellor had the opportunity to make life much easier for people at the bottom of the income spectrum and a little tougher for those at the top.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), who appears to be reading from last year's brief, told us whether he intends to say anything original or whether we can switch off and prepare for later clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the rule were that hon. Members had to make original speeches, we should have fairly silent Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention was hardly original. It is obvious that neither the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) nor his colleagues are interested in the fairness of the tax system, which is at the heart of our debate on income tax. The hon. Gentleman is interested not in fairness but in the benefit that I am sure he and his friends are likely to receive again this year. Our criticisms may be the same but they are as valid, just and right as they were last year, and they bear repeating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the results of the tax changes has been that the percentage of income tax contributed by the top 1 per cent. and the top 5 per cent. of the population has risen steadily during the past 10 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument also has a familiar ring. The Financial Secretary perhaps put it in its clearest form on Second Reading. At the conclusion of his speech—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must wait. The answer is coming, but first I want to have a little fun at the expense of the Financial Secretary. At the conclusion of his speech he purported to claim that top-rate tax cuts were a means of clobbering the rich. That was his phrase. We now have a new definition of the Tory party. It claims fallaciously not only to be the party of low taxation but to be the party that clobbers the rich. I am sure that the rich would be extremely interested to hear that as they have done well in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's point. The answer is simple. In cash terms, and if growth in income is disregarded, of course the pattern identified by the hon. Gentleman may emerge. However, a study of the growth of income among the top 5 per cent. of the population not only shows that they contribute more in tax because they pay themselves more but reveals the widening gap between the rich and the poor. During the past 10 years incomes at the top of the spectrum have risen substantially faster than those at the bottom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the increase in cash terms in incomes at the top of the salary scale is largely due to the fact that people
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
no longer pay themselves in benefit in kind but in cash?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that as I struggled through the traffic jams to get to the House of Commons this morning, I noticed no diminution in the number of large company cars that executives in the City appear to have. Benefits in kind have continued. Major income tax advantages have been made available on top of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the outset that the Opposition have two principal criticisms of the structure that the Government are implementing in the clause. The first and sharpest of those criticisms relates to the overweening benefits which the Government make available to those at the top end of the income spectrum. Our other criticism is that the Government seem to believe that it is a virtue to have a single rate of tax of 25p in the pound for about 95 per cent. of the taxpaying population. We do not consider that a particularly progressive way of taxing income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth comparing for a moment the income tax structures in some other countries. In Japan the starting rate of tax is 10.5 per cent. and the top rate is 60 per cent. If the local income tax and the employee social insurance contributions are included, the top rate is 76 per cent. There are proposals to reduce that top rate to 65 per cent., but the spread will still be between 10.5 per cent. and 65 per cent. and in between there are 12 different bands at which income tax is charged. In contrast, this Government have a starting rate of 25p in the pound and a top rate of 40p in the pound, with no bands in between. As a result, Britain's starting rate of tax is one of the highest in the world. It is exceeded in only four other countries in the Western world. Our top rate of tax is one of the lowest in the world. If the social insurance contribution, which is an important factor that does not apply above the upper earnings limit, is included Britain's top rate of tax is the lowest in the world apart from one country—Switzerland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our starting rate of tax is higher than that in almost every other country and our finishing rate of tax is lower than that in almost any other country without any progressivity in between, and 95 per cent. of the population, whether they earn £4,000 or £20,000 a year, pay exactly the same rate of tax. The Opposition do not consider that to be a sensible or progressive way of organising our tax system. We have profound disagreements with the way in which the Government have handled income tax structures. We remain as powerfully opposed to the 40 per cent. top rate as we were last year. We deeply regret the failure of the Government, the Financial Secretary or the Chancellor to take the opportunity offered by this year's Finance Bill to put right the damage that they did last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith). I cannot pretend that what is about to follow is original either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
Once again, we ask the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to stop ducking the question that we ask every year and shall continue to ask. Why does he persist with such an unfair taxation system? How can it be justified? I suspect that if the Financial Secretary answered the question, it would be partly in terms of markets. There is the idea that people at the top earn more because they are worth more. That is a dubious argument, given that we do not have a perfect market, but a rigged market. The people at the top are paid more because they decide what they should be paid. They make those judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take a current example. At the BBC, Mr. Michael Checkland and Mr. John Birt do not wait to see what the market will pay in an annual pay round. Instead, they say to each other, "I think that you are worth this much". They make sure that they get their hands into the honey pot first. That happens in every company where the first duty of the ruling body is not to the shareholders. It happens in every company whose first duty is not to ensure that good products go to the customers. Instead, such companies ensure that their high earners are all right. The top of such companies is like a club. Once people are members of that club, it protects itself. Even when, over a year, a company is foully mismanaged and some people leave in near disgrace, settlements of more than £1 million—as in the case of Anthony Berry—are made to those who mismanaged it. The Chancellor takes no account of matters like that. He continues to support those who can already support themselves very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, a few years ago there was a case for giving fringe benefits to those high earners whose salaries had been kept down or who paid very high taxes. That would ensure that their insurance, health, cars, houses and holidays—or conferences—were taken care of by the firm. That could be justified then. It cannot be justified nowadays when the maximum rate of tax is 40p in the pound. We have clear evidence that that is a theoretical 40p in the pound, not an actual 40p in the pound because the Chancellor, while plugging some loopholes, opens up others so that people on high earnings pay no taxation whatever. The Chancellor fails to show how this system, where people with the highest income do not pay a fair rate of tax, has led to a trickle-down effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Commons Library has produced some dramatic figures showing the impact of 10 years of Tory Chancellors' Budgets. Single people receiving five times average earnings have had their taxation cut from 52.2 per cent. to 36.2 per cent. But single people on half average earnings have seen their taxation increase from 23 per cent. to 24 per cent. As for tax and national insurance contributions less child benefit for married couples with two children, the figures show that people on half average incomes, who were paying 2.4 per cent. of their income in taxation in 1978–79, are now paying 8 per cent., which is three times that amount. The taxation burden for married couples with two children, earning five times average earnings, taking their tax and national insurance contributions less child benefit as a percentage of earnings, has fallen from 48.8 per cent. to 34.2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
How can the Financial Secretary justify a taxation system which has increased the burden on the lowest levels of income, but which has dramatically reduced the burden on those earning five times the average income? It is unfair when one considers taxation alone; when one also takes account of the amount of income or quasi-income, which people on the top level of firms receive through payment that is not expressed in monetary terms, it is totally unjustifiable. The burden on people on low incomes becomes even worse because of the high rate of effective taxation that they experience, not only through the taxation system but because of the withdrawal of benefit. It should be the No. 1 priority of the Financial Secretary to correct that manifest unfairness. How does he justify it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said that the debate was essentially about fairness and efficiency. He rehearsed the arguments that we have debated fully on many occasions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) said, it sometimes seems as if we are debating last year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) seems to think that there is a great mystery in our justifying the top-rate tax cuts. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) gave a good answer when he said that the proportion of revenue paid by the top 5 per cent. of taxpayers has increased in real terms and as a percentage of income tax revenue. That alone is a good justification. The purpose of taxation is to raise revenue, not to punish people or gratify other people's sense of envy. The results speak for themselves: there has been no loss of revenue. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury puts that down to increases in salary. Part of it is, but that merely begs other questions: why have salaries, in turn, been increasing? Why has there been growth? Why are executives returning to this country from abroad? Those factors are contributing to our growth and to the buoyancy of tax revenues. They are our justification for the cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why was a £2 billion provision made in last year's Budget—it turned out not to be needed—for the supposed effects of the tax cuts for top-rate earners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Red Book last year assumed no behavioural changes. We debated that footnote at the time. On Second Reading, I pointed out that the proportion of revenue paid by the top 5 per cent. exceeded our expectations of last year. Already there has been a supply side effect from those top-rate cuts. There is nothing remotely to apologise for or to regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury mentioned Japan, which has talked about reforming its taxation system, although it now seems to have other matters on its mind. Many countries are moving towards a much simpler rate structure and much lower tax rates. It is not true that ours is the lowest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Financial Secretary saying that the figures in the Red Book last year were wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures in the Red Book last year were not wrong. As I explained, those figures stated clearly that they were based on the assumption of no behaviourism, which is the assumption of every forecast and projection of revenue in the Red Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was disappointing that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, who has been involved in the Opposition's rethink on tax policy, did not choose to reveal some details of the income tax structure that his party would propose. The hon. Gentleman said only that it is wrong to have a simple two-rate structure. He would prefer a multiplicity of rates and appeared to come close to repeating one point in the Labour party document. As he would expect, I have read that document several times and it says that a two-rate tax structure is practically a flat-rate system of income tax. That is absolute nonsense. With our system of allowances, it is possible to have a system of progressivity without having 11 bands, as we used to have, and 13 bands on unearned income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year a married man earning £100 a week will pay 4 per cent. of his income in income tax; on £250 a week he will pay 16.6 per cent.; and on £450 a week he will pay 20.3 per cent. The Opposition always think that tax should be higher, but by any standard, that is a progressive system of taxation and shows that people who earn more are paying more. Coincidentally, that point is made in this morning's edition of 	<i>The Independent,</i> in an article commenting on the Labour policy review. The article says that Mr. Dilnot, an economist with the Institute of Fiscal Studies, attacked the Labour party's
	<br><blockquote><p>"contention that the current tax system is not progressive. Furthermore, the introduction of a series of graduated tax bands instead of the present two rates would not make the system more progressive … Mr. Dilnot also emphasised that more other industrial countries were shifting towards simplified tax systems like Britain's."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Dilnot felt that that was perfectly compatible with a progressive system and with fairness. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre demonstrated, it certainly brings in the money and the revenue. That is why I stand by my remark of clobbering the rich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary says that other countries are moving towards Britain's position. He may be right in a marginal respect. Let us take the example of Italy. At present, Italy's bottom rate of tax is 12 per cent. and its top rate 62 per cent. It plans to reduce that top rate from 62 per cent. to 60 per cent. West Germany proposes to reduce its top rate of tax from 56 per cent. to 53 per cent. There are proposals for change, but I should hardly call those significant changes compared with the lengths to which this Government have gone and which they are perpetuating in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tax policies should not be determined simply by imitating other countries, although that idea loomed large in the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
Gentleman's calculations. However, he did not mention Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland or the United States, some of which have lower rates than we do. Several countries have hinted that they would like to lower their top rates of tax and simplify their systems. Some countries that the hon. Gentleman mentioned have proposals for tax reform. But that is not the point. The point is what is the best system, what raises revenue, and what works efficiently. On the evidence to date, there is no reason to believe that the decision to cut the top rate of tax was other than forward-looking and thoroughly beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury made the usual points about cash gains for the rich. Of course, he left out the fact that we have consistently cut the basic rate and raised allowances. Our record on allowances is far better than that of the Labour party when it was in power. Every time that we have cut the basic rate, we have done so in the teeth of opposition from the Labour party. Although it is easy to quote examples of large cash gains to individuals, when viewed in the aggregate, 70 per cent. of the cost of tax cuts since 1979 has gone in cutting the basic rate and in increasing allowances. That shows that we are interested in cutting income tax for everyone. That is why we are committed to getting the basic rate lower than 25p. And we shall achieve it.

I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Financial Secretary get away with his description of the top rate of 40p in the pound as forward-looking. He attempted to defend the present tax structure in the clause as progressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can best put the argument by asking two, direct, rhetorical questions. Is it true that by reducing the top rate of tax to 40p in the pound, 31 per cent. of the entire benefit of that change will go to the top 1 per cent. of the taxpaying population?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is that it is correct, because the information was given by the Government in a parliamentary answer last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, can we conclude, as the majority of people in this country have concluded, that the Conservative party has perpetually redistributed wealth from the poor to the rich?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is about to claim that redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich is a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that he may have drawn the wrong conclusion? Since this Government came to power more than 2 million extra people have become homeowners. They are not

	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
at the top end of the range, but at the bottom. If calculations are based on the total wealth, it is found that 2 million at the bottom end of the range will increase wealth much more than a small number at the top end of the range.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confused between wealth and income and between the 2 million homeowners and the many more millions of people to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner) referred, who have not had their fair share of the improvements dished out by the Government to those at the top end of the spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have asked a second rhetorical question. I wanted the Financial Secretary to confirm whether it was true that in the past 10 years, including the changes that this Budget has enshrined, a married couple receiving half average earnings and with two children have seen their overall tax burden rise from 2.5 per cent. to 6.1 per cent. of their income. At the same time, a married couple receiving ten times average earnings and also with two children have seen their tax burden fall from 65.6 per cent. to 36.1 per cent. of their income. From those figures, it is clear what has happened under this Government. Those on half average earnings—the poorest end of the earnings population—have had their tax burden trebled. Those at the top end—those earning 10 times the average—have had their tax burden halved. We cannot possibly accept the Financial Secretary's claim that that is progressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of the Ways and Means resolution we cannot amend the clause in order to increase the burden of tax on the highest paid. Ideally, that is what we should like to do. That option is not available to us, so we shall not divide the Committee. However, we wished to place on record our distaste for the Government's policy and the obscenity of giving so much to the relatively few at the top end of the earnings scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>AGE ALLOWANCE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause has two purposes. First, it extends the higher level of age allowance previously given to those aged 80 and over and on modest incomes to elderly people aged 75 and over. For many years the system has provided an additional measure of relief for older taxpayers in recognition of the increased cost of living associated with old age. In the Finance Act 1987 we introduced a higher level of allowance for those aged 80 and over, recognising that advancing age brings with it increasing needs due to reduced mobility and failing health. The measure was widely welcomed and received the support of hon. Members on both sides
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
of the House. The age allowances are being increased this year in line with indexation. But we are now proposing to extend the higher level of allowance to those aged 75 and over. The reduction in the qualifying age matches the new social security provision for those aged 75 and over on low incomes which will take effect in October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the clause reduces the rate at which the excess of the age allowance over the corresponding basic married man's or single person's allowance is withdrawn when a person's total income exceeds the income limit. That point concerned many people, including my hon. Friends, after last year's Budget. We have been able to reduce the rate of withdrawal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989–90 the higher level of age allowance will be £5,565 for a married couple and £3,540 for a single person. About 400,000 single people and married couples are expected to benefit from the extension of the higher level and about 15,000 will be taken out of tax altogether. As a result of the reduction in the age allowance withdrawal rate, elderly households will benefit from age allowance up to higher income levels—£13,420 for a married couple and £12,630 for a single person aged 65 to 74. Some 120,000 elderly households whose total incomes lie within the withdrawal band will see their marginal rate reduced from 41 and two thirds to 37 and a half per cent. This meets a large number of representations that have been made by my hon. Friends and I am sure that it will be welcomed by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We very much welcome the clause and support the Government in introducing the change. We particularly welcome the reduction in the age qualification for the age allowance from 80 to 75, and the amelioration of the reduction rule also seems to be sensible. So that we may make progress, the only other comment that I shall make is that we wish that the Government would recognise the additional needs of elderly pensioners over the age of 75 other than through the tax system. They do not recognise those needs through what they provide in, for example, basic pension, and a few changes have rather hastily come forward only since the Chancellor's off-the-record suggestions to journalists. However, we heartily approve of this change under clause 29, and we wish to speed it well on its way into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause, and this may be an opportune moment to ask the Government to look in advance at a matter that I hope to raise later in a new clause. An increasing number of elderly people, because they are not liable to tax, will nevertheless find themselves paying a considerable amount of tax because of the composite rate system—unless their small amount of capital is fully committed to national savings, which is just about the only place where they can get the interest paid free of tax directly to them. Many elderly people who have accumulated a small amount of capital feel increasingly penalised because there are so many ways in which the possession of a small amount of capital is the barrier to any help with rates, rent or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
other state benefits. The clause will be welcome to them because of the additional tax relief that it brings, but it is only one of a number of ways that we should be looking at to ease the position of people who feel strongly that they have worked hard, saved and tried not to make themselves a burden on the state yet sometimes find that their thrift seems not to be appreciated. Indeed, it is a source of penalty to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(14) Each of the substituted figures in (2) to (13) above shall be increased by £100, except for individuals whose total reliefs, allowances and offsets for the year (without taking account of relief under this subsection) exceed £10,000."</p></blockquote>
If the memory of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) is as acute as he claims it to be, he may recognise some elements of the amendment because we tabled a similar amendment to the Finance Bill last year. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) had an extremely good time attacking the Government as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled the amendment in this form from a desire to comply with the rules of the Committee and to assist our discussions. Our ideal amendment would have been amendment No. 182, which I appreciate you, Mr. Cormack, were unable to select. It relates to a limit on reliefs and allowances that any individual could claim in totality. However, if it had been the only amendment that we had tabled, we could not have had a discussion on the principle of limiting overall reliefs and allowances. Amendment No. 185 enables us to have such a discussion, although it is not an ideal representation of our
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
position. It seeks to increase the personal allowances itemised in clause 31 but provides that the increase shall not be available to any person whose overall reliefs and allowances total more than £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We chose £10,000 because we regard it as a reasonable figure which provides considerable flexibility for individual taxpayers claiming reliefs and allowances. It may be recalled from our discussions of last year that the hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) made an entirely erroneous assumption when he confused the figure for relief that is dealt with in the amendment with that for mortgage tax relief on a limit of £30,000. The total amount of relief that a taxpayer can get, which is on the interest on his mortgage payments and not on the overall mortgage figure, is much less than £30,000. Indeed, in the case of a top rate taxpayer it would probably be about £2,500 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks entirely hypothetical questions. Doubtless, he will find extremely valuable and interesting reading in the document that has been mentioned—"Meet the Challenge Make the Change". It deals specifically with the point to which the hon. Gentleman referred. We make no secret of the fact that we wish to restrict mortgage relief to the basic rate of tax. We said so clearly in the debate on last year's Budget and we say so again now. The question about what would happen to top rate taxpayers if the top tax rate rose beyond 40p in the pound does not arise.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman says that interest relief on mortgages should be confined to the basic rate of tax does he mean the bottom rate as suggested in his party's policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
allowances to the basic rate. I understand that the Labour party claims that the same could be achieved by converting the main personal allowances into a zero rate tax band. So far as I can see a zero rate tax band would have precisely the same effect as personal allowances. I do not understand how the Labour party intends to increase the zero rate band without the effect rippling up through the system. Will the hon. Gentleman explain the plan? I assure him that far from considering them hypothetical questions, the whole country is deeply interested in such details. We want to hear what the hon. Gentleman can tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must pay closer attention to what is said in the Labour party policy review document. We make it plain that one of our criticisms of the system of personal allowances is that effectively taxpayers can offset such allowances against their highest rate of tax. We do not believe that that is fair. We do not believe that the personal allowance should be worth considerably more to the high earner than it is to the average earner. There is no justice in such a system. By opting for a different system incorporating a zero rate tax band the problem is avoided. Whether particular individuals gain or lose will depend on where the thresholds for each band are set, but as a whole the system would be much more sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can return to the amendment. The discussion has ranged rather widely. I am always delighted to debate the excellent proposals in the economic equality section of our policy review document with Conservative Members, but it would help our deliberations on the Bill if we concentrated on the amendment in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to limit the total amount of reliefs and allowances that individuals can claim. That is necessary because some taxpayers, whom no one would describe as being in need of assistance from the Exchequer, seem able to claim such an enormous range of reliefs and allowances as almost to eliminate their liability to tax altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going into detail about the need for such a limit, it is worth noting that the increase in personal allowances that the Government are proposing in the clause is the bare minimum by which they can raise allowances under Rooker-Wise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rooker-Wise formula lays down that the increase in basic personal allowances should be tied as a minimum to the increase in inflation during the previous year. In 1988 that was 6.8 per cent. and the Government have used that figure to increase personal allowances in the clause. That is considerably below the rate of inflation that pertained on Budget day and even further below the rate that pertains now. The figures published last week showed that the retail price index is currently increasing by 8 per cent. per annum. The tax and price index, which the Government used to consider a better indicator of what was happening to people's income and spending patterns, is increasing by even more per annum, and yet personal allowances are being
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
raised by substantially below the current overall rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Unit estimates that about 150,000 people who were not paying tax in the previous financial year will now be brought into tax in this financial year. The system sets allowances at a level where more people will pay tax than paid tax last year. People at the bottom end of the earnings scale who paid no tax last year will pay a tax bill this year. I suspect that the Government should have thought again about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our criticism is partly directed at the level of personal allowances, but also at the overall limit on the total reliefs and allowances that a taxpayer can claim. Why should such a limit be placed? I direct the attention of Conservative Members to the now-famous parliamentary question put last year by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) about the tax liability of a person earning £1 million a year who invests in property in enterprise zones, who takes advantage of business expansion scheme proposals, his full entitlement to mortgage tax relief and personal pension relief, and invests in forestry development. That question revealed that it was possible for someone earning £1 million a year to pay no tax whatsoever. The Financial Secretary, when asked to give the tax liability of such a person, said nil. The only thing that has changed since last year is the removal—except for transitional provisions—of the investment provision in forestry. Everything else has remained the same as when that question was answered. If one arranges one's financial affairs in a certain way, it is still possible to earn £1 million and pay no tax. That is not right; there should be a limit on the total reliefs and allowances that an individual can claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously approves of the activities in which this person would be involved. I hardly think that investing, in for example, a business expansion scheme of privately rented accommodation at high rents and high insecurity for tenants, is a virtuous way of investing one's money, but that is how such a taxpayer would shelter his or her income. That is spelt out clearly in the now equally famous advertisement that appeared in 	<i>The Times</i> on 25 February 1989. In special recognition of Conservative Member's interest in the matter, I had that advertisement blown up to large print, so that they would be able to read the top portion of the advertisement which says:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have not intervened at an inconvenient moment, but in relation to the hon. Gentleman's proposals for a limit on total relief, can he tell the Committee what would be the marginal

	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to believe that the hon. Gentleman is serious. I thought that the argument from the Government Front Bench over the past 15 months was that the top rate of tax of 40p in the pound removed the necessity to claim reliefs and allowances over and above a modicum, and that that top rate would keep people in the country. That, of course, is total nonsense but the Government Front Bench claimed that the rate of tax was important, not the availability of reliefs and allowances. Now the hon. Gentleman says the opposite—that the reliefs and allowances are important, not the basic and higher rates of tax. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to think carefully about what he said. Such interventions are never inconvenient because they assist our argument on every occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that the question to which I still await an answer was, what would be the marginal rate? One of the reasons for the Government's concern, which I share, is that there should be a sensibly modulated level of taxation so that no excess amount is taken off at any one point. That is the point which the hon. Gentleman is assisting me to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that the marginal rate of tax, which is the actual rate charged on an extra pound of income above the upper limit that we seek to set for a top rate taxpayer, would be 40 per cent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be confusing marginal rates with average rates.

The Peter Fletcher in the advertisement might not exist, but I am sure that they are many like him who take
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
advantage of the loopholes and devices of this patron of assumed character to limit their tax liability. The advertisement states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Peter Fletcher is a successful entrepreneur who will earn £200,000 in this tax year. Last year his tax bill was a frightening £105,000+. This year Peter will pay nothing at all."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative members must understand that I am using a fictional example to demonstrate a point. The advertisement reveals not that Peter Fletcher exists—I accept that he does not—but that the system of tax reliefs and allowances allows a person like Peter Fletcher to pay no tax. Conservative Members clearly think that it is right that someone earning £200,000 a year can pay no tax at all. They obviously do not like it, so I shall continue to spell out to them how such a person could exist and could use all these devices, reliefs and allowances to ensure that he pays no tax at all.

The advertisement says:

I give the Government credit for one thing: they have tightened up that aspect in the last couple of months through the clause that we have already debated on close company structures and business expansion schemes. Nevertheless, the possibility of investment in enterprise zone property and business expansion schemes still exists. A person earning £200,000 a year could still use them to offset all his or her tax liability. That possibility and that reality exist for taxpayers in this country and we do not think that it is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Secondly, the words "brain drain" became common currency in this country during the periods of high taxation on the wealthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to respond to the hon. Gentleman by observing that if the brain drain occurred, he is an example of what was left behind, but that would be uncharitable so I will not. The hon. Gentleman made exactly the same point as the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) made an hour or so ago. We answered it then and it is not necessary to answer it again. I simply take the hon. Gentleman up on his assumption that this arrangement of reliefs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
and allowances that Johnson Fry are putting before us in this advertisement is somehow just on the margins of possibility. Johnson Fry does not think so. It has been marketing its services for those sort of arrangements aggressively in the past 12 months. Many thousands of people took up their offers. The advertisement quotes Charles Fry, the chairman of Johnson Fry, as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All higher rate tax payers should be examining BES and Enterprise Zones very closely."</p></blockquote>
The basic principle that we are trying to enshrine through the amendment is that it is not right, fair or just for higher rate taxpayers to be able to shelter either all or a high proportion of their income from tax. Of course, we accept that it is perfectly in order for an individual to claim mortgage interest tax relief, personal allowances, personal pension reliefs and perhaps even, because we have been generous in setting the overall limit at £10,000, to put a little investment into one of the few decent business expansion scheme ventures that are under way. Beyond that, reliefs and allowances should not be used to shelter wealthy people's income. That is what is happening on a large scale at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United States, there are provisions for minimum tax to be paid by all taxpayers, no matter how many reliefs, allowances and tax shelters they attempt to engineer for themselves. In the same way, we believe that in this country there should be an overall limit on the total reliefs that any taxpayer can claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the overwhelming majority of ordinary taxpayers, it is pay as you earn. But for those well-heeled people with good accountants using every device in the book, it is pay if you like. That is not right, and the amendment would go some way towards ending this state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) made an interesting speech. He covered much of the ground that we covered in our identical debate on an identical amendment last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not a little less coy about the Labour party's tax plans. I shall study closely what he said about the zero rate band. It did not seem to make sense. If the width of the zero rate band is increased, that must inevitably raise the income level at which the higher rates start to bite. It does not follow that just by having a zero rate band instead of allowances would somehow stop the effect of the increase of whatever he called it rippling through to higher rate payers. I am not saying that there are not ways of doing that, but those ways have not been identified in the Labour party's document. I hope that the Labour party will work out its proposals in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Gentleman came on to his main argument—his advocacy of a minimum level of tax and limiting the use of shelters—he talked about allowances and numbers of taxpayers. We touched on that issue in a previous debate. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the married man's allowance remains at its highest level for nearly half a century.
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
There will be one and three quarter million fewer taxpayers in 1989–90 compared with the indexed 1978–79 tax regime. Therefore, our record in taking people out of tax is good. There is an enormous contrast with what happened between 1973–74 and 1978–79, when the value of personal allowances went down. The married man's allowance fell by 5 per cent. in real termns, and the single person's allowance—one can hardly believe it—fell by more than 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make those remarks in passing, because the hon. Gentleman's real argument concerned the execessive use, as he saw it, of specific tax reliefs. He talked about the Johnson Fry advert. He seems to think that many people do not pay the top rate of tax. I do not know why that view is held so firmly by members of the Labour party. They believe that hordes of top rate payers do not pay the top rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Leader of the Opposition was asked at a recent press conference—I know that it was not a Garrick club lunch—whether he thought that there had been a disincentive effect of the high rates of tax under the Labour Government, he replied that nobody had paid those top rates of tax. He could not have been more wrong. In 1978–79, 33,000 people paid 83 per cent., 36,000 people paid 75 per cent., and 32,000 paid 70 per cent. There is no evidence that people can evade on a large scale in the way that Opposition Members were describing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979, we have extended reliefs that serve a specific purpose, such as an economically useful purpose—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Gentlemen laugh, but there is overwhelming evidence that the business expansion scheme has had a beneficial effect in helping small businesses. Until recently, the Leader of the Opposition agreed with us; each year he welcomed our extensions of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members really think that the tax breaks are overused, the answer is simply not to have them. We could say that we do not want people to invest in rented accommodation, that we shall not allow tax relief to help small businesses, and that we are not interested in establishing workshops and warehouses in enterprise zones. That seems to be the logical way to approach the problem, rather than building up a complex measure to limit everybody to a basket of relief. Although that basket of relief may limit the use that is made of the tax breaks that I have mentioned, it would not affect the more technical tax avoidance devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We make no apology for schemes such as the business expansion scheme or the tax relief available for people to invest in enterprise zones, because we feel that they serve a purpose. The hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) strongly disagrees with that and made his views clear in an article in 	<i>Accountancy Age</i> the day after the Budget. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Up to £60 million a year has been lost to the Exchequer in the tax shelter schemes in some of the poorest areas of the UK."</p></blockquote>
He seems to think that the money was taken away from the poorest areas of the UK. I should have thought that the schemes resulted in putting money into the poorest areas. The hon. Gentleman then said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"By acquiring property in officially designated enterprise zones, taxpayers can now enjoy tax avoidance opportunities formerly available only in such places as Panama and the Channel Islands."</p></blockquote>
It is good that people invest their money in enterprise zone areas and rundown, derelict areas in this country—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Gentlemen scoff and laugh. I shall spare their blushes by not revealing the names of those Opposition Members who write to the Department of Trade and Industry asking to have enterprise zones in their constituencies. I do not accuse the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury of asking for one in his constituency. However, plenty of Opposition Members are anxious to have enterprise zones in their constituencies because they think that they affect economic activity in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that regional development grant, which the Government abolished, was far more cost-effective in terms of cost per job than the enterprise zones which the Government currently subsidise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been told many times that the business expansion scheme and the enterprise zones are not intended as employment measures. They are designed to increase investment in and the economic attractiveness of certain areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the effect of enterprise zones is not to switch investment from Panama to the enterprise zone, but all too often to switch investment from just outside the enterprise zone to inside the enterprise zone, so that the community does not benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. It is not borne out by the studies that have been done on enterprise zones. Obviously, there are problems when any area is designated for assistance. That applies equally to regional aid, of which the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East is such a strong supporter. That argument applies always whenever an area is designated for tax incentives. There are always border effects and that applies even more to the policies that the hon. Gentleman supports so strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people feel that excessive use is made of tax shelters, the answer is to deal with those directly, as we dealt with the forestry tax loophole that existed for years under the Labour Government, with umbrella offshore funds and with the accrued income scheme, We also made it more difficult for people to convert income into capital.

In last year's Finance Bill we closed loopholes and tax avoidance devices to the value of £800 million. We did not get much applause from the Opposition for that. We also dealt with non-charitable covenants. We took such action while maintaining specific tax incentives, which we think serve a useful purpose. Opposition Members have favoured tax breaks in the past for particular purposes. When I was in the Department of Trade and Industry, every week I had
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
to listen to them pressing for tax breaks for the film industry. We were most reluctant to agree to that because nothing has been more abused by high-rate taxpayers than investing in films.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have in front of me that quarterly economic survey of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. It is striking that it says that Wales, East Anglia and Yorkshire are not keeping up with the rest of the country. The Government have yet to explain the rationale behind the business expansion scheme when all the evidence demonstrates that it is not getting the jobs, the manufacturing, or the service industries to the regions that need them, but is reinforcing the stronger economy in the south-east. How can the Financial Secretary justify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a very full debate on the business expansion scheme in which the hon. Gentleman made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to the Johnson Fry advertisement, "High earner pays no tax." I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having had that enlarged. When I first saw the shrunken version, my immediate reaction was that Peter Fletcher bore an astonishing resemblance to the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury. We are all moving into the world of advertising agencies these days, so I did not know what the Opposition had been up to. Opposition Members have been obsessed with that advertisement and with the idea that some people might exploit tax breaks to the extent that they pay no tax. My hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Dover (Mr. Shaw) made effective interventions. My Hon. Friend for Stamford and Spalding said that it was difficult to understand what that person would live off if he had written off all his tax in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that the two Fletchers—Michael and Peter—in the advertisement are fictitious, and I do not believe that a significant number of people are in that position. If they were, the answer would be for Opposition Members to make clear their policy on specific tax breaks. That is the way to deal with that—not to introduce a plethora of controls. When the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury listed the tax breaks that contributed to a zero tax bill, he included personal pension contributions. I hope that the basket of relief in the Labour party's new tax policy will not infringe the tax reliefs for personal pensions. That would be an extremely retrograde and damaging course. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will make it clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to amendment No. 182, which has not been selected. It is our preferred alternative to the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the amendment says, but I also know what the hon. Gentleman said a few

moments ago. He mentioned personal pensions and I assume that he will stick by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have not made out a convincing case for the amendment. The wiping out of tax bills that they mentioned is not occurring on a significant scale. Furthermore, as I pointed out on the Floor of the House, for a person to reduce his tax bill, in theory, to zero would have been possible under the tax incentives given by the previous Labour Government. Opposition Members have pointed to 100 per cent. capital allowances in enterprise zones. When the Labour party was in Government 100 per cent. capital allowances were available throughout the country and several leasing arrangements were in force, whereby business men, rich individuals and people in the entertainment industry used capital allowances in conjunction with leasing deals to reduce their tax dramatically. It would have been possible to have had a nil tax rate then and I never heard Opposition Members complaining about that. At the time, they took the view that the incentive was worthwhile and were not worried about peripheral matters such as the advertisement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that under his policies it is still possible to earn £1 million a year and pay no income tax and that he intends to do nothing about it? Yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been possible since time immemorial—ever since there were capital allowances. It is probably a little more difficult now, in that capital allowances of 100 per cent. are now restricted to enterprise zones. It is not possible in the business expansion scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no problem that needs to be dealt with in the way that Opposition Members have recommended. I advise my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot accept what the Financial Secretary said. His closing remarks were important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, first, that the Government accept that it is possible for a person to earn £1 million a year and to pay no tax. The Governmnent have accepted that that is a possibility under their imposed tax system. Secondly, the Government do not think that it is right to do anything about it. We do not take that view. We believe that that possibility should be removed and that is why we tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may trespass briefly on your patience, Mr. Cormack, may I put the Financial Secretary right on a minor historical point? We were debating the film industry when he was a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry; indeed, I was a Back-Bench member of that Committee. In those days we were not asking for tax breaks for the film industry but for direct assistance from the Government to replace the Eady levy, which was at that time being removed. I hope that the Financial Secretary will read the reports of those debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic point is that it is possible to earn £1 million a year and pay no tax: Johnson Fry has found ways of doing it and my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 34</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SCHEDULE E: REVISED CASES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With clauses 34 to 42, we come to the part of the Bill which deals with the schedule E receipts basis of taxation. Clause 34 paves the way, and I shall briefly outline what it does. With your permission, Mr. Cormack, I shall elaborate a little on clause 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 34 establishes whether earnings are within the three Cases of schedule E. It is then necessary to determine for which year they are to be assessed. In the existing legislation, the rules which determine under which Case earnings are chargeable and the year for which they are to be assessed are intermingled. In the new legislation those two matters are dealt with in separate provisions. Clause 34 restates the Cases of schedule E determining what earnings are chargeable; clause 35 determines the year for which they are to be assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So this clause retains almost exactly the same rules for determining what earnings are chargeable to tax as exist now. At present, the residence and domicile status of the employee when he earns his pay is critical in determining whether all the earnings are chargeable, whether the charge extends only to earnings for duties performed in the United Kingdom or whether there is a charge on foreign earnings but only so far as they are received in the United Kingdom. Under the new receipts basis, it will still be the residence and domicile status of the employee when the pay is earned which determines the extent to which that pay is chargeable to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before referring to one technical respect in which clause 34 changes the rules, I want to make clear what is the effect of the change in the basis of
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
assessment. It is not a part of the new receipts basis proposals that the nature of the income charged to tax under schedule E should change in any way. It will not be the residence status of the employee in the year of receipt which determines what earnings are chargeable; that will still be determined by his status in the year in which they are earned. Once a charge on earnings is established under one of the Cases, those earnings will be assessed for the year in which they are received unless the charge is under Case III, in which case they will be assessed, as now, for the year in which they are received in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is one exception: The clause introduces a small change in the scope of the charge under schedule E. In the recent House of Lords decision in the case of Bray 	<i>v.</i> Best it was held that, in certain exceptional circumstances, earnings could not be taxed when they came from an employment which ended in an earlier tax year. This was because, on the unusual facts of that case, the earnings could not be attributed to any year when the employee held the employment. The main rule in subsection (2) does not deal with that situation because it provides that the employee must hold the office or employment in the year for which earnings are due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) therefore provides a supplementary rule which removes the gap exposed by Bray 	<i>v.</i> Best. That point is an exception; the clause simply restates for the purpose of the receipts basis the three cases of schedule E.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient for the Committee if I say that after making a few remarks on clause 34, the Opposition would like the main debate to take place on the amendments that we have tabled to clause 35. The clauses are related; some Government amendments are being debated together, although they are to separate clauses. It would make a nonsense of the discussion if we had the debate on a clause-by-clause basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This topic may not be the most exciting part of the Finance Bill, but I shall do my best to make it interesting. Some considerably significant matters are concealed herein. The proposals will make little difference to PAYE taxpayers. Company directors and others who do not pay as they earn will be more significantly affected. The proposals should be broadly welcomed. The idea of taxing on a received rather than earned income basis has much to commend it. It simplifies the present position, adds clarity and, I hope—although only time will tell—avoids delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary referred to the Bray 	<i>v.</i> Best judgment. I understand that clause 34 takes out the effect of that judgment, at least for the future. The Financial Secretary said that the judgment was unusual because of the unusual facts. He was not criticising the judiciary, but said that the facts of the case were unusual. That may be so, but the implications may be more wide reaching, and could have created quite a little seam for the tax avoidance industry. We welcome the fact that the seam is being blocked up before it had begun to be mined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
The transitional arrangements that go with this raft of clauses are less welcome. I am willing to be corrected on technical points by the Financial Secretary, but we understand that over the transitional period, it will be possible to create a Bray 	<i>v.</i> Best lacuna—a sort of black hole—in which Revenue could lose £80 million in year one and £60 million in year two. I am not sure why it is necessary to make the transition in such a way that temporary tax avoidance potential arises. The Labour party does not think that those who can take advantage of the system should be taxed twice, but want them to be taxed once. There may be an administrative reason why it arises, but it is hard to see what it could be. I shall say more about that when we debate our amendment, which is designed specifically to block such a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary referred to residency and I paid careful attention to his remarks. Has he considered the possibility—I put it no stronger—that some people will re-examine the advantages of living offshore and of being resident in the British Isles for only a limited period? Can he forecast whether the proposals would encourage such an avoidance route?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the transitional arrangements in the debate on clause 36. There must be such arrangements to ensure that when one moves from the old basis to the new basis some income is not taxed twice and some is not taxed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why there is an initial cost arises largely from the ending of the accounts basis, which is a non-statutory alternative to the earnings basis that we shall discuss later. The figures cited by the hon. Gentleman are right, but they are front-end costs. At the end of the transition there will be a real gain to the Revenue of £50 million each year, so, in a sense, this is a cash flow change. We will debate the transitional arrangements, but there have been criticisms of them which we may have to discuss. However, I am absolutely certain that there must be transitional arrangements.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can take a clear hint, Mr. Cormack. The list of amendments was made available this morning—I understand that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is working from that list, too. There must have been some changes since then. Having moved my amendment may I make my main speech on it later, having heard what the Government have to say about their amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is the major introduction of a significant simplification, but like many simplifications it seems exceedingly complex. It is a change to a simpler basis of assessment for earnings. From 6 April 1989 the earnings of employees and directors will be assessed for the year in which they are received instead of for the year for which they are earned. Most employees, as was said on the previous clause, do not receive an income tax assessment. Tax deducted from their paye under PAYE is near enough to the correct amount payable. No further action is needed. Even when assessment is necessary it is normally the earnings paid during the year that are assessed, because what is earned and what is paid are the same. So the vast majority of employees are already, in practice, taxed on a receipts basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the virtues of our proposal is that in practice it alters the treatment of only a small minority of employees and directors—about half a million people who regularly receive part of their pay some time after the year in which it was earned. They will now be dealt with on the same basis as in practice applies to all other employees. The pay assessed for the year will be the pay received in the year and the pay from which PAYE has been deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of the change in the basis of assessment has been fairly widely welcomed. That is not surprising, considering the complexity and delay that can occur under the present system. The new receipts basis of assessment—that is, taxing people when they receive their earnings—will put an end to much confusion and complexity. All employees will know how much they have received during the tax year almost as soon as it ends so it will be possible to complete returns much sooner. Because the earnings
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
from which PAYE is deducted during the year will be the earnings assessable for that year, fewer taxpayers will need assessments. That must mean compliance savings for the taxpayers concerned as well as significant staff savings in the longer term in the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reduce the delay which the strict earnings basis causes, some cases have, by agreement between taxpayer and tax office, been assessed on a non-statutory "accounts basis". Under that basis the directors' earnings for the company's accounting period ending in the tax year are taken as the earnings for that year. That reduces the delay in knowing what income to assess, but technical underpayments arising from unpaid earnings occur under that basis in the same way as under the statutory basis. That is, earnings of the accounting period may not have been paid by the following 5 April. Hence the income is assessable, but PAYE has not yet been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other drawbacks. Special rules are needed when the accounts basis is adopted at the start of the source of income. That often results in earnings for a period being assessed twice, and when the source of income ceases, there are further special provisions which result in earnings for a similar period not being assessed at all. This non-statutory basis has existed for a very long time and its very existence shows how complex and unsatisfactory the present earnings basis is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another defect with the accounts basis. When it was introduced, the amount not assessed on cessation probably differed little from the amount doubly charged at the outset. But in more recent times, with increasing levels of profits and earnings, that is unlikely to be the case and a significant amount of the earnings over the life of the employment in some cases may not be taxed at all. This will no longer happen under the new receipts basis and it is estimated that once the transition is complete as much as £50 million extra tax will be payable annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the transitional cost, which is, as he said, £80 million in 1989–90 and £60 million in 1990–91. Those costs arise mainly from the ending of the accounts basis of assessment on the transition to the new receipts basis. Some income will not be assessable under either the old accounts basis or the new receipts basis. Income which relates to the period between the company's accounting date and 5 April 1989 will not be assessed for 1988–89 under the accounts basis. To the extent that it was paid before 6 April 1989, it will not be assessed on the receipts basis either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided against a transitional provision to bring income for this period into charge in accounts basis cases. When the accounts basis started, income for a period similar to that which now falls out of assessment on the changeover to the new basis was assessed twice. Any provision charging tax on all the income which would otherwise fall out of assessment would thus clearly be excessive. Moreover, it would not be easy to derive simple and equitable rules which balanced the doubly taxed income against income which falls out of assessment under the present much lower tax rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
We must have an effective definition of when earnings are received if we are to have a system of taxation based on receipts. The clause provides that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In formulating a definition of receipt we began with the PAYE system: one of the objectives of the change is to bring the basis of assessment and collection into line. PAYE applies to payments; receipt is defined in terms of payment. That means that the same definition will pinpoint the time at which PAYE needs to be operated on earnings, and the date at which those earnings are received and are thus assessable under the receipts basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earnings will be treated as received when the first of a number of events occur. In relation to employees generally, it is when a payment of or on account of the earnings is actually made or, if earlier, when the employee becomes entitled to such a payment. For directors, however, for reasons referred to by the hon. Gentleman on the previous clause, we need a different system. The Keith committee recognised the problems in applying PAYE to directors' remuneration. It recommended that, in the case of directors, certain defined circumstances should be treated as payment for the purposes of schedule E and PAYE. We introduced legislation in 1987 which would have enabled that to be done, for PAYE, by regulation, but while the receipts basis proposals were under consideration, we deferred introducing those regulations. As "payment" for PAYE and "receipt" for assessment purposes are so clearly interlinked, it seemed appropriate to deal with both in the Bill. Clause 42 accordingly deals with the question of when payment occurs for PAYE purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the lessons learnt in relation to PAYE, the clause contains further rules to decide when the earnings of directors are received. They follow broadly the circumstances that the Keith committee recommended should be treated as payment. Events that constitute receipt of earnings by a director include the crediting of sums on account of earnings to the director in the company's accounts or records and what the committee referred to as a long stop—the determination of earnings, for example, when fees are voted at an annual general meeting. Earnings will be treated as received by a director when the earliest of any of these events, including those which apply equally to non-directors, occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, a clear and comprehensive definition of when earnings are to be regarded as received is a feature of the new basis of assessment, and the definition must deal with not only straightforward cases but the special circumstances in which directors are paid. In doing so we must heed the lessons from the Keith Committee. Clause 35 provides such a definition and, to ensure that the basis of collection and assessment is in line, a matching definition of payment for PAYE is proposed in clause 42.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new simpler basis of assessment applies for 1989–90 and charges to tax all earnings received, as defined, after 5 April 1989. If any of those earnings relate to an earlier period and are chargeable for that earlier period also under the present rules, relief may be claimed under the provisions of clause 36 to avoid
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
a double charge to tax. However, as I explained earlier the two clauses following on clause 36 have the converse effect of preventing through the transition some earnings escaping tax altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are largely technical. Amendment No. 135 clarifies the earnings to which the new receipts basis introduced by the clause will apply. The new basis of assessment applies to all taxable earnings. The amendment makes it clear that even earnings for the year before 1989–90 chargeable under the old Cases of schedule E which are being replaced by clause 34, will be assessable for the year if they are paid after 5 April 1989. Amendment No. 136 is a technical amendment consequential on that. Amendments Nos. 137 to 140 rectify a drafting fault and ensure that the clause is as I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his explanation of the proposals contained in clause 35 and in particular for his exposition of amendment No. 135 which is a technical amendment. I had thought it possible that that amendment would go some way to deal with the fears that I expressed on clause 34 about the transitional arrangements because the period that it covers is the same. The Financial Secretary said that it does not. It sets certain parameters but does not deal with the transitional problem that I raised earlier. It is important to bear that in mind when considering amendments Nos. 183 and 184.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear what we are arguing about and, more importantly, what we are not arguing about. The broad thrust of the proposals will simplify the tax affairs of the half a million directors or people who hold similar office. To that extent they are to be welcomed. I also accept what the Financial Secretary said about the need for clear definition. I would go further than that. The definitions set out for directors in this and subsequent clauses meet the point that the Keith committee made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I now address myself to amendment No. 183. Although we accept that the definition is effective in the clause for directors, we feel that not only directors should be brought within its ambit. It is possible for directors, who have a unique status as employees, to alter the financial affairs of a company for which they are responsible to their own advantage. The clause sets the parameters by which they can do that, but it does not set the parameters by which they can make arrangements for those who are close to them, but who are not directors. The obvious example is close blood relatives. It is not unusual, particularly in a small business, to find the director's wife working for the concern too and to find his son and daughter drawn into the business later on. Their relationship with the director will be closer than that of other employees. It is also not unusual in the world of business for people to have associates who are so close that their affairs differ from those of a director and an employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks to give the Inland Revenue a measure that it would not use in the common run
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
of events but would use as a backstop. In the peculiar circumstances where the affairs of a company have clearly been arranged so that people close to the director are given a peculiar financial advantage against the interest of revenue collection, the Inland Revenue could demand that their affairs be organised in a way that is fairer to the Exchequer and less generous to themselves. The amendment deals with what I assume will be the minority, although not an insignificant minority of circumstances. It is intended as an anti-avoidance provision. If it is not enough, amendment No. 184 is intended as a catch-all anti-avoidance provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that no matter how thoroughly rules are devised and no matter how well intentioned those who draw them up are, it will always be possible for the tax avoidance industry to find a way through. The purpose of the amendment is to give the Inland Revenue a fall-back position so that it can demand a different set of arrangements from directors who have devised the structure of their company purely to maximise their own tax avoidance potential. It might be said that the measure is too wide or that it is improperly drafted. Often, Ministers, with the advantage of professional advisers, say that an amendment should have been drafted differently. This is a much-trawled area. If the Government's sole objection to the amendment concerned its drafting, rather than the principle that the Inland Revenue rather than the tax avoider has the ultimate advantage, we would accept returning to this issue on Report with a Government amendment designed to meet our concerns. The Government have the assistance of a parliamentary draftsman; we, regrettably, have not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sums involved are not small. I hope that amendment No. 184 could, in part, cover some of the issues that I raised on clause 34 about the transitional arrangements. The sums of money are quite large—£80 million and £60 million. The Financial Secretary confirmed that those figures are correct. He said that the net advantage to the Exchequer after the transitional period would be £50 million per year. Presumably, that will increase if inflation carries on at its existing rate. However, I must not introduce controversy into the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary is in effect stating that there is no way of dealing with the loss to the Exchequer in the transitional period—at least, when the Government considered the ways available, they rejected making arrangements to deal with it. I cannot see why they did so. It would not have been impossible to put in hand administrative arrangements to cover that period. I repeat that we do not want to tax people twice. But it is offensive to all citizens not covered by these provisions who have to pay as they earn because the tax is deducted from their wages before they can get their hands on it, that for a brief period, directors can, if they arrange their affairs correctly, pay no tax on part of their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been drawn to my attention that already those who give advice on these matters are saying that provided that people arrange their affairs
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
properly, they can take advantage of this loophole. People are being encouraged to draw their income into the black hole period—for want of a more technical term—and take advantage at the Inland Revenue's expense. That seems wrong. The fact that it strikes every Opposition Member as wrong is reflected in this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government share our desire to clamp down on avoidance, and it is possible to draft a better amendment, I am willing to take professional advice on how best the proposal should be structured. However, I do not accept that it cannot or should not be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On previous occasions you have remonstrated with me for taking too long, Mr. Cormack, so I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish first to declare an interest, which is already on the register: I am a director of a company. In that respect, this is a desirable move to simplify the system and make it more beneficial. However, I commend the amendment to the Committee. I am sure that the Government's intention is not to create avoidance. That is not the purpose of the provisions. The Committee would not wish to encourage people to seek tax advantages from such a streamlining and simplification of the system. The way to discourage that is to support amendments Nos. 184 and 183.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the spirit of the amendments, even if it is necessary to use more technical wording to achieve our objective. We must take a belt and braces approach to the problem, so that we can show that we intend to simplify the procedure, not to assist people by giving them tax advantages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal quickly with the amendments. Amendment No. 183 takes the definition of "director" wider than in the Bill. The definition in the Bill is not restricted to those on the board but extends to those who control the company. That has been commented on but not wholly welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have welcomed that; it was discourteous of me not to do so. The amendment is designed to deal with a key employee who is a relative or close friend of a director, but who is not currently caught by the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question was considered by the Keith committee in relation to the operation of PAYE. The committee came to the conclusion that its recommendations for directors should not necessarily apply to members of directors' families who also happen to be employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many instances where employees may be related to company directors, for example, in family companies, or people working on a part-time basis, and it would be wrong to have a catch-all provision. That is not just my opinion; it was the opinion of the Keith committee when it studied the matter. To extend the provision to include wives, children, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and grandchildren is unnecessary in terms of any mischief
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
likely to occur. However, we shall keep the position under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept amendment No. 184. I do not object to the drafting on technical grounds, but the amendment contains an arbitrary catch-all avoidance rules that would apply to the emoluments not only of directors but of all employees. It refers to arrangements that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"considered to be for the sole or main purpose of achieving a tax advantage".</p></blockquote>
It would be difficult to measure those and the proposed solution is that just and equitable adjustments will be made. But who can easily decide what is just and equitable? The amendment would go extremely wide, given that it would have a bearing not only on directors but on many other employees. The hon. Gentleman will forgive me for saying that it is very vaguely drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the Financial Secretary's comments on amendment No. 183 and his promise to keep the matter under review, and in view of the Keith committee's comments on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
