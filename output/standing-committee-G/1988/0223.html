	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That, during the proceedings on the Local Government and Housing Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee other than to say that I am sure that all committee members are most pleased to find that you, Mr. Hunt, are to preside over our proceedings, [hon. Members: "Hear, hear".] Your experience of looking after complicated Finance Bills may come in useful in several parts of this Bill. We can think of no one better to take the Chair. I am sure that your reputation for fairness and firmness will be amply shown during our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to join the Minister in welcoming you, Mr. Hunt, as Chairman. We are glad to have you here. We intend to debate the Bill well and hard. It is a wide-ranging Bill with a lot of meat in it, which I know you, Mr. Hunt, will appreciate in view of your knowledge of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Will you, Mr. Hunt, tell us a little more about how we can table new clauses? In the past, it has been usual to put down new clauses that are debated at the end of the Bill. I have no objection to their being taken—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member at this point, but we are discussing the sittings motion. If the hon. Gentleman wants to raise anything about new clauses he should do so on a separate point of order later in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, Mr. Hunt, and perhaps you will correct me if I am wrong—I am referring to the statement on the amendment paper, which links new clauses to individual parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are on the sittings motion, not on the order of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it should be called the standings motion, given the number of people who are standing. I repeat that this is most unsatisfactory. I know that it is not your fault, Mr. Hunt, but the size of a Committee is clearly known before it meets and, frankly, the position we are in is intolerable. We cannot do our work. I almost called the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), who is sitting to my left, my hon. Friend. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton has just made the good point that he cannot sit here and do his constituency work with me looking over his shoulder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Debating the sittings motion enables me, as the agency Opposition Whip on this very difficult and tendentious Bill, to say that the Opposition welcome the fact that the Committee will begin afternoon sittings on Tuesday, because we shall apply ourselves with vigour and application to try to improve the Bill, which needs a great deal of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, by Tuesday, Conservative Members, who I hope will be sitting opposite—I say that to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton—will from time to time join in our deliberations and not allow examination of the Bill to be left entirely in the hands of a responsible and vigilant Opposition while they attend to constituency case work, open their mail and read newspapers. I hope that they will participate in the work of the Committee so that we can do our best to send a dramatically improved Bill back to the Floor of the House on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. It was said earlier that more seating for all Members of the Committee would be desirable. It is implicit in what the hon. Gentleman said—we all agree with him—that a reasonable amount of table space is necessary if all hon. Members are to debate effectively this extremely complex Bill, which involves a great deal of paperwork.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West. The situation is unsatisfactory. In wonder whether we could adjourn for five or 10 minutes, perhaps to place a table across the bottom of the Committee Room. There is a member of the Social and Liberal Democrat party sitting on my Front Bench. This could cause problems. I expect my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) to arrive any moment with his dog. The situation is absurd. All we need os to adjourn for five or 10 minutes to bring in a table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. While we appreeciate the extra seating and tables that have been provided and the fact that there has been an adjournment to allow this to take place, I hope that it does not mean that this will be our usual meeting Room, because even with the extra furniture it is much too small. I Hope that representations will be made so that when we meet on Tuesday, we shall be in a more acceptable Room where there is more room to work and prepare our papers so that we may consider this very important Bill. Even with the additional tables and chairs, our present accommodation is unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a bit of a blow to the ego to realise that one's constituency is not on the lips of every hon. Member, printer and Clerk in the House. Although Banbury would benefit from Labour Representation—especially mine—my constuency is Newham, North-West. I shall be interested in Banbury only after my mandatory reselection process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) would associate himself with part of the comments of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks). My hon.

I cannot offer any immediate hope of remedy, but as soon as one of the other Committees moves out, we shall have a strong claim to a more satisfactory Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
On the point of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), the list of Members has now been corrected to amend the name of his constituency and to insert the name of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Franks).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to a point of order, Mr. Hunt. As there is a lot of pressure on Committee Rooms, this problem should be reported to the Floor of the House. Members should not have to tolerate such accommodation. They have done so for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the pressure is caused by insufficient room and a mountain of legislation being pushed through, the Committee has a resposibility to make clear to the House the conditions that we have to cope with. If legislation can be regulated so that the existing facilities are available, that should be done. If so much legislation is to be imposed upon us, facilities must be available for Committees to meet. If provision cannot be made, the matter should be reported to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly ensure that representations are made to the appropriate quarter. The hon. Gentleman has a remedy in that he can raise the matter if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government have sought to consider the Bill in this way because they think it would be for the convenience of the Committee, and I hope that the Committee agrees. We have no other reason. The alternative route is to discuss at the end a whole mass of points that have already been debated. That method is inconvenient for members of a Committee and confusing for Ministers and Opposition spokesmen, who find themselves having to deal with issues that they thought they had already covered. The intention is to deal with each of the items together so that we may know that we have left them and can move on to the next subject. I hope that hon. Members will agree that it is for the Committee's convenience, and we shall be happy to listen to any other suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the grouping of the new clauses. There is great merit in what the Minister said about being able to debate new clauses at the same time as the relevant amendments, but a problem arises when it emerges during debate in Committee that it is appropriate to table a new clause. If we follow the proposal rigidly, the Opposition will not be able to do that. Opposition parties are always at a disadvantage in this respect because, unlike the Government, we do not have the back-up of the Civil Service, legal advice, and so on. We table amendments and new clauses as we think appropriate, but if we debated an issue on which we wanted to table a new clause, I hope that the Committee will agree that we could still table the new clause and debate it at the end. I do not imagine that we would wish to table them en masse, and were we to follow such an unwise path, I am sure that the Government would find a way to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I accept the logic of the Minister's suggestion, I do not want to rule out the possibility of Opposition Members tabling a new clause where it becomes relevant and necessary, following a debate on a certain day on a certain topic, because it might not have been apparent to them at the time when the debate took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond in the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman made his suggestion. Normally that does not happen because new clauses are dealt with at the end of each part, and therefore the need for them will become obvious during the debates on each part. If an obvious and reasonable case arose, I would give an undertaking to facilitate a variation of the order of consideration. The hon. Gentleman says that he would not use it for a dilatory purpose, and we would therefore be as helpful as we could.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask you, Mr. Hunt, to clarify that there would be no problems in doing that, in terms of the order of proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would be necessary to move an amendment to the order of consideration, as agreed by the Committee, but subject to that, it would be perfectly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I am content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DISQUALIFICATION AND POLITICAL RESTRICTION OF CERTAIN OFFICERS AND STAFF</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 2, line 9, leave out 'or remaining'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will have noted, Mr. Hunt, that we tabled two or three other amendments that have not been selected, and I understand why. Although we do not like the implications of the Bill and, of course, of this clause, which we shall oppose, we felt that there was a case for offering an alternative for the Government to consider, even if they did not agree with us that the Bill and clause are unnecessary. I hope, therefore, that we may at least touch on those issues in our debate on amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 states the Government's intentions. Its heading is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Disqualification and political restriction of certain officers and staff."</p></blockquote>
That says it all. The Bill is an undemocratic attack on local democracy, and continues a long line of Government attacks. The amendment would mitigate its effects and make it more consistent. It picks out an inconsistency in the drafting of the Clause. Clause 1(8) provides that an individual holding a politically restricted post who is a member of a local authority within the period of two months after the Bill is passed, may continue to wear both hats until the end of his or her term of office. But clause 1(1) imposes a blanket ban on anyone becoming or remaining a member of a local authority if he holds a politically restricted post. The amendment would remove the words "or remaining", the retrospective element of the legislation, so that someone who is a local authority employee and a local authority councillor may decide to remain in a restricted post or to continue to serve as a councillor until it was logical to choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall show how the absurdity has arisen by referring to Mr. Widdicombe's detailed report. Volume 1 of the research for that report is central to the thinking behind the clause. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a sizeable body of opinion—probably about half the members and officers—to the effect that officers in the most senior posts ought not to be serving as councillors elsewhere."</p></blockquote>
It emphasises that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Few in fact do. The practice is largely one which involves junior rather than more senior officers. Insofar as this arouses concern, it is more through a vague sense that it may be inappropriate or unwise rather than through any specific evidence of a conflict of interests. The possibility of such a conflict of interests is identified by those opposed to the practice, but clear examples of its operation are rarely, if ever, quoted."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would allow a person to choose at a logical time whether to give up his job or to give up being a councillor. That is not just tidying up. The Government have failed to produce evidence that there is a problem. Widdicombe said that there is not a significant problem. The Government say that there is and that people are abusing their positions. They have asked for evidence and produced a few isolated cases. We have numerous examples of Government abuse.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley), who was a councillor and a psychiatric social worker, would have had to give up one of her jobs if the legislation had been in force. She would not have been able to stand for election to the House while she was a psychiatric social worker because her rate of pay would have meant that she was in a politically restricted post and therefore could not be a councillor or canvass for the Tory Party, which she must have done to win her seat. She would have had to give up being a councillor at the end of the period for which she was elected, but she would not have had the option to continue being an officer unless the amendment had been accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in the case quoted, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State could have applied for permission from the adjudicator if she considered that her job was not politically sensitive and was therefore suitable to be held in tandem with being a councillor? That reasonable provision is not available to civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be ludicrous. No doubt hundreds of people would immediately make applications to the adjudicator who would have to adjudicate, in effect, on unknown guidelines about what is or is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How on earth could it be argued that a psychiatric social worker does not have detailed dealings with the public in which her advice might be regarded as relevant to council policy? Suppose that in her job as a psychiatric social worker the hon. Lady says that she will take a child into care or initiate proceedings so to do. A council is bound by law about when it can take a child into care. But it also has policies surrounding such action and the hon. Lady would have had to make decisions in that respect. Most of us know from our advice surgeries that people go to see Members of Parliament and councillors when children are taken into care. They complain about how it has been done and the arguments that underpin it—in other words, they complain about the policies. Unless our amendment is accepted, the hon. Lady would either have had to give up her job immediately or stop being a councillor, which would have meant resigning and causing a by-election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absurdity of the Bill is already apparent and just one small amendment demonstrates that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that cases such as those cited by my hon. Friend should be referred to the adjudicator. If that is to be the standard and the norm, is that how local government officers will view the Bill? I should have expected that those cases involving doubt would go to the adjudicator. As my hon. Friend said, certain issues are clear cut according to the Bill, including people who would be ineligible for office. If the Minister says that that is not so, are we to assume that people in certain capacities could serve as members of the local authority and, at that level, there would be reference to the adjudicator? In view of what the Minister said, tremendous problems will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but I wish to focus on the specific problem of what would have happened in a certain case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to focus on a specific problem, perhaps we can get it right. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, South-West (Mrs. Bottomley) was not a member of a council while serving as a psychiatric social worker. Moreover, she would not have been so as she would have considered that unsuitable for very much the reasons outlined. The hon. Gentleman must not use a case in point which is not one. It is reasonable to cite a case, but to suggest that my hon. Friend was in that position when she specifically chose not to be is a bit off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to accept that at the time the hon. Lady was not a councillor. But can we be assured that she did not stand for election when she was a psychiatric social worker?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am really not going—[Hon. Members: "Ah!"] With respect, that is not the point. We are discussing councillors and working for, and being elected to, a council. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss another matter, he can table an amendment relating to Members of Parliament. But the hon. Gentleman must not claim that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State was a councillor when working for a council when she manifestly was not. It is improper for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily withdraw that suggestion. But if the Minister is already in such trouble at our first sitting, he will no doubt be in serious trouble before the end of the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill prevents local authority workers, above a certain salary level and subject to certain constraints, from taking part in political activity. That means being a councillor, standing for election and even canvassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to believe that the Under-Secretary of State did not go out canvassing? Is that how one gets a seat in the Tory party? Perhaps Conservative Members are not allowed to canvass. Perhaps they have to win their seats in some other magical way—by selling cakes at the local village fete, for instance. The Minister cannot get away from the fact that the Under-Secretary of State was active in politics in a way that would not be allowed under the Bill, and I would guarantee that many more would be caught by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The simple one-word argument, which neither the hon. Gentleman nor his party has ever understood, lies in the word "democracy", and I shall come back to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In about May or June last year there arose a particularly good example of difficulties in social work practice in a local authority. It was what has become known as the Cleveland affair. As a psychiatric social worker, the Under-Secretary of State would have been directly and deeply involved in cases of that nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to personalise his argument too much. Passing reference to a Committee Member is in order, but I hope that the debate will not centre exclusively on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not centre exclusively on that. The hon. Lady is very distinguished and we all have a lot of time for her, but she is a member of the House of Commons and has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
become so in a way which would not be allowed under the Bill. My argument is that it is in the Committee's and the House's interest to use actual examples, and this example does not in any way denigrate the hon. Lady. Indeed, I understand that she was a very good psychiatric social worker; I do not question that. I have no doubt that she is a very good Member of Parliament; there is no reason to question that either. What I do question is the position that was brought about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is to continue with his argument, he must accept that the Bill does not stop someone in those circumstances standing for Parliament. The Bill deals with councillors and people employed by councils. If a council employee feels that the job which he is doing is not sensitive, he can appeal to the adjudicator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us can speak ad hominem. I remind the hon. Gentleman of what he said on Second reading about criticising an hon. Member for mentioning anybody by name. It would be more proper for the hon. Gentleman to use examples that do not concern a Committee Member who neither was a councillor, nor stood as a councillor or had any intention of standing as a councillor. Twin-tracking did not arise, the hon. Gentleman ought to confine himself to an example which does not concern a Committee member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being ridiculously sensitive. I stress that I did not, shall not and do not intend to criticise the hon. Lady in any way. She is an excellent person and a very good Member of Parliament, and I am sure that she is a first-class psychiatric social worker. I hope that I have cleared the Minister's mind of anxiety on that score. This is in no way a personal attack. She is a very nice person who is a member of this House, so I can keep to the example, which is important for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would have happened in Cleveland? Let us suppose that the hon. Lady chooses to stand for Parliament, go out canvassing or something of that sort. The Cleveland affair bursts and the hon. Lady is one of the social workers involved with one of the children who is alleged to have been abused. The hon. Lady is faced with a problem. She must immediately resign if she is a councillor, or even if she is not a councillor. We are told that she was not and I accept that. Either way, she must give up her job immediately. She cannot go out canvassing or stand as a Member of Parliament unless she gives up her job immediately—not at an appropriate time named in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is illogical and irrational. It is also disastrous for local democracy. That type of restriction would be of no benefit to local democracy—we would not even have it for civil servants at a similar level. So abhorent is the idea of democracy to the Minister, his hon. Friends and Members of his party that they feel they must stop people from taking part, curiously enough at the very time when the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister are trying to encourage the idea of active citizenship. The moral of that story is, "Don't be too active, because if you are, you'll have to give up your job." Unless the amendment is accepted, that warning will stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You would rightly call me to order, Mr. Hunt, if I strayed too far into a wider debate on the clause. We shall return to that later, but I put it to the Minister and his hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Friends that they are creating an absurd situation which will be grossly unfair to people in local authority work who wish to take part in political activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister constantly saying, "It doesn't matter, because in that particular case it was not a councillor," because she could have been out canvassing or standing for election to Parliament or the council. The nonsense which the Government have already got themselves into in clause 1 means that that hon. Member would have had to give up all political ambition and trying to serve the community—I take it that we regard serving the community as an important aspect of politics—or give up her job. That would be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe that the provision reflects a fundamental misinterpretation of what the public thinks is necessary. We all know that when members of the public come to see us as councillors or Members of Parliament at our advice surgeries, some of us are seen as independent. We are expected to judge the case perfectly rationally even though we are indentified with a particular party, but there are others in whom they would have less confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is any satisfaction to the Minister, I would, if I lived in the Surrey, South-West area, go along and see the Under-Secretary of State knowing that she would take up my case for me. I might disagree with her politics deeply, but I would be sure that she would take up my case. Most of us accept that, when we go to see our elected representatives, irrespective of party-policy issues, they will represent our case as they think best. When they do not, it is a failure of the individual, not of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is good and we should leave it intact. If we are to put people in such an abominable position, the least we can do is give them time to decide whether to give up political activity or their job. At present, the Government are using a blunderbuss to make them give up their job almost immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment should be resisted on a number of grounds, some technical but many absolutely fundamental. I think that the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) was right to raise the matter as a fundamental issue, but he did so on rather a side-wind, I thought. He took an example which may have been convenient but which was not perhaps central to the type of circumstance under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one or two examples of what I think the public are very clear about. They are, I think, clear that it is difficult for a deeply worried and concerned ratepayer who wants factual information from the deputy chief executive if that deputy chief executive, over the border in the next-door borough, is taking a clear, public and unequivocal party political line. I have been absolutely unbiased about that. I condemn people who do that, whether they are Conservative, SLD, SDP or Labour.

When a specific case was put to me about a Conservative councillor in Derbyshire who was also a senior officer in Sheffield, I said that I did not believe that to be proper because it is difficult for constituents—in the sense of their living in one area—to be comfortable with that situation if they have a different political view from that councillor. I used it from the viewpoint of the person going to the officer,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
not merely to obtain advice. My first contention is that our concern is for people living in an area who go to an officer and expect to receive independent advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tottenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the example of a deputy chief executive who receives a considerably higher salary than the officers he proposes to ban. Officers who receive salaries of £13,500 or more hold positions that are considerably lower than that of chief executive. The Minister should concentrate on giving examples of officers at that level giving advice to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave an example of someone who earns more than £13,500 a year, the top of the scale, but I will move down for the hon. Gentleman's benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the scale, there is a junior education adviser in a borough, the person to whom a parent would go for advice on the next school for his child. Let us imagine—this is not far from an exact case, but I do not want to give examples ad hominem if I can avoid it—that the adviser is one of the Trotskyite councillors from a neighbouring borough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Come on!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I began with an example of a Conservative councillor. No one can say that I am biased in this respect. The hon. Gentleman does himself no good by suggesting otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I am using this example because it is one that I know about. I do not wish to give specific individual examples because I should not like to upset the parents in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us imagine that the parents go to this person, whom has shown himself in public terms elsewhere as having strong and extreme views which would have been equally as offensive if he had been a National Front councillor. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] In my opinion, there is no difference between black Fascists and red Fascists. They are all as bad as one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of black Fascists. Was he talking of a person's colour? Will he explain himself?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that black Fascists are Fascists of the Right and red Fascists are Fascists of the Left. It— [	<i>Interruption. </i>] The hon. Gentleman cannot dictate to me how to use the English language, which I have used all my life. [	<i>Interruption. </i>] </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were a parent going to either a black Fascist of the type of which I speak, or a red Fascist, I would not feel that I was getting independent advice. If I went to someone whom I knew to be a Trotskyite councillor, or a National Front councillor, I would not think that I was getting impartial advice, even though he earned only £13,750 a year. Some people in those circumstances are in a sensitive position when relating to ordinary people who rely upon them much more than most members of the Committee would. Most of us have the opportunity of going elsewhere for advice, but for many constituents the only person to go to automatically for advice is a person provided by the local authority.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Therefore his impartiality, whether on racial, sexist or political grounds, is important. We can maintain impartiality in many respects, and it is suggested that we maintain it on political grounds also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Grant)—I have no desire to upset him and I do not think that I have used unreasonable language—would want to protect people from having to go to an adviser who is manifestly racially biased, any more than he would want them to receive advice from someone who was manifestly sexist in approach. The hon. Gentleman has promoted and supported all sorts of legislation to that end. All we are saying is that it is equally unacceptable for a person to be manifestly and publicly politically biased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us examples. Can he not make the same, equally reasoned case about protecting the public and their natural concern about advice that they receive in, say, instances where senior housing officers from a council take part in a bid to take over the council's housing, and presumably help to prepare literature? Surely that would make it clear that they should opt out of the council while they are involved in drawing up literature and explaining to people their rights, or otherwise, in an unbiased way. Why should that example be any better or worse than other examples that the Minister has given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt have many opportunites to raise that issue. It will have to be discussed, but it does not happen to come within clause 1 or amendment No. 3. I do not wish the Chair to rule me out of order. If I were to answer the hon. Gentleman's point, I would not remain within the confines of the clause. The amendment relates specifically to the first part of clause 1. We have to accept that in the world outside the confines of this too confining Room, people want to feel that there is a clear distinction between those who are employed in an administrative position as officers of a council and those who seek political activity, because frequently the two positions are incompatible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Taylor. I am happy to hear a general argument on the amendment. However, the amendment proposes the deletion of the phrase "or remaining". It relates to a tightly defined element of the Bill, which is simply whether subsection (8) covers councillors who already sit. Subsection (1) seems to contradict it. If the Minister confines his comments to that, I shall accept them. I understand why you have allowed the debate to range widely, Mr Hunt. Therefore, I cannot understand why the Minister says that he cannot answer my question because you will rule him out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that the debate has ranged rather widely. I draw the attention of all members of the Committee to the precise terms of the amendment and urge them to remain within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I am grateful to you, and I fully support your comments. I am anxious to state why I think that it is in order to continue the discussion. The example given by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), which applies in some local authorities, would involve officers having to resign now. That would be the effect if the phrase that we seek to remove. The discussion is therefore relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish so early to have a direct confrontation with the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), but I do not think that he is correct. This part of the Bill, and references to it, do not deal with the issue that the hon, Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) raised. He may wish that they did. It would be quite reasonable if they did, but we are dealing with amendment No. 3. I had to put the broader comment to be able to come to the particular, which is that if the amendment were accepted, it would conflict with the recommendations of the Widdicombe committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee's report has been quoted, and its recommendation was clear. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors, or who are standing for election as councillors, or who have been a councillor within the last year, may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above."</p></blockquote>
The Government accepted that reasoning in their White Paper. The independent impartial Widdicombe committee made the proposal and now the hon. Member of Truro proposes that the Government should not go all the way. He argues that there should be a loophole in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major anxiety about twin-tracking is the suspicion of patronage. I say "suspicion of" because many officers are distinguished and reasonable people. I do not for a moment suggest otherwise. However, I shall give an example of twin-tracking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London borough of Hackney has recently appointed its new assistant chief executive, which is a senior post of some importance. The perfectly reasonable shortlist contained the names of two people who were senior members of the ruling group in the nearby borough of Lambeth. Both would be proud to say that they were relatively controversial figures in that they were clear party-political people—Miss Linda Bellos and the chairman of Lambeth housing committee. Both candidates have clear political views which are well known in London, and they are often quoted. They are people of obvious standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is whether people in Hackney who are not involved in the political process and who do not realise the high standards of those making the appointment can easily believe that in those circumstances the decision was entirely bereft of political involvement. I shall put the question as delicately as I can. Even if an appointment is entirely bereft of political involvement, is it easy for someone in the area who happens to hold a different political view from the successful candidate—for example, a member of the SDP—to feel that the decision is made entirely on grounds of competence, especially if it is difficult to accept that that is so from the cirriculum vitae?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my right hon. Friend is being slightly uncharitable to the Labour party in Hackney. Three Labour councillors in Hackney said that if Miss Bellos had got the job it would have been a political appointment. At least part of the Labour party recognises that her appointment would have been most improper, although they are being threatened with prosecution for defamation by Hackney council for their trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult case. Another problem is that at present Miss Bellos is the adviser on equal opportunities to Hackney.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
If I was employed in Hackney and felt that there was inequality, given some of Miss Bellos's statements that have been made elsewhere in other circumstances, I should find it difficult to believe that she could be a completely different person when dealing with issues that I raised with her. I am sure that she can be, however, otherwise she would not have done both jobs, but it is difficult for the ordinary Joe Soap to believe that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether we should put constituents—I use the word in its broadest sense to mean ordinary people—in the embarrassing position of wondering whether they are geting their fair do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a problem in the Minister's approach. Let us imagine a democratically elected councillor who is repeatedly re-elected because of his service as a councillor. It does not matter what views the councillor holds. They might be extreme Left or extreme Right, although there is a boundary on the extreme Right that I would not wish to cross. Will the Minister accept that in a neighbouring authority the same person can be considered a highly competent, professional officer? The two positions are not necessarily contraditory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As chairman of a Committee, I met officers whom I knew were politically active Conservatives elsewhere. In their posts in the authority where I was elected councillor they provided sound professional advice in their subject areas. Their political activities never created a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister quoted many lurid examples, but the truth is that many highly concerned people who are elected councillors are also diligent professional officers, as no doubt the Under-Secretary of State would have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly respect the experience of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth), but I hope that he will not take it amiss if I say that I fundamentally disagree with him. As a Minister I do not know my private officer's political opinions, and I do not wish to know. The interview of candidates for his private office is the only time when a Minister takes part in appointments in a Department. I would not consider appointing a candidate who suggested what his or her party politics were. The advice that I receive should be entirely impartial. I should find it more difficult to accept that advice was impartial if I thought that the person concerned was a Conservative or a Socialist. It is not possible to have such a relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is a distinguished and moderate man. I do not think it is right to say that there is a line on the Right which democratically one cannot accept but not one on the Left. If a line is drawn, it must be not about Left or Right but about the attitude of individuals to one another. Therefore, neither racism or classism are acceptable. Both approaches treat people as members of a group and not as human beings. I accept neither of those and, in a democratic society, there must be some rules about what can be accepted in those directions. That is why we have legislation such as the Race Relations Act 1976. It does not matter whether a person is on the Right or Left if he transgresses that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) must accept that it is difficult for the public to make a distinction between somebody acting in the capacity of a paid administrator giving impartial advice and someone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
acting in that capacity who is a politician, albeit not a very controversial politician, in a neighbouring authority. That is not only my opinion. The public agree, the Widdicombe committee thinks that and so does every independent observer. The only people who do not agree are those who have many people in their parties who are in that position. That is the only difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) referred to his local authority, but was it not the borough of Knowsley which employed Mr. Derek Hatton as one of its officials? By all accounts he was rarely in attendance to work for that authority, and the ratepayers were paying him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must defend the hon. Member for Knowsley, North from my hon. Friend for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). I know that the hon. Gentleman's personal involvement in that matter was honourable. He has always upheld the view that although he supports twin-tracking, he has supported it only on the basis that the job is done in one place even if a person is standing in the other. The hon. Gentleman has a mistaken view of twin-tracking, but it is a wholly honourable one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat what I said on Second Reading. The Knowsley council eventually disposed of Mr. Hatton's services because he was not doing his job in the borough. That proves the opposite point to the one that the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once it became apparent that Mr. Hatton was not doing his job, he was dismissed from his post. That decision was taken in difficult circumstances by senior councillors and chief officers.—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] It does the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) no credit to laugh. That was a serious decision taken by serious people in a serious way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman agrees that I have made my position clear. I believe that he continues to take an honourable position on the issue although it is one with which we disagree. However, would it not have been better if the position had not arisen in the first place? Is it not more sensible to say that in life one has to decide pretty early in local or national Government whether one is a figure of controversy who will take one side and present it with vigour and enthusiasm, or a person who administers, advises and plays a decent, proper and extremely important role?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not have had this discussion in the past because people knew—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Apart from the town clerk in Bangor who was also a Member of Parliament—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition Members will not mind me saying that I do not believe they have been listening to the average generality of the public. Hardly anybody outside the ranks of the party political groups of Opposition Members think that there is any argument about this. They think, as the Widdicombe committee proposes, that it is wholly improper for somebody to be a party politician in
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
one place and pretend to be, propose to be or present himself to be a non-party political figure in another. They think that that is impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge Opposition Members to bring me any significant body of independent opinion which does not automatically think that. That is why for hundreds of years nobody did it. The truth is that this is a new, modern change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making a strong case. He is saying that if a person is appointed with known political views by local or national Government, either the appointment is wrong or the public will distrust that person. Can the Minister tells us whether the Prime Minister was wrong to appoint Sir Bernard Ingham or whether we are to distrust him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, as we are not discussing ad hominem, the truth is that there are clear rules about party political activity by members of the Civil Service. We seek to lay less heavy burdens on local authority officials than those that civil servants already have. They will be less heavy because local authority employees will have a clear right in all circumstances, below the level of a very senior post, to appeal to an independent adjudicator for the right to stand. That is not true of civil servants. They have some rights of appeal but not such a general one as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely do not understand how the hon. Member for Hammersmith can promote the view that he has put before us. This is one part of the Bill where I find it impossible to understand how anybody can put up a case against it. If someone living in a borough wants to receive impartial advice and the person giving that advice is a party political figure elsewhere, he will not believe that the advice he reeceives is impartial. It does not matter what the hon. Member for Hammersmith thinks, or what I think. I do not believe that people who go to the town hall for impartial advice and find that the person sitting in front of them is manifestly a party political figure whose photograph they see in the local newspapers, and whose words they have read in the local press and heard on the radio, will believe that it is proper for that person to give them independent advice. I do not believe there is anyone in the country, apart from Opposition Members, who think otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. I have not been in the House that long to serve on many Committees but, frankly, I am confused by what is happening. May I have your guidance, Mr. Hunt, on what I can say later, because so far the Minister has not spoken to the specifics in the amendment. I would like to make a clause stand-part speech, and I thought I had to do that after the amendment was considered. If you, Mr. Hunt, are going to allow the Minister to continue in this way, may I have your guidance on how I should make my speech when the time comes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer hypothetical questions. I am listening carefully to the debate and if I consider that something is out of order I will so rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way because I want to get to the nub of the amendment. The problem arises when a councillor obtains a job in another council. However honourable the choice of that person may be and however excellent and qualified he is, there is no doubt that his

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would perpetuate the suspicion about patronage, which the Bill seeks to tackle. It would perpetuate the very syndrome of jobs for the boys and girls, which we believe must be ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can describe the Minister's style only as viciously pious. He said a little earlier that the problem has only recently arisen, but that is manifestly untrue. It is a simple as that. I suggest that those who are politically known will be treated more openly because people can discount some of what they say. It is those whose views are not so openly known who are a danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a bad case of an exchange between Newham and Hackney involving officers and members. It had been going on for years. The Minister probably knows nothing about it. The one common factor was that they were all in the same lodge. That was why the exchanges took place. The public, the electorate, did not know about it, but the Labour party in Newham did and stopped it, without legislation and lectures from the Minister. If the Minister thinks that such things did not happen before, he does not know what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must accept this from me. I do not believe that merely because circumstances are publicly known they can be excused. Simply because it is known that someone is extremely biased in one place and claims to be unbiased elsewhere does not make things easier when people go to him for advice. My concern is about the ordinary person who goes to the town hall for advice, the person who should feel comfortable in the democratic process—[	<i>Interuption.</i>] That individual must feel comfortable with the officer. He must know that the officer is independent and acting as an officer. That must be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

How can a senior officer give impartial advice to his council or advise on matters of propriety when he is politically active in another council? It is inevitable that he will be viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties and that, as a result, the performance of his duties will be impaired. Officers are officers of the whole council, not of a part of it. No doubt Opposition Members would find it difficult to deal with a councillor who is a Right-wing Tory education chairman on a neighbouring council and is demanding and keen for schools to opt out if they, in their council, took a wholly different view. Presumably hon. Gentlemen would find it difficult to accept that person's advice as impartial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Let us imagine that a Labour councillor in a minority group—found that a senior officer was the chairman of a neighbouring council's education committee and that he took a high profile line in suporting Conservative views on education. Could he regard that officers advice on education as impartial? would that be possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use such an example because of a recent case of twin-tracking when the acting director of a social services committee in one council was the acting director of social services in a neighbouring council. It was not surprising that Social and Liberal Democrat and Conservative councillors found it a little difficult always to believe that advice they received was unconnected with the political views being expressed by the same person in the neighbouring council. To argue against that is to argue against the obvious. It must be true. Surely it is only partial pleading that leads Opposition Members not to accept that wholeheartedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is essentially talking about propriety in local government and trust in the officers of local government. The Minister says that he is genuine and that he is interested to take account of both sides of the case, but we should be much more aware as how genuine he is if he said categorically that he feels equally strongly about housing officers who advise councillors on whether their housing should go into the private sector when they are directly involved in the bids for that housing. I accept that they are not councillors, but the issue is the propriety of the officers and how councillors seek advice from them. If the Minister said that those officers should also be included, in the provisions that we are considering, at least he would show signs of being genuine about the actions that he has described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am clear that councils should have independent advice in those circumstances. I am clear also that the matter does not come within the clause or the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He must not constantly castigate me for not discussing a matter on which he has not tabled an amendment, which does not come under the clause and is not connected with the amendment under discussion. Moreover, if I discussed it, I have no doubt that you would call me to order, Mr. Hunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must let me come back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Question is whether the Minister pursues a logical and full argument and not whether a certain amendment is before us. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to accept that his argument is logical, full and consistent, he must be prepared to say whether the provison would apply in the example which I have presented to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that, in the case which he outlined so briefly, I believe that it would be necessary for the council to have independent advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer my right hon. Friend back to the issue about councillors serving on other authorities as officers, and ask him how he thinks the chief officers and officers of the authority feel when they know that one of their fellow officers is a politician in another authority and would be in cahoots with the politicians on the authority of which he is an officer? How could they discuss in confidence the decisions that chief officers must take about the advice that they give councillors, when they know that one of their chief officers or senior officers would pass on that information through the party political machinery?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not significant that the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth)—I made no aspersions on his honourable record in Knowsley, but I choose his authority because it has a particularly bad record—said that senior councillors in Knowsley found it difficult to sack Mr. Hatton? Is it surprising that it took them two years, when many of them were employees of Liverpool?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to dwell on that because there are always some who act with considerable honour and others who do not. It would be a pity to tar everybody with the same brush, and I am trying not to do that. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend must be right when he says that it is more difficult to deal with such matters when council officers are councillors on the neighbouring council. What is their position when an issue arises that involves the council to which they owe their bread and butter? My hon. Friend's assertion must be true. Even if it is not, it must appear to be true to the people who live in the area. That, after all, is part of the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been pressed about twin tracking, and I think that the word "sledgehammer" has been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) underlined the other problem which I had not mentioned and which is made worse by the amendment. I am concerned about the ordinary people who leave the council and its services and not so much about the other officers. I am concerned, too, about the considerable
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
difficulty that faces normal career officers when there are appointments that are either party political or involve party-political figures, as a result of which officers have an ambivalent relationship with other officers. It is a difficult and delicate situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example that is not meant to be contentious but it is the clearest one that I can give. The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives changed its rules to exclude appointees without any appropriate local government experience. It did that partly because Mr. Reg Race was appointed as the chief executive of Derbyshire. Apart from a short period as an adviser to NALGO, it is hard to see that he had any appropriate local authority experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result, the SOLACE decided that it was not proper for people with such a lack of qualifications to be members of the society. The members of that independent body cover a wide range of politics, although they do not show their politics, and they decided that it was just too embarrassing to work in that way. They wanted to make a clear distinction between those who were party politically involved and those who were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first entered local government in the 1950s, I served on the Knottingley urban district council, on which there was a group of people who were termed independents and who said that they were non-political. That was true of some, but not of others. The Bill talks about a
	<br><blockquote><p>"Person holding a politically restricted post".</p></blockquote>
If a councillor is elected on an independent ticket, publishes a non-political election address, and then applies for a post in the neighbouring authority, would he be restricted under the Bill? How can a person who professes to be and campaigns as an independent be branded as a political animal? How can one reconcile that? If, as the Minister says, the word political is significant, how does it apply in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He or she would be covered. I shall give an example. I agree with the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that "independent" often does not mean what it says. There are independents in many different parties. I think of one independent in my local council who clearly supports a particular party, and I remember one appalling case when there was an independent candidate who was opposed by Liberal and Labour and who was the secretary of the local Conservative association. I found her independence somewhat difficult to understand. So I take the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction is between the nature of being an elected person and that of being an employed administrator. If an independent stood as independent and was opposed by two of the major parties but not by a third party, and there was clearly an electoral pact, it would be a very odd loophole arrangement whereby that person, having been opposed by Conservatives and Liberals, got a job with another council. The person's independence would be somewhat questionable, at the least. We therefore decided that the real distinction should be between elected and non-elected. That, I believe, has been widely thought to be the right distinction in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernie Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. On the basis of your previous ruling, are you saying that when we speak to the amendment we cannot comment on what the Minister said? That would be very unfair. When you were challenged earlier on points of order, Mr. Hunt, you said that the Minister was in order. Are you saying that we cannot respond to the various arguments that he advanced in his speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as generous as I can, but the debate has been ranging too widely. I am conscious that there is only one amendment before the Committee, and that has contributed to my somewhat relaxed attitude, but I am becoming concerned. There is always the danger that if hon.

I hope that the debate will now proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I respond to the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes). My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) is out of the Room on business, but my hon. Friends are covering adequately for him. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps one of the reasons for their absence is the length of the Minister's speech. The calls of nature alone are probably drawing people from this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was wrong when he said that Reg Race was not qualified in the sense that he did not have previous local government experience. I hope that the Minister will not keep referring to individual cases, but while he does I am duty bound to correct him. Reg Race was the head of a programme unit at the Greater London council and he was very efficient. The Minister must accept what I say because I did not accept inefficiency during my 17 or 18 years in local government. The Minister should get his facts right when he is speaking about individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Society of Local Authority Chief Executives decided that Mr. Race was not eligible for membership. I make no comment about him. I merely say that the professional body did not accept him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a member of the committee that appointed Mr. Reg Race as the programme officer of the GLC. It will not surprise the Committee to know that I voted against his appointment. I asked Mr. Race if he would give up active politics if he were appointed. He said, "Yes I will, I certainly will. I do not intend to seek office of any sort or to run for Parliament again." Perhaps he was not admitted to the professional body because the members did not believe that he knew what he was talking about even in his personal life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Others must make that judgment. I have made no allegations against Mr. Reg Race. I merely said that he was appointed by Derbyshire Council on grounds that many would find difficult to assess and he was not admitted to the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a councillor is offered a politically restricted post on another authority, he has a choice. He can decide whether to work as an officer in local government or to continue his political career in local government. He should not be able to do both, as the amendment proposes, because the conflicts are too great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no contradiction in subsections (1) and (8) because subsection (1) covers the general rule. Subsection (8) is a transitional provision which relates to officers who are currently councillors and ensures that they can serve their current terms. There is no contradiction; the principle remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two sides of the Committee differ on a principle. The Government believe that, irrespective of the politics of the person involved, it is inappropriate for most local government employees to act as elected members on other authorities, the Opposition do not believe that that is inappropriate. It is difficult to comprehend the Opposition's argument but no doubt they will put their case when speaking to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that Part I applies to Scotland too. There are only two Scottish members of the Committee, my name does not appear on the list of members unless I have been mistaken for Bernie Grant, which is the only other Scottish name apart from Campbell.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that there are so few Scottish Members on the Committee. Part I will apply to 65 local authorities, more than a thousand local councillors, and many thousands of local government officers and voters in Scotland. If the Scottish people had their way, there would be no possibility of this Committee considering local government. Local government should be devolved to an independent Scottish Assembly—three out of four voters at the last election voted for that. It is sad that we are debating Scottish matters when most of the Committee has little knowledge of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the example of a deeply concerned ratepayer who wants to discuss something with the local council and comes up against an officer who has taken a prominently party-political line in public. I wish that there still were ratepayers in Scotland—as from next month there will be only poll tax payers, which Scotland does not want.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The Minister's argument was bogus. The town clerk of Dundee district council for many years was thought to be an independent officer giving independent advice to the council, but on his retirement he stood for election to Tayside regional council as a Conservative. He was elected and played a prominent role as a leading member of the Conservative administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argued that the public's only concern is that they know the officer's political beliefs. My constituents asked that town clerk's advice for many years, believing him to be independent, but in private he had the political attitudes and opinions that he showed so publicly on retirement. How does the Minister justify that? Does he think that members of the public should be hoodwinked about an officer's political beliefs? It is easy to disguise political beliefs and to give the impression that advice is independent when it is nothing of the kind. An officer could be trying to restrict or prevent elected councillors carrying out their manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister saying that it is impossible to hold strong political views and give independent advice? Or is he saying that it is possible to hold such views and give independent advice but no one must be told about it? The Minister seems to be concerned only with appearance, not with reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ballot box is the answer to officers who are believed to have given advice of doubtful independence and sincerity. People can vote against councillors who they believe have appointed chief officers who give politically biased advice. That is how the matter should be resolved—not by the Government telling the local electorate who they can vote for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the clause would cover independent councillors. On Tayside regional council, there is an independent councillor who is a member of the Conservative party and who votes for Conservative candidates at the general election. He is a great admirer of the Prime Minister, but he consistently votes with the minority Labour administration on Tayside regional council because be believes that that is best for his local area. Would he be covered by the clause? What public political line is he taking? Sometimes he holds a Right-wing view and votes Conservative and at other times votes with the Labour administration because he has a Left-wing view. What is his offence in the Minister's view which means that he cannot take a job in another area as a senior government officer? The Minister's arguments do not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Bill's implications for Scotland, the notes on clauses refer to "British local government officers" as though they were a single species. They are not. The United Kingdom has two very different systems. Scottish local government has a different structure, financing arrangement and tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard repeated examples from the Minister, and from Opposition Members about what goes on in English councils, but no one has given an example from Scotland. The tradition in Scotland that local government officers are completely free to engage in political activity has never been abused. I shall give way to any member of the Committee who can give an example of any such abuse. The Bill's definition of "a politically restricted post" is ridiculous in the Scottish context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Dundee district council at present has a press officer who would be affected by clause 1. He lives across the water in the area of Fife regional council. He is an active member of the campaign for a Scottish essembly and an active member of the Labour party in the Fife area, where he may well canvass at elections. There is nothing wrong with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area is sometimes known as the Kingdom of Fife because it is insular and different from the rest of Scotland. It is self-contained. It has its own press, media and interest in its affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know nothing about the hon. and learned Gentleman because people in Dundee do not take much interest in what happens in Fife, and people in Fife do not take much interest in what happens in Dundee. The press officer could legitimately carry out his duties as an employee of Dundee district council without being prejudiced by his political activities in Fife across the water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a fair point. The Government's motivation in applying the clause to Scotland may be so that they do better in future by-elections. The Conservative candidate in Govan had deplorable results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A principal housing officer for Dundee district council lives some distance away in Blairgowrie, where he is an active member of a political party. If he stands for Tayside regional council or for Perth and Kinross district council he will not compromise his position as a housing officer in Dundee. If the Minister thinks that he will, will he explain why someone who lives in Blairgowrie cannot be politically active and elected to the council in that town because he works as a principal housing officer in Dundee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because a tenant on the housing list who wanted to talk about a housing matter might be less comfortable with a housing officer who voiced strong political views elsewhere. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is reasonable that, for example, in the past, the chief executive of Clydebank was also a party political member of Glasgow city council? It is impossible to be an independent chief executive in Clydebank and a party-political elected member of Glasgow city council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be arguing that someone cannot hold strong political views and give independent advice. The fact that people do not publicly display politically strong views does not mean that they do not hold them. The Minister is saying that as long as people keep their views quiet they can give biased information, but that if they come out in public and say what they stand for they commit a crime that has to be punished. The Minister will not comment on whether people are better informed if they know who they are dealing with.

The Minister said that it must be unfair for a councillor who is elected in one authority to be given a senior appointment in another authority that is controlled by his party. Will the Minister give an example from Scotland? If not, he must explain why the Bill must be applied there. I know of no local councillors in Scotland who were given senior appointments by administrations of the same party elsewhere. It just does not happen, so the provision should not apply to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The civil rights of council officers in Scotland will be seriously infringed by the majority who will pass the Bill in Committee and on Report. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 would remove the words "or remaining". I do not know exactly when the Bill will come into force, so we do not know when the two-month period thereafter will be. District council elections have just been held in Scotland. Councillors elected in 1988 will hold office until 1992, doing a useful job on behalf of their constituents. After 1992, the people who voted for them will be disfranched because the councillors will be unable to stand for office again if they wish to continue in their present employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must read the Bill. The councillors will serve out their time, which is perfectly reasonable. The Bill refers to the time thereafter. People will decide in advance that they will not continue in their jobs so that they can safely stand or they will decide when the time comes. There is plenty of time. The Bill will not disfranchise anyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will disfranchise them. There is a tradition in Scotland that people are re-elected if they do a good job. There will be councillors who were elected in 1988 who will do a marvellous job for their constituents. Their constituents will be happy with them, but they will not have the opportunity to vote for them again in 1992. The affected councillors will have to make the decision. Their constituents will have the chance to vote for them again only if those councillors resign from their posts and put their families at risk. Councillors are poorly remunerated in view of the work they do. They are paid much less than members of the Committee. We are all well paid for our work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is missing the point. He is disfranching electors not only in Scotland but throughout England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional council elections will be held in Scotland in 1990. When will the Act come into force? Candidates who work in local government and who have been selected to stand at those elections are already canvassing, speaking to electors and building support for themselves, their parties and for the policies they represent. How will they be affected? If the Bill comes into force four months before the regional council elections, will the parties affected have to select new candidates? What is the Ministers answer? Silence. Perhaps he has not thought about the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simple. At present, those candidates are not affected because we have not passed the Bill. If we do, they will have to decide whether they wish to be employees of local authorities or to be elected. If they
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
wish to do both, they will have to show that their local authority employment either pays less than £13,500 a year or involves no contradiction with elected office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time and again, it is clear from the Minister's answers that he is not prepared to let the people decide. Under the Bill, an individual has to decide whether to stand. The voters are cut out of the scene. They cannot decide whether they want a councillor to be elected or re-elected as their representative. Under the Bill, the Minister is deciding for them by excluding some councillors from running for office in the 1990 regional council elections. That is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where is the democratic legitimacy in people who are not only out with Scottish local goverment but out with Scotland deciding for Scottish electors who they can vote for? It is indescribably undemocratic that the Bill should apply to Scotland.

Amendment No. 2, which refers to local authority associations developing a code of practice for employment matters, was not selected. I hope that we can refer to it. If the amendment had been framed nearer to terms that were acceptable to you, Mr. Hunt, it would have allowed Scottish people an ideal way out of the dilemma in which they find themselves. I doubt whether most Tory Ministers know that the local authority association in Scotland is the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents all 65,000 local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, we cannot debate an amendment that was not selected. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your advice, Mr. Hunt. There is concern about this issue in Scotland. The matter is not in black and white. There is anxiety about people who are employed by one council and elected by another. The only worry that has surfaced in Scotland over the years is that people should do the job for which they are paid by the employing council and that they are not absent for long periods acting as councillors elsewhere. That can legitimately be dealt with by the Committee and the Government; what cannot be dealt with by the Committee is Scottish voters being disfranchised and denied the right to vote for people for whom they might otherwise vote. The clause will allow that to happen if the amendment is not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the views of my right hon.

The hon, Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr, Grist) who is the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, is present in Committee, as is the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). As recently as Monday, when we were discussing, on a point of order, who should speak on Welsh questions, I was told by Mr. Speaker that we are in a United Kingdom Parliament. We accept that, but the fact that there is considerable administrative devolution in Scotland and Wales means that we have separate Secretaries of State and, to a large extent, a separate system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked at length today about certain examples of people such as lie at the heart of the clause, but he did not mention people from Scotland or Wales. I hope that he will give us further examples to justify a measure that has no support whatever in the Principality or in

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the right hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Walker), who happens to be the Secretary of State for Wales, saying that he ought to exempt Wales because he and his hon. Friends could not give any example of abuse or corruption, or any act that was against the public interest. Like many of my hon. Friends, I have been in Taff-Ely recently and, in about 12 hours' time, the answer of at least one Welsh constituency will be given on this and other measures as they relate to Wales. I am convinced that this measure has no support among the Welsh political parties, or among the county or district associations, and it will not be mentioned by anyone in any by-election in the Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is well beyond the scope of the admendment. We are coming to clause 2. I hope that we shall restrict ourselves to the subject of locally elected councillors to which the admendment refers. It does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
refer to officials who take party political posts, to which the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) keeps referring. I hope that we can stick to the admendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Hunt. I will not comment on that intervention, but we must remember that it is the Minister who is making the comparisons and speaking about chief executives—of whom there are only a handful in the Principality. I repeat to him and to Ministers at the Welsh Office that, in Wales, there is no feeling at all for the Bill. During the coming weeks, I and other hon. Members will do our best from a Welsh viewpoint to ensure that the Welsh people know the truth, not the nonsense that will be fed to them as the clauses unfold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's position in all his comments has been to justify the principle that there should not be twin-tracking, although this is a more narrow debate because there are separate proposals relating to people who acquire jobs and seem to receive much remuneration when they are absent from their council. The Willicombe report recommeded that that should not be included. Although the Minister mentioned it several times, no doubt he agrees that the clause does not cover that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Widdicombe also rejected the suggestion that, where a person was both an elected councillor and an official, he might not properly serve the interests of the local authority to which he was elected. It is interesting that that was rejected in relation, for example, to association with private contractors or to people being members of two local authorities simultaneously, where it seemed equally appropriate. The Minister did not wish to go down that avenue. Widdicombe did, however, relate it to employees who, in his committee's opinion, should not serve in a political role on another authority. That was accepted, although when Redcliffe-Maud discussed it it was not thought that rules should be introduced. The Minister said that it is a recent problem, but Redcliffe-Maud examined it in 1974 and reached a different conclusion about what action, if any, should be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is that the proposal is very broad, covering 70,000 to 90,000 people. The Minister was somewhat disingenuous when he suggested on Second Reading that it was merely a reflection of the Widdicombe report. That is, first, because he has retained all the proposals in the White Paper, although he did not agree with the Widdicombe report, and, secondly, because he has presented the matter in terms of a financial sum rather than in terms of principal officers, which was the approach of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather more significant than simply a different way of doing the same thing, because there are implications for the people covered which the Minister does not seem to have addressed. That is important because the Minister will be allowed broad powers—he said himself that if the amendment were accepted it would remove a substantial part of those powers—to rule out people for work in the local authorities. He has justified that all along by reference to specific examples and the reasonableness of his proposed restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the Minister has given the Committee a misleading idea of how reasonable the Bill is. When the Widdicombe committee considered the proposals, it acknowledged that they were a deprivation of the rights of individual citizens. That is why it did not want extension
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
below a certain point. In effect, the committee said that it was a deprivation of rights and something which should be avoided in a democracy as far as possible. I hope that the Minister will accept that, and that in examining any deprivation of such rights in a democracy we must take any decision extremely seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Widdicombe committee wanted the proposals implemented through agreement on amending local authority terms and conditions of service because, it stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"political activity—is not a concept readily amenable to legislation and is not the subject of legislation in the civil service context. Flexibility moreover is required".</p></blockquote>
From all that the Minister has said today, one would have thought that it was easy to define what was wrong. He comes up with one example after another and challenges us to disagree with him, but I do not disagree with him on that score. The problem is that he has not given a definition anywhere in the Bill. He gives himself the power to extend infinitely widely beyond what exists, and it is easy to come up with example after example where surely that would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that must arise, if the Minister is to convince us that he is genuine in what he is attempting to do, is whether he has spoken to the local authorities and other bodies and to see whether he could reach the sort of agreement which the Widdicombe committee recommended? The Government have introduced the Bill, but it has left the Minister with the power to define political activity at his leisure. Should there not be rather more than a general assumption that he will get it right? Should we not see the detail on the basis of which we are meant to be agreeing of the relevant clauses, instead of taking the Minister's word that he knows better than the local authorities concerned, the electorates when electing their councillors, other Committee members or indeed, the House of Commons, which might wish to write the detail into legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That concern, which the Minister has entirely ignored all through his comments, is reflected throughout the comments that have come in on the Bill since it was published. Concern is felt by those who have indicated their general support for what the Minister is doing, as well as by those who have indicated their disagreement with at least a substantial element of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of District Councils said specifically that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"would wish to see the 'political activities' which are to be proscribed under Clause 1 defined on the face of the Bill. It is noted that the Bill is far more restrictive than was anticipated in the White Paper in terms of the political restricted posts … and we shall wish to explore the extent to which this extension is necessary".</p></blockquote>
That is from a body which starts its comments by welcoming the general thrust of what the Minister is doing, yet in addressing the amendment, the Minister's constant defence is that no reasonable person would accept that what he has done is right in all respects and that we should just nod it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of County Councils says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is clearly undesirable that the definition of political activity does not appear on the face of the Bill, but is left to be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The Minister must be aware that if we let this measure go through and accept what he says against the amendment and in defence of what he has written, we shall accept a measure that people on all sides think we should not accept. We need to see the details before the Bill goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper gave a different point of view and, on Second Reading, the Minister said that he had got it wrong. It is ironic that he should now tell Opposition Members that it is outrageous for us to object to his proposals and to say that the Bill extends to too many employees when that was his first reaction to the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering what was said in the White Paper. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government share, however, the almost universal doubts expressed about the Committee's proposal that the relevant group should be defined as 'principal officer' and above. This level is generally criticised as being too low for a blanket ban on political activity. It would affect some 70,000 staff many of whom, especially those in technical"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is now straying into clause 2. I must ask him to return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made that point because every example given by the Minister as a reason for rejecting the amendment and taking people out ot political activity or their current line of work, was an extreme example of where things can go wrong. The Minister has never referred to the fact that when he originally saw these proposals, he and the Government were prepared to say they went too far and that a blanket ban on so many people was not appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. There are two ways of doing this. One is to give detailed descriptions of people who are in and leave others out, the other is to have what we have proposed, which is not a blanket ban, in the sense that everyone below the level of principal officer has a right of appeal. My effort here was to provide a more flexible and sensible arrangement. Obviously it is more difficult to achieve that if we list all the crematorium supervisors and others and say that they are able to stand. I think the hon. Gentleman may agree that that is a sensitive way in which to achieve the aim. I hoped that it would be in line with the system proposed in the White Paper but rather more sensitive and better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I remember rightly, I did not say that we were wrong—I said that we listened to consultations. The result of those consultations was that we changed our view on the issue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that it is more sensible for everybody in this category to have the opportunity of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This goes wider than Widdicombe. Widdicombe said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where junior staff have considerable contact with the public … we do not see this as a major area of concern"</p></blockquote>
and yet there are restrictions on contact with the public that seem to conflict with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said repeatedly that the appeals process, through the adjudicator, is the solution to these criticisms. He turned down the amendment on that basis. I do not believe that the Minister has given answers to the Committee that will allow it to make a judgement on that defence. Perhaps the Minister is correct, but his remarks
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
raised many questions. The Minister's detailed defence raised criticisms and questions that are so legion that we cannot accept his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real answer for the Minister, as I tried to get through to him initially, is that the Bill does not necessarily require the appointment of anyone to whom people can appeal. It is a permissive, not a compulsory power. If the Government appoint someone, an appeal can be made only on the basis of the salary issue. No appeal can be made by people who are caught under clause 2(3). The Minister has not grasped those two points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Particularly the second point. That is why I said the provision went wider than Widdicombe by referring to contact with the public. As I understand the Bill, there is no appeal in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should say, in case there is any doubt, that the Government will, if the Bill is enacted, appoint such an adjudicating officer, but it would be silly to put that provision in the Bill. The Bill gives the Government the power to make such an appointment and I now undertake that we will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is only one reason for the difference. In posts where people earn below £13,500 a year, the local authority would decide—as a term of the contract, in one sense—whether a certain role would make party political activity unsuitable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman was not suggesting that it is improper for a local authority to say that, because of the sensitivity of a particular job, the post requires someone who does not participate in party politics. Surely that is a perfectly reasonable approach for a local authority. Only in those circumstances would such a person be caught. Indeed, I understand that the local authority would have that power in any event, without this change; but we thought it right to include that in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to that subject. We shall probably discuss it in greater detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise some specific questions and it would be helpful if the Minister could comment on some of the anxieties that arise from them. First, without knowing the guidance that will be given to the adjudicator about the basis on which appeals will be heard—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A passing reference to appeals is in order, but we cannot now have a detailed debate on appeals, which form part of clause 3. We must be patient and wait until we reach that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Hunt, but perhaps you will accept that we need at least some indication from the Minister now about why he thinks the appeals procedure and the adjudicator could perform the function that he outlined. That might show how he justifies his attitude to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central to the Minister's argument is the assertion that only some people would be caught by the restrictions and have to resign from the council or from their job. That is the choice offered by the very first clause of the Bill, if it remains as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to seek consensus on the issue. He hoped that both sides of the House would agree on it and expressed his surprise when they did not. That is in line with what Widdicombe said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this very wide-ranging prohibition"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
that is, on the Civil Service—
	<br><blockquote><p>"depends for its acceptability on the possibility of exemptions being granted on a case by case basis and on a reasonable consensus as to when such exemptions should be granted."</p></blockquote>
The Minister argues that all that we need to know is that there will be exemptions, an appeals process and that it will be possible for many of the 70,000 people to be exempted. He has given no indication, however, on which the Committee can form a consensus, of the basis on which that will happen. Suppose that only a handful of species from that 70,000 have a realistic chance of getting out. That is entirely different from only a handful of the 70,000 being in politically restricted posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 disqualifies someone:
	<br><blockquote><p>"from becoming … or remaining a member of a local authority"</p></blockquote>
if he holds one of those restricted posts. It is almost impossible for the Committee to decide whether we should see that provision through and accept what the Minister says, if we do not know how the decisions will be taken. The Minister is saying "We don't believe that it's possible to define this in the Bill. We must subsequently decide which person can or cannot perform these functions."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the honourable Gentleman to feel that he has to go on with this point. It is not a suitable issue to discuss now but my comments on clause 3, to which he is referring, will be of help to him. I wish to assist him in every way possible, and I think that we can get over the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's assurance is welcome. I hope that it shows that he will introduce amendments to provide more detail. I do not know whether that is his intention, but before we can judge the issue and vote in Divisions we need the details of his proposals, not just his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went into considerable detail, always expressing his right to do so on several specific cases. He even named individuals whom he believed were good examples showing why the Bill should be enacted in its present form. I accept that the Minister is trying not to name names but that he is pushed into doing so from time to time. He certainly gave detailed examples of how the Bill would work in terms of officers' roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the Minister's argument is that his criticism applies not to the role involved in a post but to the individuals in his examples — to the person who is well known for views in support of Conservative Right-wing education policy or for extreme Left-wing views against opting out. The Minister's proposals would not deal with many of his examples. People's knowledge of a person's views is not changed if that person, who yesterday advanced extreme views as an elected councillor for another authority, ceases to be a councillor and takes up one of the posts that the Minister describes as jobs for the boys. The Minister has not tackled the Derek Hattons of this world. There would be nothing to prevent Derek Hatton from walking into a job with any of these local authorities because he is not a serving councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chairmen of local Conservative, Liberal or Labour parties may, as a result of the Bill, feel unable to continue as chairmen, but their resignations will not alter people's knowledge of their political views. Even if we say that over time people will forget the political posts that those former chairmen held, the Minister has done nothing about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
another obvious, though rather less public, abuse — senior council officers who have political sympathies but do not publicly join a local party. They may not even do so in practice. They certainly do not hold elected positions, or expound their views on a platform, but they talk privately with politicians who advance public views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This cannot possibly be relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two aspects. We must decide whether the Minister's argument is reasonable, which was his only defence, and whether he is achieving his objectives — I do not believe that he is — otherwise there is no point in his pursuing his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister unveiled the Bill, an article in	<i>The Times</i> said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he wanted no council official … to be indentified with a political party."</p></blockquote>
That was his root-and-branch justification. But it will not be possible. I accept that there will be an obvious and immediate impact at the most senior levels—for example, chief executives should not be seen on the streets because they give direct advice to councils. But the bill has a broad brush. It is a pointless attack on the democratic rights of individuals because it will not do what the Minister wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argument is that the public want these changes. But the public want the best independent advice that is available. They do not want parties to use councils as jobs for the boys. They do not want the emotive cases to which the Minister referred to occur. They do not want ordinary men and women in low-grade jobs without a strong political role to be denied their democratic rights. They want the same restrictions on abuse that apply to those with connections in the private sector. The Minister is disarming in his attempts to present the measure as purely what the public wants, but the reality is that while the emotive cases are easy to come by they are not the majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of what the public will find unacceptable is the case of Alec Burdekin, the principal officer of an old people's home in Bude. That is his only role with the local authority. He has served for some time as an independent councillor on the same district council, North Cornwall, but in a different ward. His work does not affect his role as a councillor, but he directly advises the public at that old people's home. His advice to the council about the people in that home is likely to influence council policy. I suspect that his advice is taken on general policy towards old people's homes in the area. He is a long-serving, independent councillor who cannot see why what he is doing is wrong. His electorate will not think that it is wrong either, but he is not eligible to take his case to appeal because he is caught under a different part of the Bill. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am being disfranchised by being excluded from my democratic right to be active in local politics."</p></blockquote>
He is not well known, nor is he controversial, unlike those in the Minister's examples. He is more like the vast majority of the 70,000 councillors who will be affected by the Bill. The Committee should not accept the Minister's claim that he is doing what the public want. They will not take that view when they see the Bill in action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I served on the Education Reform Bill, as it then was, but that is my only Committee experience. Our debate has ranged very wide of the amendment. There have been many irrelevant comments, and the Minister has not responded to the amendment. So I shall attempt to speak to it, but I shall be brief, Mr. Hunt, because you ruled me out of order earlier when I made an intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a crazy situation because the Bill, as I see it, is unclear. Clause 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall be disqualified from becoming (whether by election or otherwise) or remaining a member of a local authority if he holds a politically restricted post",</p></blockquote>
yet it says later that
	<br><blockquote><p>"nothing in this section shall apply to him until the expiry of the period for which he was elected or for which he otherwise became a member of the authority".</p></blockquote>
It is not clear whether a person serving on a local authority will immediately have to give up being an elected member, or whether he will be allowed to remain until the office comes to an end at the next election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (1) does not say that; subsection (8) says that. The general principle that will obtain after forthcoming elections is evinced in subsection (1); subsection (8) deals with the transitional arrangements, because when the Bill is enacted there will be sitting councillors and someone must answer the question, "Does it immediately affect them?" The answer is that it does not. They do not have to make a decision until the end of their current term. That is a reasonable transitional provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That would be a travesty of justice, because he is an excellent councillor and an

excellent leader of the authority. I am pleased to learn, however, that he will be allowed to remain until the next elections.

What worries me also is that the adjudicating officer will be appointed by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
