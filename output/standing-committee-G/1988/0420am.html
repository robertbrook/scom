DUTY TO PUBLISH INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 624.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Anthony. If the amendment were moved, it would prevent the Secretary of State issuing directives to local authorities and the Government could not accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to move amendment No. 624, in page 77, line 19, leave out subsection (2).<br><br>
I thank the right hon. Gentleman for courteously allowing me a moment to settle in. As I am bereft of my hon. Friends, I am feeling slightly lonely. I am obliged to Conservative Members, who have better means of transport than Opposition Members when there is a tube strike.<br><br>
The amendments on renewal policy are designed to obtain from the Government information on their programme and plans for investment, so that local authorities know about them. They also seek to emphasise the enormity of the housing problem. Conservative Members may be surprised to know that I do not believe that the record of any Government for many generations, including Labour Administrations, on the restoration and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
renewal of housing stock has been something in which we should take pride. The past lack of investment is a problem which a Conservative or Labour Government would have to tackle.<br><br>
The clauses and the amendments reflect the difficulty encountered by local authorities and Government when coping with the present problems. The statistics on disrepair and the new categories of unfit and target properties reveal a problem of gigantic proportions. I say on behalf of local authorities that deal with the private sector and housing associations: Labour and Conservative local authorities want partnership with Government to try to tackle that problem.<br><br>
Surveys undertaken by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities show a £19 billion backlog of disrepair, and the need for investment. Indeed, the Government's own surveys acknowledge the need, over time, for about £18·8 billion investment by owner-occupiers, local authorities and the private rented and housing association sectors.<br><br>
In inner London there is a major and much greater problem in all sectors than elsewhere. In the London area as a whole, 48 per cent. of the total stock under the new definitions of unfit or of target areas require investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help me on an important question. As he knows, the amendment would stop the Secretary of State from issuing directions about how a renewal area might be dealt with in a local authority. There is no question of the Secretary of State doing that in a detailed way.<br><br>
I share the hon. Gentleman's feeling that, in the past, Governments have not been successful at tackling the problem. But does he agree that it would be helpful for the Secretary of State to have the power to pass on good practice from one local authority to another which may be encountering difficulties, thereby ensuring some consistency of approach? If the Secretary of State did not have that power, might that not lead to everyone trying to invent the wheel again, so to speak? Does the hon. Gentleman have a better approach? I do not think that this is a matter of great difference between our parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. The amendment should be seen in the context of local authorities' worries about deletions from the criteria in the 1985 Act. There is an understandable suspicion that when directions are given they will undermine accepted practice and, I believe, the universally understood criteria of existing policies. These criteria need updating and, because of the extension of areas to comprise up to 3,000 dwellings, will make a difference to the areas to be chosen. The criteria involve the need to view the total benefit—the environmental and social benefits—to an area and to take into account the lack of repair and the neglect by certain sectors. The Minister knows of the deletions made from the 1985 Act and the anxieties thus created.<br><br>
Ministerial direction might exclude people from eligibility for the new renewal programme because they do not fit into a category that is fashionable or acceptable to Government at the time, even though all local parties might agree that an area should be zoned as a renewal area and that the criteria laid down by the Secretary of State did not take into account the circumstances of the area. If the Government took into account the anxiety about the deletions from the 1985 Act and did not restrict the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 981</span>
resources needed to indentfy dwellings that need repair and renewal, I think that there would be more consensus. Perhaps the Minister will say this morning—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would help the hon. Gentleman to refer to the views of the Liberal Democratic party, whose representative, the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) has just come into the Committee, since he has so valiantly defended that party's honour for the past 12 minutes—a pleasure to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how to respond to that last comment, except to say that as the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), who is connected with this amendment, is now present, I should be happy to give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) has referred to the criteria that we shall use with regard not only to this clause but to this part of the Bill, perhaps I can assist him by saying what criteria we are looking for. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) was very anxious to have an answer to that question, too, so I think that it would be appropriate to give it now.<br><br>
A key feature of the renewal area provision is that local authorities will no longer need to seek the Secretary of State's approval of the declaration of individual areas. Instead, they will be required to observe the criteria specified in clause 17, and to undertake a full appraisal of the various options.<br><br>
We have already set up a number of pilot studies with local authorities to assess what form the guidance should take, and our initial view is that it should cover the following matters. The first is the selection of the boundaries of an area, bearing in mind, for example, community identity, natural boundaries and employment patterns.<br><br>
Secondly, surveys of housing conditions may be conducted; thirdly, surveys of local residents' wishes—which I consider very important, and I am not saying that we have understood them aright in the past—may be conducted to establish their feelings about the condition of their homes and the local environment and what they think should be done about them. The fourth matter is an appraisal of the costs of different options and different approaches to any particular option; and the fifth, an appraisal of non-economic factors, such as environmental and social considerations.<br><br>
The power to give guidance and for authorities to have regard to it replaces the more onerous current requirement for authorities to seek individual approval for housing action areas. We are aiming to ensure consistency of approach, which I believe to be an essential feature of our renewal area proposals.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the queries raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend explain how the new criteria which he has just outlined would differ from the existing criteria for both the housing action areas and general improvement areas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Of the five criteria that we shall use, the one that is in stark contrast to the criteria which were used in the housing action areas is the appraisal of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
non-economic factors and the taking into account of surveys of local residents' wishes about the condition of their homes. That was not done adequately or properly in the past. Also, we are now dealing with areas that are larger than the general improvement areas or housing action areas of the past. There is that major difference.<br><br>
We have made clear in both this and other parts of the Bill the way in which we want local residents to be kept in constant touch with what is proposed and the improvements that are to be carried out in their area. I personally welcome that. I cannot say that I put that in the Bill, because it was there before I took on my responsibility for housing matters in the House of Commons. I experienced difficulty with a previous enveloping scheme, when I felt that the residents in an area were not told what was going on or kept abreast of the improvements being made. I hope, therefore, that there will be dramatic improvements in that respect.<br><br>
In conclusion, I assure the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) that he need have no worry, although I understand the spirit in which he moved the amendment. As I told my hon. Frend the Member for Ealing, Acton, I feel that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should consider from time to time giving directions to a local authority for an area renewal project. Certainly it was necessary in Rossendale and Darwen in my constituency. That procedure would be used carefully, not indiscriminately. I strongly recommend the Committee to resist the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am on the right amendment—amendment No. 624.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am just glad to have my hon. Friend here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment refers to the overall issue of local renewal areas and how much information should be given or not given. Why does the Minister feel that he needs control at the centre, instead of allowing decisions to be taken locally? In the past, when housing action areas and general improvements areas have been set up, there has been a general declaration of intent. The local authority housing department has then set up offices in the area and has consulted local tenants—local residents, in the case of a general improvement area. Using the feedback from that consultation, detailed plans have been submitted to the local authority. At that point, proposals have been submitted for inclusion in the housing investment programme bid, and the Department of the Environment has been asked for permission to borrow the necessary funds.<br><br>
Why does the Minister want to have a say in that process? Is the local authority to have no discretion in what is to be contained, for example, in the initial leaflets to residents? Such leaflets normally state, "This is to happen in your area—a housing action area—and we intend to tackle the enveloping scheme or roadworks outside your property." Why does the Department of the Environment want to have a say in that initial leaflet? Unless subsection (2) is deleted, power will shift back to the centre. It will be a case of the Government expecting the Department of the Environment to interfere in the fine detail and minutiae of local planning. Surely that can continue to be done at local level, instead of in Marsham street. Why does the Minister insist on retaining the subsection instead of accepting our amendment to delete it?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0962">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 983</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) put his argument most fairly. I agree with 99 per cent. of what he said. I am anxious for decisions to be made locally wherever possible. It is right that that should be done. In fact, I should prefer them to be made at a level closer to the residents who stand to gain from the new housing renewal areas than the council.<br><br>
There are several reasons why we should preserve subsection (2). I agree that any power that is vested in the Secretary of State must not be used indiscriminately, but there are compelling reasons for some form of central co-ordination. It is important that new housing policies for larger areas are more carefully monitored and that we make comparisons between one area and another.<br><br>
There must be consistency when monitoring renewal areas for two reasons. First, it is important that the lessons learnt in one area and authority are applied in others. Secondly, if additional resources are to be made available to renewal areas, information on progress, and on the spending of those funds, must be publicly available. The clause would enable both objectives to be achieved.<br><br>
I shall explain the most compelling reason that I can offer the hon. Member for Leeds, West for having some central direction. I am talking only in terms of policy as I have already made it clear that the power in the clause need hardly be used. The hon. Gentleman probably misunderstood my explanation to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) about a scheme in my constituency that came unstuck, which could happen again.<br><br>
Estate action deals with the public rented sector. The Department works in close partnership with local authorities and we must monitor carefully what is going on. I see no difficulty in retaining subsection (2). I accept the main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I envisage that the provision will rarely, if ever, be required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a reason for monitoring. Often, budgets of housing action areas and of renewal areas cross boundaries, such as that between the housing budget and the urban programme budget.<br><br>
When the Minister said that he needed to make comparisons, I was tempted to intervene to ask him whether he wished to make comparisons between authorities or schemes. Will the Department say, "We would prefer the suggested scheme for a housing action area in Harehills to be sited in Armley."? Is that the sort of policy intervention for which the Minister wants the provision, or is he seeking an appraisal?<br><br>
A project sometimes takes two or three years to get going, after which a council may apply again to the Department for an extension. A project does not involve a one-off contract within a financial year. The timescale is often longer. Does the Minister want the provision for monitoring purposes or, if there are to be four housing action areas and three general improvement areas—which would be a lot in local authority terms—does he want to be able to decide in what cities the projects are sited? Does the Minister envisage the power being used in those circumstances?<br><br>
If there was intense lobbying and hon. Members who represented the areas involved made an appointment with the Under-Secretary of State, went to Marsham street and said, "We don't agree with where Leeds city council housing committee has decided to site the housing action area. It would be much better placed in our area." Would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
the Minister send his officials to Leeds to investigate so that he could make his own judgment and override the committee's decision on the location of the housing action area? Will the Minister clarify that for me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's last question is very pertinent. I can give him a straightforward answer. No. I do not consider that that would be the role of the Department of the Environment. Decisions are best made locally as often as possible. I have tried to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point. I can give the hon. Gentleman additional comfort by saying that the directions under the clause will have to be discussed with the local authority associations before they can be given. I am sure that will be welcomed by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
As for the hon. Gentleman's question about monitoring, I hope the Department is not so arrogant as to assume that we shall get everything right in the renewal areas. The hon. Gentleman asked whether comparisons would be made between authorities or areas, and so on. No two areas will be the same. In some cases, they will be wildly different and it will be difficult to make comparisons. We shall take all criteria into account and we hope to improve the programme as it develops and unfolds. Having given the hon. Gentleman the comfort he sought that directions should be discussed with local authority associations, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.<br><br>
Now that I have allowed the hon. Gentleman time for his colleagues to arrive, in case he wants to vote on the amendment, he has more support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's remarks, because he has gone some way to meeting our objections to the clause without the deletion if he is prepared to accept that local consultation should take priority, and so on. However, we are in a difficult position because we must rely on the Minister's word while he is Parliamentary Under-Secretary, but we shall have to deal with what is on the face of the Bill. Although an assurance has been given to the Committee, it is hardly likely that local authorities will be able to wave the <i>Hansard</i> of this Standing Committee around in their defence if the Department of the Environment were to use this power to move in on local authorities. We should delete this section of the clause, which is why I shall seek to divide the Committee on the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 12.</p>

Government amendment No. 259.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I am right in saying that amendment No. 713 is an SLD amendment and that amendment No. 547 was tabled by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). I am happy to speak to both amendments, but it might help the Government and the SLD if I gave them a little time to look at the amendments, which deal with public health matters and environmental health officers.<br><br>
Last Tuesday, the Minister assured me that he was giving me not a gift horse but a pony—but the pony was lame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister will be pleased to hear that amendment No. 547 is a probing amendment. It relates to the role of the private sector, or the developer, in improvement areas. Conservative Members have nothing against the private sector being involved in urban renewal and the improvement of housing stock.<br><br>
Amendment No. 547 seeks to delete the words
<br><blockquote><p>"including land which the authority propose to dispose of to another person".</p></blockquote>
What will the private sector's role be under the new regime? Are developers going to be actively encouraged and urged to come in and help to regenerate an area? Will housing associations be involved? What resources will enable that process to take place? Will there be a generous injection of public sector resources?<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Although we have nothing against private sector involvement, will my right hon. Friend the Minister sketch in a little more detail who the other people are to whom the local authority might dispose of land which has been compulsorily acquired, and how amenities will be improved? So far, most urban renewal has been done by owner-occupiers or landlords of rented property. It now seems likely that there may be a broader role for the developer. Although we have nothing in principle against that, it would be helpful for my right hon. Friend the Minister to say a word or two about the exact machinery of private sector involvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to speak to the amendment for any length of time. Amendment No. 713 seeks to add to the general purposes and powers of the housing authority
<br><blockquote><p>"the improvement of public health standards within the area".</p></blockquote>
The objectives referred to here do not include that; they include a number of other factors. Amendment No. 713 seeks to probe the Minister's intentions and how he understands the Bill.<br><br>
No Committee Member will believe that
<br><blockquote><p>"the improvement of public health standards within the area"</p></blockquote>
should not be an objective. I certainly hope that the Minister does not think it should not. However, if the Minister does not want the words incorporated in the Bill, can he tell us why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would say to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) that, although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
not as widely as he or I would wish, the private sector is involved in renewal in Birmingham and Blackburn, for example.<br><br>
To show what the Government have in mind, we might envisage the necessity of purchasing land for a private developer who is involved in a scheme to lay out a public park or similar amenity area, which would considerably benefit a town. If my hon. Friend's probing amendment were incorporated, clause 82 would stop somebody other than the local authority buying land.<br><br>
Increasingly, local authorities are finding opportunities for comprehensive redevelopment in which the private sector, as part of the arrangements, will do what is good for amenities in the area. No doubt my hon. Friend will agree that we want to have all hands to this plough and not exclude anyone, which is why the power should remain in its present form. No doubt my hon. Friend can envisage other circumstances in which a developer, a housing association or other interested body would be able to benefit.<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) would, in a general sense, help improve public health. I gave the example of an amenity area that might be worked on by a private developer and provide more light and cleaner air in a cramped part of a city. Such an area would of itself improve public health.<br><br>
My reason for thinking that the amendment would not help is simply that the expression "public health standards" is much wider and refers to more precise matters than are contained in the Bill on housing and local government. A reference to improving water supplies might reasonably be covered by public health, as might a reference to medical provisions and many other issues. The great triumphs of the 19th century were perhaps, the improvement in water supplies and similar facilities which did so much for public health.<br><br>
The sort of improvements and developments that we envisage in renewal areas would play a great part in improving public health. The specific phrase in the amendment would direct attention to an area not covered by the Bill but which might be covered by others. Health is a reasonable and acceptable subject to be covered by the Bill, but not in as precise terms as the hon. Member for Truro proposes. I assure him that the Government intend to consider these issues in a public health context. One of the reasons for the introduction of renewal areas was the improvement of the general environment, because that would do much for individual and general health. We are becoming ever more aware of the fact that the causes of many illnesses include a strong environmental element and that better housing and environment do much to protect people from them.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 548, in page 78, line 9, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) provide information, advice and assistance free of charge to house holders wishing to carry out any necessary improvement works to their homes including works for which assistance is being or has been provided under Part VIII of this Act.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to the provision of advisory services. It is an essential element of a successful revitalisation policy to provide advice, information, encouragement and assistance for people in these areas.<br><br>
When I served in the Department, I was greatly impressed by the work done by neighbourhood
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0964">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
revitalisation services. In 30 areas of the country these were schemes which covered 100,000 people. However, generous the grants, many householders need advice and assistance to set about improving their homes. I have particularly vivid memories of visiting Gloucester and Walthamstow. In the latter, the middle of an urban renewal area there was a show house which had been provided by collaboration between the local authority, a building society and a local contractor. Local people went along to see how a home in their street could be improved. Without a proposal such as amendment No. 548 contains, a component of the strategy would be missing.<br><br>
Under the proposed Government scheme, the resources test will exclude a number of better-off householders from direct financial help. We understand this and can debate it when we reach the relevant part of the Bill. Without the support of all sections of a community, the renewal area concept will not succeed. Because grants will not be available as of right to everyone living in houses that are in disrepair, it is essential that local authorities provide them with information on how to set about improving their home. I should not object if a local authority subcontracted this part of its obligations to an agency, such as Neighbourhood Revitalisation Services under the excellent direction of the National Home Improvement Council. The Government must make it clear that there will be a push behind this initiative in areas that are so declared and that there will not be only a low-profile announcement with people not knowing how to obtain grants.<br><br>
Model houses should be provided in these areas showing how properties can be converted and illustrating the services that are available for properties, so that people who are not eligible for a grant can be advised how to get a topping-up mortgage, with reliable contractors being allowed to explain how they would set about improving areas. In particular, information should be available to the elderly, who are sometimes confused by the whole process of getting work done. They may have to leave their home while work is being carried out. All this needs to be talked through with them by an impartial adviser.<br><br>
I hope that my right hon. Friend will recognise that excellent work has been done and will build on it by ensuring that information will be available free of charge locally to those who wish to work with the Government to improve the areas in which they live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young), although it will not greatly help his cause.<br><br>
This is an important matter because people living in renewal areas will be in the hands of professionals, often in circumstances where the local authority or someone else has already made a decision and commitments are already made. In that context, it is essential that they be allowed to obtain independent advice, as the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton said, to enable them to judge clearly what is appropriate, proper and possible. Often people cannot do that without advice.<br><br>
I do not wish to be controversial, but I will draw a parallel with estates action which undertook a project in Tower Hill in my constituency. The key is that the residents of the neighbourhood who were to be affected by improvements in the layout of the estate could be consulted by professionals who, strictly speaking, were not part of the local authority or connected with someone who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
had an axe to grind. The project has been extremely successful. The key to its success was the fact that people were consulted and given access to proper, independent advice.<br><br>
There is a similar parallel with housing co-operatives. When people are given the opportunity to set the pace and form of neighbourhood renewal, they do it more successfully than bureaucrats and professionals in isolation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with all the arguments that have been advanced. Much of the antagonism about changes in local areas can be avoided merely by people understanding their experiences. Often it is a question of being alive to these experiences, rather than presenting people with information in an unfamiliar form because the experts understand and like it. We know that from reading the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who is not with us, waxed eloquent on the need to speak in language that is both English and comprehensible. I agree entirely. He is a Welsh speaker which perhaps is why he is so keen on English being perfect. It is often said that the Welsh speak English better than the English. I am not sure whether I support that view.<br><br>
Clause 81 requires authorities to provide information about the assistance available to householders who wish to carry out works, as well as details of the plans and progress generally. In addition, clause 131 empowers them to provide advice and assistance to householders carrying out repairs and improvements, with or without charge being made. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton will probably agree that in some circumstances it would be proper to charge some people for certain services. It should not be impossible to make a charge although, in general, one would wish to make such information an integral part of the scheme. Clause 131 also enables local authorities to provide financial assistance to other bodies that offer advice and assistance of that kind.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) would probably agree—this seemed to be the burden of the hon. Gentleman's argument—that in some circumstances it may be better if local authorities were not the ones to provide such advice. It may be better for a local voluntary organisation or local group of experts known to the area to do so. That is why clause 131 gives local authorities the power to provide the money to enable others to give the advice.<br><br>
Although my hon. Friend's amendment was well intended, it is unnecessary. It should not be impossible for a local authority to make a charge for a particular part of that advice to some people who can afford to pay for it, so that the generality of ratepayers or charges payers should not have to bear that cost. In general my hon. Friend's point is well taken, but perhaps he will agree that the Bill covers that aspect.<br><br>
Moreover, in our general presentation of this action, the Government intend to do everything possible to encourage local authorities to do as my hon. Friend would wish—that is, to present the plans in a comprehensible form. They should be seen as a whole, their progress should be properly monitored and explained, and notice should be

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 989</span>
given of the next stages. That is how we envisage the process and there is no difference between the two sides of the Committee about the need for such information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his handsome response. I assume that he resists the amendment because in certain circumstances it would stop local authorities charging when it would be reasonable so to do. That is a sensible argument. My right hon. Friend also made it clear that the Bill provides for local authorities to do what we both wish. Therefore, I assume that when it makes sense it would be possible for a local authority to encourage neighbourhood revitalisation services to proceed on an agency basis, as they already do. Given that background, I agree with my right hon. Friend that there is little difference between us.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 706, in page 79, line 32, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'subject to a minimum contribution of 50 per cent. of the cost.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to discover what contribution central Government should make to the renewal of housing and to tackling extensive housing problems. The amendments would ensure that Ministers live up to the admission in the Bill that there is a problem and that the Government contribute to the solution. An unselected amendment tabled by the Labour party proposes that all funds should be contributed by the Exchequer. These amendments propose a minimum figure but do not detract from the clause, which allows application to be made to extend the 50 per cent. level if necessary.<br><br>
The problems cannot be underestimated. The English house condition survey 1986 had a different basis from the 1981 survey so comparison is difficult. Some information can be gleamed from it because it was more detailed than the 1981 survey.<br><br>
The figures identify changes. Dwellings lacking basic amenities fell from 905,000 in 1981 to 543,000 in 1986, which is a positive change. In my constituency, many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
people are on low incomes and there is high unemployment. There are many old, rural dwellings and certain people seem to suffer more from poor housing conditions.<br><br>
The number of unfit dwellings fell only slightly, due more to the number of buildings being erected and the changes that that created in terms of percentages than to any improvement. That was also true of the number of buildings in serious disrepair.<br><br>
The survey shows that 2·5 per cent. of the stock lacked basic amenities, half of which comprises houses built before 1900. Almost a third of the total was vacant when surveyed although a fair proportion was being renovated. Ninety nine per cent. of dwellings now have inside bathrooms. It would be interesting to know how that figure breaks down across the country. I suspect that the figures would be very different if localities were compared. The number of dwellings without inside facilities is high in Cornwall, especially in areas where people are on low incomes.<br><br>
Three quarters of dwellings had central heating and 90 per cent. roof insulation; 10 per cent. were inadequately heated and 11·4 per cent. had inadequate wiring, of which half needed rewiring.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean to be controversial, but the hon. Gentleman should reflect, as we rightly concentrate on dwellings that do not have proper facilities, how remarkable it is that the standards that we regard as proper and normal have changed so much for the better in the past 20 years. We talk about central heating as normal although I dare say that most members of the Committee were brought up in houses where it would have been considered an immense luxury. We live in a society that regards as standard provisions that previous generations would not have thought possible. The improvements have been remarkable. They are not the result of the action by any particular Government and they are not a party-political issue, but sometimes we should say how pleased we are at the huge change in general standards for most people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if we went back far enough we could make a comparison with mud huts and caves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty with this survey, as with previous surveys, is that the general needs index has been weighted towards housing lacking basic amenities. In practice that has meant houses that lacked inside lavatories, which is a prime factor in cities such as the one which I represent in part. Leeds has rows of back-to-back terrace houses without inside lavatories or bathrooms. It seems that those conducting the survey regard installing an inside lavatory as massively upgrading the stock although people do not have central heating, large bathrooms, showers or upgraded kitchens.<br><br>
If the needs index is weighted towards the lack of basic amenities it can distort the picture of how much housing has been upgraded. There is a long way to go. At best the survey shows that the condition of housing stock is standing still. It is certainly not improving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall discuss precisely that issue later. I think it worth examining the figures, and I suspect that other members of the Committee will wish to do so.<br><br>
Five per cent. of the stock—a large percentage for one of the wealthiest countries in the world—was assessed as unfit for human habitation as defined by section 604 of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0966">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 991</span>
Housing Act 1985. Two million dwellings were classified as being in a poor environment, with inner London containing the highest percentage with 25 per cent. of all dwellings.<br><br>
The private rented sector, upon which the Government's housing policy places such emphasis, has easily the worst conditions. Forty two per cent. of dwellings in the private rented sector were in poor condition compared with only 13 per cent. of owner-occupied homes, 11 per cent. of local authority homes and 7 per cent. of housing association homes.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the distribution of housing problems centres in the urban and rural deprived areas, so the concentrations are greater than the overall figures suggest. In my constituency many of the problems arise in the private sector through tenanted accommodation that has stood for many hundreds of years in some instances. People still live in conditions that no member of the Committee would regard as fit. They tend to be elderly people who have lived in them all their lives and have seen no improvement. All too often they have seen the stock run down as a result of landlords not putting in the necessary investment.<br><br>
The figures also covered the changes that have taken place. The number of unfit dwellings and those in serious disrepair has changed very little. The percentage decreases for unfitness and disrepair reflect the increase in overall stock in 1986 more than any improvement in condition.<br><br>
The rate of deterioration of stock into these categories was broadly in line with repair and improvement activity. Most of the slight improvement in conditions can be explained by the 155,000 dwellings demolished or no longer used as dwellings by 1986. In the longer term, the number of unfit dwellings has changed relatively little during the past 15 years.<br><br>
The household interview survey—which is very important, considering the sort of people involved—shows that elderly people, black and ethnic minority households, single people, people on low incomes and tenants of private landlords are the worst housed. Householders aged over 75 in particular endure the worst conditions in terms of unfitness and lack of amenities. That group occupies one third of all dwellings without all amenities and 16 per cent. of unfit housing. Also among those badly housed were single householders below retirement age, of whom 23 per cent. lived in accommodation in poor condition, which in part is a reflection of their concentration in the private rented sector.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The Government's gloss on the report, which accompanied its launch, claimed that the condition of the country's housing stock was improving significantly. The best that I think we can say—the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has already made the point—is that, in most areas of housing improvement, it is standing still. The change in definitions of disrepair makes comparisons with 1981 very difficult, yet through it we can see that all that the Government have really done is redefine the problem and therefore reduce the supposed cost of repairing the housing stock.<br><br>
In a much more detailed survey of the need for the repair and improvement of local authority stock in England, conducted by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities in 1985 prices, the cost was put at around £19 billion. After that report was launched, the Department of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
the Environment criticised the survey's figures, but concluded from its own survey of all local authorities in England that the cost of improving and repairing the local authority housing stock was £18,800 million—so there was hardly room for criticism. Those two latter surveys of the council sector were based on a much larger sample than the 1986 house condition survey, so they should be considered to be more accurate.<br><br>
No one can deny the urgent need for a significant increase in the level of public and private investment in the nation's housing stock. The Government's proposals in the Bill do little to encourage an increase in, and in many respects will restrict, investment. The 1991 house condition survey—if there ever is one; perhaps the Minister will tell us if there will be—will show that the rate of deterioration of the nation's housing stock has been allowed to continue unchecked.<br><br>
All of this must be accepted by the Minister—it is confirmed by his Department's figures. That is presumably the reason for this clause being in the Bill, yet the Bill does not specify any Government help. It merely allows the Secretary of State to take powers to whichever percentage he believes appropriate, as and when he believes appropriate.<br><br>
I suppose that we should be grateful that the Minister accepts that, on some occasions, that may be necessary, but I strongly believe that we should write into the Bill that the Exchequer will make at least a minimum contribution towards the cost of the renewal programmes. This is a national issue, not a local authority one. We are talking about people's most basic meeds, which vary from local authority to local authority, so there is no way in which the Government can predict accurately the needs of a local authority in meeting those difficulties. The cost is enormous, and we should not rely on Ministers to meet it through local authority financing and the Exchequer contribution, nor do I believe that it can be met through the poll tax, which would impose a heavy and unfair burden.<br><br>
The amendments are straightforward. They make it compulsory for Government to make a contribution and to set a minimum level on it. The Committee should accept our proposals. The Minister should reflect on the fact that, in many ways, it is arguable that the entire burden should be borne by the Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We believe that the principle underlying the amendments should be adopted and that the amendments are helpful. In our view, the 75 per cent. and 90 per cent. contributions of the past would be sensible, although obviously local authorities would refer a 100 per cent. direct contribution to renewal and improvement programmes. It is wrong that housing investment programmes should have to bear the cost, the direct contribution which, as the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) said, is varied and unpredictable in different parts of the country and would be difficult to calculate in overall investment programme allocations.<br><br>
The renewal of housing stock—public and private; owner-occupied and council—is more than an important social issue in terms of the conditions in which people live; it is an important national economic issue in terms of the bill that will have to be picked up by future generations. What we do not do now will cost others a great deal more later. It is therefore the Government's responsibility to pick up the bill with no equivocation. That would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0967">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 993</span>
significantly accelerate the renewal programme which I described earlier as a partnership, a responsibility of both national and local government, and something to which all parties should devote much more attention than they have in the past.<br><br>
We must bear in mind the social consequences, the environment in which people live and its contribution to health and ill-health, and the cost to the nation of the lack of well-being of youngsters, the elderly and the chronically ill. Such things depend, to a large extent, on whether we as a nation pick up the total cost. That is why Opposition Members believe that the Government should make a direct and definable contribution. It should not be left to the vagaries of Ministers bringing forward proposals at a later date. It is important to have the matter clarified this morning.<br><br>
There has been no improvement in the housing stock over the past 10 years, and that is why all of us should be worried. Leaving aside the 155,000 dwellings that have been demolished since 1981, it is clear that there has been no definable improvement in the overall percentage of stock in the new category of unfit and the target category. It is difficult to be sure about the figures, as has already been said, because of changing definitions, but it is generally accepted tha things have not improved. The statistics that are available for inner-city areas, as well as those that represent the unseen and unsung problems in rural areas, present grave difficulties to local authorities that are trying to move forward when they do not know how much the Government will contribute.<br><br>
There is the difficulty of local authorities being constrained to developing programmes. There will be no imperative to examine the stock in the area if the Bill goes through unamended. I hope that Ministers will ensure that proper surveys of stock are carried out by local authorities—there is no such requirement in the Bill, although there was one in the 1985 legislation—and that clear information will be given about the resources that will be made available by the Government for a number of years ahead. Without any knowledge of the money that is to be made available, local authorities are expected to define and declare renewal areas, although the Bill expects them to do that in accordance with the resources that are available. That is a Catch-22 situation for local authorities who have to make forward plans and work with local communities to decide whether their areas should be declared renewal areas.<br><br>
In inner London,71 per cent. of local authority housing falls into one of the two categories I have mentioned. A staggering 72 per cent. of owner-occupiers and 91 per cent. of the private rented sector, fall into those two categories. In London, 1·8 million households fall into one of them. The scale of the problem varies from dwellings which lack the most basic amenities to the 900,000 dwellings which are considered unfit for human occupation.<br><br>
The figures are so high that they override any ideological belief that the market will solve the problem. The Bill accepts that intervention is required. It is important that the Government make a clear declaration of their contribution over and above the investment programmes and the new credit totals allowable to local authorities for borrowing.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
One third of people who live in unft accommodation are aged over 65. Their health will be a cost to the community. They will not be able to bear the cost of renovation, improvement or renewal. At their age, they cannot take out a mortgage if they are owner-occupiers, neither can they borrow the money in some other way and make their contribution. It is unlikely that they or their families will have cash available. It is critical that they know whether the Government will do something. If they do not, as I said, the cost will have to be picked up somehow. The Government should be making a hard-headed, economic calculation to discover whether it would cost less to invest in the future now than to pass to future generations the cost of doing what should have been done a long time ago.<br><br>
None of us argues that the sky is the limit. In an experiment in 1981–82, people were offered 90 per cent. grants, and told that the sky was the limit. It was not long before the then Secretary of State had to intervene. I do not want to be unkind to Conservative Members, but the experiment lasted long enough to make a significant contribution to the result of the 1983 general election. There were, of course, other factors at play in that result, but it was unfortunate that local authorities, the owners of private rented accommodation and owner-occupiers were not quicker off the mark. Some local authorities are still coping with the resentment and frustration of people who slammed in applications which were not dealt with. Some roofs are in such bad condition that they leak and cause damp, which causes ill health.<br><br>
The Opposition are committed to public investment in the renewal of our housing stock and to overcoming the problems. There should be a programme for tackling the necessary £19 billion of investment. If we could agree that, we would make the same contribution to improved health in the 1990s that the public health movement made 100 years ago when it recognised that government, and social policy on one issue has a significant impact on others. Cutting public expenditure may help balance the books and reduce intervention now, but it undoubtedly ensures that other bills must be picked up, publicly and privately in terms of health, wellbeing, the environment and, ultimately, the level of investment needed to put the problems right.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How on earth we can assess the problems? The English house condition survey of 1986, to which other members of the Committee have referred uses revised methodology and definitions. For example, it changes the definition of disrepair and uses new methods of assessing repair costs.<br><br>
It is important to read such documents, but we must also be able to understand and interpret them. This is the Government par excellence who believe that truth is achieved by presentation, and that the presentation of information is the key to how it is interpreted and understood. News management has become more important than the facts, however objectively they may be arrived at and agreed upon.<br><br>
It is difficult to understand the English house condition survey. Its assessment and methodology differs from that of the 1981 survey, so it is not easy to make clear comparisons. The problem is a little like those that result
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0968">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 995</span>
from changing methods of calculating how many people are in employment and the row about whether to take mortgage payments out of the inflation index.<br><br>
There is also a difficulty with language. The Minister is rightly worried. We are obliged to know that some members of the Government are interested in the use of words. Different definitions creep in. When we discuss rents, we slip from rents to affordable rents to market rents. The terms sometimes seem interchangeable.<br><br>
The house condition survey introduces the new concept of dwellings in "poor condition". Definitions have changed to mean homes lacking one or more of the basic amenities. I said in an intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) that, at best, the survey can be presented as saying that the condition of the stock is standing still. However, the Government press release that greeted the survey's publication suggested that the condition of Britain's housing stock is improving significantly. That is a case of news management, not the truth about what is happening.<br><br>
Although the survey revised the language and the definition of disrepair and introduced new methods of assessing repair costs, a helpful change was that the information was gathered on the most detailed survey form ever. The Department at least sought more information than had ever been collected before. The difficulty is that the information was not put together in the report.<br><br>
I shall refer to a question that I tabled for the Minister to answer and to which I hope to receive a written reply in due course. The information on conditions was gathered in interviews in reply to questions 21 to 23c, 24 to 26, 28 to 42, 44 and 48, but the answers did not appear in the report. Will the Minister give us information and tables about tenure, income, the age of the head of the household and employment status? Will he describe the condition of the housing and the people who live in it?<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Truro rightly says, the poor live in the poorest housing. That fact would emerge clearly from the answers that were not published in the English housing condition survey. I hope that the Minister will say, "The answers are readily available on the survey forms at the Department. They can be put in the Library so that everyone is clear what they are."<br><br>
There is a new concept for dwellings in "poor condition". The survey suggests that 2,868,000 dwellings were in "poor condition", 2,430,000 of which were in poor repair. If poor condition is defined as lacking one or more basic amenities it can simply mean that, like many terraced houses in northern towns and, I imagine, homes in rural areas, a dwelling does not have an inside lavatory. If people have inside lavatories put in their homes, they suddenly come out of the category of "poor condition". At that point the definition starts to cover up the number of people living in housing conditions that are unacceptable and inappropriate by modern standards.<br><br>
The fact that people live in housing that is not in "poor condition" does not mean that they have central heating, to which the Minister referred, or modern bathrooms. Advertisements that recommend people to change their whole bathroom suite if they do not like the colour of the present one are an insult to people who do not have an inside lavatory or a decent bathroom supplied with a hot water system. Many people are without those basic housing needs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
The Minister talks about the number of houses and homes that are unfit and which need to be seen to. The statistics are striking. Even the Government's survey shows that 42 per cent. of such dwellings are in the private rented sector, where there is an enormous job to be done. I assume that those houses have not stood empty and unoccupied. People are paying rent for them. This is the Government who, in a previous Bill, said that we should expand the private rented sector. If so, something should be done about the fact that almost half of the private rented dwellings are below acceptable standards. The figure of 42 per cent. for the private sector compares badly with the figure of 13 per cent. for owner-occupiers, 11 per cent. for local authorities and 7 per cent. for housing associations. It is often suggested that the large council house stock is in mass disrepair. Even from this survey it is plain that the private rented sector is more at fault.<br><br>
I shall not object if the Minister replies, "We ought to do something about it," and says that local authorities should be able to provide grants. I should welcome that suggestion. Everyone, regardless of tenure, has the right to a home of a decent, modern standard.<br><br>
We return to our basic argument on the clause. The Government must accept that the housing stock is a resource of the whole nation. It is not the responsibility of one individual to pay the whole cost of bringing a property up to modern standards within his lifetime and solely from his income. Housing should be an asset of the whole nation in which we invest from the common Treasury.<br><br>
We should say, "The condition of the housing stock does not stand still because of weathering and other factors. It is like an organic resource, and must be regularly brought up to date." Unless we are prepared to use the nation's resources, a massive backlog of disrepair will build up.<br><br>
The backlog has been highlighted before. The facts were spelt out in a report put together by the Duke of Edinburgh a few years ago, and a couple of years ago the Royal Institute of British Architects drew attention to the declining standards of Britain's housing stock. Dare I suggest to the Minister that "Faith in the City", which had a large section on housing, also referred to the declining state of British housing stock? We should be putting resources into improving that stock. We could start by accepting a common definition of the problem, by that I mean that I hope that the Minister will be willing to publish what lies behind the survey.<br><br>
In his intervention in the speech of the hon. Member for Truro, the Minister referred to central heating. What written material was used to instruct the surveyors how to interpret categories of rising and penetrating damp, slight and serious mould growth, excessive draughts and the number of houses with seriously defective, just acceptable, satisfactory or unknown dampness? Without knowing what those categories mean, it is difficult to assess the conditions that people live in.<br><br>
In case the Minister and his Department do not think that that really matters, I can assure them that it can make a massive difference in practice, for example, when a housing manager or a landlord tells a tenant, who knows that his property and the clothing in his wardrobe are wet, that the problem is damp and subsequently says that it is caused by condensation. We need to be specific and accurate about the terms we use in making such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0969">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 997</span>
assessments. It is not as if technology, science and the ability of architects and technicians cannot estimate and work out the causes. They can.<br><br>
I can only assume that surveyors were given written instructions to do that survey and that information could be made available to the House about what lies behind the survey. Perhaps we could then agree on the scale of the problem and the need to tackle the backlog of repairs to Britain's housing stock. That may result in our saying that it is not right for one individual during his lifetime or tenancy, to tackle that backlog from his income and that we should invest for the future in the key asset of housing stock, whether it is public or private.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly because many of the major points have ben made. When the Minister intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) to make the point that housing standards had improved, I felt—I cannot have been the only one—that that showed all the hallmarks of the Government's complacency on this issue. Obviously, the general standard of housing stock has improved, just as the health of the nation has improved. Nevertheless, we should be worried when we see that infant mortality is higher in this country than in others, and we should recognise that a large part of our housing stock is in poor condition. Indeed, the housing stock condition report, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) pointed out, does not give a clean bill of health to the housing investment policies of the Government, or the country. We are capable of doing more and better.<br><br>
My hon. Friends said, accurately, that the Government should recognise that housing is of value to the health, welfare and general performance of the community as a whole. It is a community asset. If the Secretary of State seriously accepted that, he would recognise that it is the Government's duty to provide funds for such housing. Furthermore, the Government should not be talking about 50 per cent. but 75 per cent. or 100 per cent. because we are talking about the renewal of seriously run-down areas that affect not only people's lives but the genral health and welfare of the community.<br><br>
Last Monday afternoon, at St. Bartholomew's hospital, I spoke to health visitors and environmental health officers. On the same morning, the Minister for Health and his hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mellor) also spoke to them. I do not know what response they received. I know only that in the afternoon there was overwhelming agreement among health visitors, environmental health officers, doctors, nurses and a large audience related to the medical and social work profession—predominately the medical profession—that something desperate was happening in the worst areas of housing. Obviously, they referred to the homeless on the streets and people in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, but they also referred to general housing conditions, houses in multiple occupation and so on.<br><br>
How can the Government be so complacent when we know from recent reports that houses in multiple occupation are desperately short of fire escapes? Fires in such houses have killed many people, yet the Government feel that that is not their concern. They have not made provision in the Bill to provide funds for those houses.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 998</span>
Earlier this week, I pointed out to those health visitors that it would be easy to sit down and write a list of health conditions that were adversely affected by poor housing. If I were to do so, I could filibuster by going through a range of conditions from infections at one end of the scale to general stress and depression at the other, which often relates to child battery and abuse.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
The circumstances in which poor housing impacts on the community are strong and well documented. The Health Visitors Association under the auspices of the Medical Services Council, a branch of the British Medical Association, produced a good report, which was exceptionally interesting. I recommend that report to the Minister. It was about the social and health effects of poor housing. The report listed many factors that I touched on previously.<br><br>
I know that conditions have improved. It would be rather strange if they had not. However, it is complacent for the Minister simply to make that statement and then say that not much more can be done other than what local authorities can do within their resources. The Government should declare that a major aim is to end bad housing conditions over a period of time. If that is done, many other problems will diminish. Not only would some of the burden on the Health Service diminish if we improved the health of families in poor housing, but educational performance would also improve. We know that children in overcrowded or poor housing conditions perform less well at school.<br><br>
It is also true that some of the general problems of bad behaviour, whether criminal or acts of vandalism, would decline. We know that the social skills of young children are seriously affected and tend to be retarded if they live in poor housing conditions. We know that truancy tends to be linked with bad housing. Many problems stem from poor housing and that should give any Government not only a moral conscience but, equally, in terms of the economic efficiency of the nation the will to say that bad housing must be eliminated.<br><br>
We know that we are paying a social and economic price for areas of run-down housing, overcrowded housing and housing in multiple occupation, which is well in excess of the price we would pay for putting housing right in a well planned programme over a period of years. I am sure that that would receive all-party support if the Government had the courage and vision to bring that proposal forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes it is necessary for us to balance our concentration on that which is bad with our appreciation of that which is good. It is sad that any attempt to do so is called complacency. Anyone who represents a rural constituency, as I do, with considerable pockets of deprivation, knows that housing conditions are often ignored because houses are thatched and seen to be quaint, so do not have the force of back-to-back urban deprivation. We know that there are real areas of considerable housing failure. Therefore, I welcome the Bill's presentation of various ways in which to deal with those failures and difficulties.<br><br>
We must recognise that bad housing can never be eradicated if "bad" continues to be redefined. We are trying to ensure that our standards of what is acceptable continue to rise. We do not want a permanent baseline so that once a house is above it, it is treated forever as though
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V007P0I0970">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 999</span>
it were in reasonable condition. We hope that the economic conditions that have been such a feature of the past 10 years will provide an opportunity for better standards and for more people to enjoy those better standards. At the same time, minimum standards must rise.<br><br>
On the basis of my past actions and an assessment of my strong views on housing, I cannot be criticised for complacency, but I hope that I can assert the need for a balanced view. We shall gain much more from looking at the facts—accepting the good as well as the bad—than from concentrating on extreme and hyped-up versions of them, such as we heard from the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not look so extreme if one is living in such conditions.<br><br>
Yesterday I was in East Anglia—primarily in Norwich—talking about housing conditions there. One matter that should trouble the Minister is the recognition by both Conservative and Labour authorities that they cannot transfer people in council houses who need to be transferred or take in people from the private sector, which is especially necessary in areas such as Norwich which contain many multiple occupation houses. The queue for council housing, which the Government claim is so unpopular, is becoming longer all the time because local authorities are not allowed to build. If the Minister is worried about problems in rural areas, why does he not allow both Labour and Tory local authorities to do something about them and provide the resources for them to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of all the housing authorities to which the hon. Gentleman might have referred, Norwich is, if not the worst—many authorities fight for that title—certainly a dreadful authority. It has had a policy of municipalisation for years, and we had to intervene to enforce the right to buy. It is thoroughly badly run, but the hon. Gentleman will not persuade me to discuss Norwich. If he wishes to see how housing can be run, let me take him to my constituency and show him how a decent local authority runs its housing.<br><br>
Anyone who thinks that Norwich is a rural area cannot have been there for long. I am worried about the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of rural areas if he believes that Norwich is one. When he is next in East Anglia, perhaps he will go to areas that are really rural and where there are problems such as those to which I referred.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) has the same problem in his constituency. Owner-occupied houses were often bought before the war for very little money and are often lived in by older people who find it difficult to pay the costs. I commend to the Committee the new system of improvement grants, which will allow for mandatory grants to enable such people to improve their houses and which will target the grants on those who most need them. That is exactly what the hon. Member for Leeds, West wants, and what my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke is constantly pressing us to do. I am well aware of the problem from my constituency experience.<br><br>
We can deal with these matters only if we maintain a sense of proportion about the standards we are seeking. It is to take a peculiar view of the changes to start by saying, "We shall ignore the fact that a large number of houses that were unfit have been pulled down: they do not count."
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1000</span>
But those houses have been replaced by other houses. When an area is demolished, it is redeveloped and other houses are built in it. The new houses are of a higher standard and are part of the improvement that we referred to. We are also asked to ignore the fact that the number of unfit houses—without basic amenities—has fallen from 5 per cent. to 3 per cent. of the housing stock. We are supposed to ignore that figure and to say that there has been no real improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, but first I have to correct the hon. Gentleman. I have a great deal to say about the hon. Gentleman's speech, because it was filled with inaccuracies. The hon. Gentleman wanted me to move rapidly backwards and forwards between houses lacking basic amenities and houses that are not up to standard. Of course, a house can be changed from a state of lacking basic amenities—of which there are many more than an inside lavatory—and still be a house of the kind that most of us would feel needed to be upgraded. The hon. Gentleman—rightly—said that the second category has not improved as much as we would wish.<br><br>
I wish to concentrate on these questions, but I cannot do that entirely on this amendment, because much of what has been said on it will be said under part VIII of the Bill, when it will be more in order. I shall therefore concentrate on the amendment but give way to the hon. Gentleman first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give me figures for the number of houses—public and private—that were cleared and replaced between the years 1961 and 1981—figures which would have appeared in the 1981 survey; the figures between 1981 and now; and even those for the years between 1981 and the year of the survey. The right hon. Gentleman might agree that most of the clearance and replacement happened well before this survey was undertaken and well before the 1981 survey was undertaken. It is difficult to make comparisons—I notice that some Conservative Members agree with me—as the definitions have been changed, but the difference between the survey in 1981 and the present date will give us the crucial figures. The Minister should not suggest that all the improvement work has been carried out between 1981 and now, because the clearance and replacement programme has not run only since 1981—it started earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to answer the hon. Gentleman's point. He asked us to ignore a whole range of matters for which the indices are good, and to concentrate only on those for which the indices are bad. All I am saying is that that is not a very sensible way to make comparisons. But I am approaching some of the ways in which we ought to make improvements.<br><br>
The questions that I have been asked are important ones. First, it was put to me that it is important to get the facts, and the surveys, right. I can assure the Committee that there will be a 1991 survey. No one except the hon. Member for Leeds, West ever thought that there would not be. That is a technique usually used by Liberals. There was a wonderful example on the Isle of Wight, for example, when the Liberal party said, "The theatre is in danger: it is to be closed." A great deal of fuss was made, and the district council finally had to say that it had never had any intention of closing the theatre. The Liberal candidate then said, "We saved the theatre."</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did I say that? Check the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know why the hon. Gentleman is so cross. It is because the most insulting thing to say about anybody is that he uses a Liberal technique. Liberals are, without doubt, the nastiest fighters in elections of any group of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I want to be abject in my apologies. I did not realise how insulting I had been. All the hon. Gentleman asked was whether there would be a 1991 survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not ask that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that that was what the hon. Gentleman asked. I shall be even more abject and say that if there ever was any doubt, there will be a 1991 survey, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not deny me the opportunity of saying something about which we probably both agree and which I have now managed to get off my chest.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), with his usual acumen, pressed us on the need for local surveys. We shall table an amendment to the Bill that will cover the hon. Gentleman's requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) asked about the survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. It really was a Liberal technique, in that case.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West waxed lyrical on the use of language, which I always find interesting. He said that the Government say that sometimes rents are "reasonable", "market" or "affordable", and that sometimes there is an inter-relation and they are used as if they meant the same thing. In some circumstances, that is true: sometimes reasonable market rents are affordable. The three words sometimes mean different things. A reasonable rent is one that we in the Committee would find reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The tenant might not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am simply suggesting that it could still be called "reasonable". A market rent is one that may be paid if the property is on the market. An affordable rent is one that someone can afford to pay. Those are three perfectly reasonable words and if we cannot use the English language, I wonder which language the hon. Member for Leeds, West would like to use. The hon. Gentleman should try to avoid the central Socialist trap. I am not accusing the Liberals, although I would if I could. The hon. Gentleman said that 42 per cent. of private rented accommodation lacked the amenities that it should have. He knows that that is because for years, the anti-private-landlord views of the Labour party stopped landlords charging a reasonable rent, so that they could not repair their houses. A Labour Housing Minister said, "I hate private landlords," so it is no wonder that we are in this position.<br><br>
It has happened only in Britain, because people have not been so stupid elsewhere. Such politics are a hangover from that dead and discredited 19th century Victorian fraud, Kark Marx.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only one question for the Minister. How long have the Government been in office?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would remember the glorious day in 1979 when the boundaries of Socialism began to roll away. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman will live long enough to see the day when the Conservative Government leave office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that as a threat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Truro wants me to include him in my attack.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister a simple non-Socialist question: has he any evidence that the quality of property under landlords has deteriorated significantly since the Rent Acts came into force? If he looks back, I think that he will find that private rented property has always been low-quality and low-standard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That betrays an ignorance of 19th century history which I regret in a member of a party whose last recorded real power was in that century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only in a sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, there was a bit of hangover, with one or two rather curious figures in the 20th century, but the great period of Liberalism was a time when private rented accommodation was among the best in the country—not because of the Liberal party, but because of the way in which the housing system worked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I take the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) a stage further? The Minister is aware, because his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary wrote to me recently on the subject, that there has been a steady decline in the number of private landlords during the 10 years that his Government have been in office. So it is disingenuous to try to put the blame on the Labour party, when the decline has been steady since 1979 and is now down to less than 8 per cent. I also asked his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary whether he expected an increase, in the light of the Housing Act 1988, but he declined to comment, and I can only assume that he does not expect the sector to increase.<br><br>
There is a further point. The right hon. Gentleman made much of the use of words. But if there is one thing of which Opposition Members are aware, it is that reasonable rents, affordable rents and market rents are all less fair than fair rents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for bouncing up on that point, but I had the pleasurable experience earlier this morning of being both Government and Opposition, and I am afraid that it has gone to my head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out, for the sake of the record, that it did not last very long—30 seconds, in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it did not last very long, but may I add that I thought that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) did enormously well when he was the sole representative of the Opposition in the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I resent the Minister's patronage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am the one person who can say that to the hon. Gentleman. None of his colleagues are in a position to compliment him, because they were not present at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1003</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) because the representative of the Patronage Secretary has suggested that I am enjoying myself too much and should get back to being boring, and I shall try to do that.<br><br>
However, I cannot resist making one comment, and I shall try to make it in a way that will not upset anyone. I am very worried about the constant reference to central heating. I take the matter very seriously. The part of the London house in which I live has no central heating, and what central heating there is was put in because my mother-in-law was very old. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I fear that she is no longer with us. So I belong to the extra-jumper variety. An index of the change in society is that it is not long since people who could well afford central heating would not dream of spending money on having it installed. Our attitudes have changed, and that is why we must be careful about say that it is always possible to overcome bad housing. We should remember that standards go on rising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give way because I want to come back to the amendment before I get into trouble.<br><br>
The amendment suggests that it should be obligatory to give money for a particular scheme in a renewal area. I take the point of the hon. Member for Truro seriously that there are variations between local authorities. Frankly, those schemes can have 75 per cent. or even 90 per cent. of Government money. Nothing in the Bill changes that. That happens now. I hope that we may be more flexible in using those schemes. Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that authorities can sometimes be in great difficulty, when it would be appropriate to provide not 50 per cent. but 90 per cent. or even 95 per cent.? I can think of other authorities—it would be embarrassing to mention them, because some are Conservative and some are Liberal—where local resources are considerable. A problem may be bad, but limited, and it may be more reasonable to give a much smaller contribution, perhaps even less than 50 per cent. It is not necessary to have that in the Bill. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I nearly mentioned the Sevenoaks authority but similar authorities with considerable resources have such problems.<br><br>
Would it be reasonable for primary legislation to say that the figure must always be more than 50 per cent? I shall tell the hon. Member for Truro what would happen. First, Governments less generous than ours would make the minimum into a maximum. The hon. Member for Truro cannot accuse me of being that kind of Minister. He certainly would not accuse my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State of being that kind of Minister; generosity is his hallmark. The Secretary of State has presided over some of the most generous changes in the Department. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman was not thinking of us. But some people might take the minimum of a maximum. I am not keen on the figure of 50 per cent. because it could make it less possible to go for 75 per cent. or 90 per cent.<br><br>
Neither would I like to say that a Government should have to give 50 per cent. to authorities with plenty of money. Such an authority should not have 50 per cent., but it might deserve 20 per cent. to help it on its way and encourage it. I would much prefer to have that freedom,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
particularly in the knowledge that we are now giving grants of up to 90 per cent. The hon. Gentleman need not be especially worried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will accept that nothing in the amendment prevents a higher grant. It sets a minimum of 50 per cent. In response to the Minister's first point about the possibility of an ungenerous Secretary of State, it is hard to see that a minimum of 50 per cent. would be more risky than one of 0 per cent. The inkling is that Ministers might more often move in the direction of 0 per cent. That is one reason for suggesting a minimum of 50 per cent.<br><br>
Surely it is right that the nation should accept that the housing stock should receive a certain level of investment through the Government. A level of 50 per cent. might also have the direct benefit—even more than the Minister's example of 20 per cent.—of encouraging a local authority to undertake that investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I envisage some Liberal luminaries of the past turning in their graves at that argument. It is a new argument for a Liberal. It means that when a locality has a problem is must turn to the nation for help even if it has the resources to solve the problem itself. That would not go down well in Liberal history. I doubt whether that is a principle of some of the later Liberals who, like so many others, I like to ignore.<br><br>
I am not being complacent about the nationwide problem. But surely it is sensible for the state's resources to be aimed first at the places which need it most. We must not prevent authorities that could cope with such needs on a local basis, with less than the current contributions of 75 per cent. or 90 per cent., from getting on with the job.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
If we insert into the Bill a contribution of 50 per cent., we would restrict the range of help that could be given by the state. It would not be advanced. We have never had a minimum contribution before, yet what have the Government done? Have they reduced the contribution to nil? No. They are giving grants of 75 per cent. or 90 per cent. It is unfair to accuse the Government of certain actions when they have shown the exact generosity that is wanted. I shall not be tempted to insert into the Bill a minimum contribution that would prevent me from doing the job that should be done. It would stop flexibility and prevent us from aiming help at those who need it most, while still giving a little help to those who do not need as much. I am sure that the Committee will agree.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West asked whether we would make the background material available. It is available. Any specific question the hon. Gentleman may wish to ask will be answered in full. We are now considering whether to issue more material about the supplementary reports; it is merely a matter of expense and whether that is the right way to proceed. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be cross with me about that, even though I have not convinced him of my argument on one or two other matters.<br><br>
I do not object to the generalities of "Faith in the City" but I agree with the Archbishop of York, who implied that chapter 3 of the document on theology was extremely poor. It would have been more helpful if the statistics on sociology, of which I have a great deal in my Department, had been expounded by some genuine theological thought. I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me an opportunity to say that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the Minister for agreeing to publish the answers to the questions in the survey. That will be helpful. He referred to the point made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) about central heating. Perhaps some of us would have more sympathy with his views if the took into account the real position. I detected a slight air of complacency in his comments in that conditions are improving generally, and most people have central heating, except those who prefer Arranwear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trippier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is your speech sponsored by?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case.<br><br>
There was a design fault in housing in the past. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, houses were designed to be heated by open fires. That meant that the whole shell of the building was heated. Two downstairs fires would operate as a sort of central heating system through the brickwork. That would be true in some of the traditional buildings in rural areas. In my constituency, 4,500 homes have one heating point, which is a gas fire in the living room. A coal fire would heat the entire building through the brickwork, but a gas fire system heats one room. The houses, which are due for rewiring, have only one three-pin point upstairs, usually on the landing, so the bedrooms cannot be heated using electricity.<br><br>
People do not have the heating methods to which the Minister referred, and that causes damp in many houses. The survey may reveal that we are a long way behind in providing people with homes that are warm and comfortable to live in. I urge the Minister not to be complacent about the problem of heating in homes, and not to dismiss it as a choice between central heating and, Arranwear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about that mix. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that proper heating in homes is essential. No one should suggest that I disagree with that view, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that heating in bedrooms, for example, is essential for those who are not sick. I have never had a heated bedroom in my life. The upstairs of my house has no heating and is not meant to have any.<br><br>
I am green enough to believe that we have a great deal to learn about the waste of heating. We should be able to discuss that without sounding complacent. Of course we need proper heating, but not heating that envelopes everyone in the warmth that we have here, where hon. Members are sitting in their shirtsleeves because we are overhot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This may not be the time to go into the matter in detail, but the Minister seems to have misunderstood what I was saying. The traditional heating method—an open fire—acted as insulation. Has the Minister insulation in his home? Is the temperature in his bedroom regularly below zero? Is there damp on his walls? Perhaps he does not mind those conditions, but if they exist, the condition of the property is declining and the building will fall down because it is rotting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about the conditions in which every house in the country operated in the past. The real way to destroy a house is to have central heating, because everything then starts to crack up.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, the Minister has missed the point. I am not asking for a fire in every room. The question is how to insulate a home and keep it warm. If the Minister is saying that the options are central heating or damp and ice, he may feel comfortable in his woolly jumper, but he is causing people to live in conditions that result in their becoming sick. The doctor gives them a note saying that they are living in conditions that are bad for their health and that their children's bronchitis and asthma are caused by the conditions in which they live.<br><br>
If the Minister wants to tell the medical profession that those assessments are wrong, he is free to do so. I suggest, however, that he has some responsibility for tackling the problem of people living in homes that are not comfortably warm, not insulated, not centrally heated and do not have fit heating of any kind. That emerges clearly from the survey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot match the Arran tendency or the vigour of the Minister's ablutions, which obviously keep him warm and comfortable of a winter's morning. Some of us remember getting up and finding double glazing that we did not know we had—frost and ice on the inside of the bedroom window, not just on the outside.<br><br>
I return the patronage compliment by saying that, after this morning, the Minister must go down as the funniest man on the Conservative Benches. I look forward to next week's episode.<br><br>
It is OK to say that there are differences in local authorities' resources and areas' wealth, and that there can be discrimination in the allocation of responsibility, but in setting credit limits and proposing considerable restrictions on the use of local resources for investment, the Government are attempting to have it both ways. They cannot say that credit limits and restrictions on the use of local resources to write off historic debt will be Government policy and at the same time decide not to have a national scheme that lays down a percentage contribution because they wish to be able to take account of resources in each locality. The two concepts do not square. The Minister was on slightly weak ground in trying to persuade us that more wealthy areas ought to be discriminated against in favour of worse-off areas that will need Government benevolence to tackle problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say what the hon. Member for Brightside said so well. I shall not delay the Committee by repeating it.<br><br>
I found the Minister's arguments against the amendments most unconvincing. In particular, he tried to pretend that, in terms of Ministers squeezing down help, it was somehow more dangerous for a local authority to have a minimum of 50 per cent. than to have no minimum. There is no logic in that. I find it hard to understand how a Minister could react in that way. I do not believe that the Committee should accept the hon. Gentleman"s argument. I wish to press this important matter to a Division. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly on the question of resources, having enjoyed the robust response of my right hon. Friend to the earlier debate on contribution percentages. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend can say whether he envisages spending more in the future under clause 85. The clause relates to his contributions; it does not cover home improvement grants, which are excluded under clause 82. As I understand it, it underpins the local authority expenditure that is mentioned in clause 82.<br><br>
It would be helpful for those who are interested in urban renewal to know whether my right hon. Friend the Minister anticipates there being more public expenditure, or less, under the new regime. Perhaps he can tell us how much was spent last year or this year, so that we can get the feel of whether this is an area of growing expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always pleased when my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) intervenes, and never more than now. It gives me an opportunity that I would not otherwise have to say that the purpose of this part of the Bill is to enable us to afford special priority to the expenditure aspect, to which I attach considerable importance.<br><br>
I have difficulty in answering directly the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton on proportionality. As he will recall from previous occasions, the total spending and how it is to be divided will soon be discussed with the Treasury. There are considerable pressures relating to new build and to how much of total housing spending will be available for, say, housing associations. That is why I cannot do as he wishes and give him better figures as, indeed, I should like.<br><br>
I give high priority to the renovation and renewal of stock and of areas. I see some interesting things as I travel round the country. I wish to complement the London borough of Islington, which has shown how much more valuable it can be to renovate than to build afresh. Renovation often produces homes that are much closer to the accommodation that we should like to provide than do some new buildings. For example, Marquis block is now subject to enormous change because of the appalling condition into which it has fallen since it was built only 10 years ago. Our priorities lie with renovation, and it will be our duty to see how much money we have to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for his response. I wish him every good fortune in the wholly friendly bilaterals between his Department and the Treasury.<br><br>
If the policy is to succeed it will involve some public expenditure. One way in which the success of the initiative will be judged is the extent to which resources are allocated as an indication of the Government's priority.</span></p>

POWERS OF ENTRY AND PENALTY FOR OBSTRUCTION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 626, in page 80, line 10, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'or the Secretary of State.'</p></blockquote>
This was intended to be a simple probing amendment to discover why the Secretary of State needed compulsory powers to enter a property. Now that I have concluded that both the Minister and his central heating are cracking up, which is the only explanation for some of his outbursts, I am more than ever convinced that no Secretary of State who gets anywhere near him should be allowed compulsory power to enter any property anywhere in the country. Apart from anything else, the Minister will probably use it to check that everyone is wearing a pullover. That appears to be his answer to some of the problems that people face, which is bizarre, to say the least.<br><br>
There are times when central heating is too high and when woolly jumpers are a good idea. There are others when it is necessary to have central heating and a good house that is looked after over a period of years and which is not damp because of faulty construction or heating. If we wish to be genuinely green, the debate says more about the need for proper insulation.<br><br>
The clause gives the Secretary of State compulsory power to enter. I understand the logic for local authorities having such power, but I am not sure in what circumstances the Secretary of State will need to jump on his bike, pedal down to 26 Acacia avenue and insist on entry. Will the Minister explain why the Secretary of State wants this power?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The temptations are almost too great, but I shall resist them.<br><br>
I do not like powers to enter. Every time I see them in a Bill I ask why they are needed. Here, if there is an inquiry into a compulsory purchase order, the inspector must be able to enter a house to ascertain whether the allegations made or the arguments advanced are correct. In some circumstances people would refuse the inspector entry unless the Secretary of State had power to insist.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Hammersmith has noticed that throughout the Bill we are giving longer notice. I have always considered that 24 hours is far too short. In future the period of notice will be seven days. I shall not go into the reasons why that is more sensible except to say that people should have notice if their privacy is to be invaded. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment in the light of that explanation.</span></p>

DIRECTIONS AND GUIDANCE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 628, in page 81, line 12, leave out from 'areas' to end of line 14.<br><br>
Clause 88 is short, but designed to allow anything to happen at any time. Why does the Secretary of State need different directions for different local authorities? How will the directions work if they are to be varied from one local authority to another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason is the enormous variation between local authorities, a point made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor). Each local authority faces different problems. The same direction would not be appropriate for a major scheme in, for example, Oldham and for one in the home counties. There is a fundamental difference which should be recognised and admitted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to schemes. Surely the clause would cover different cases without it being necessary to have different directions for different local authorities. The power is there to deal with any variation in schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are real differences in the way in which local authorities make housing arrangements. I was a little sharp with the hon. Gentleman on the subject of Norfolk and Suffolk, Coastal. They have completely different local authorities meeting different needs. It would be odd if the Secretary of State's directions had to be the same for each local authority, even those within the different classes.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has almost given us a working example. I cannot help thinking that he deliberately misunderstood what I said about East Anglia. I said that I visited Norwich but I was also talking about housing problems in East Anglia. The clause gives the power to deal with different areas without needing to vary the directions for local authorities. I suspect that at root the Minister wants a wider power to alter what local authorities can do. We are slightly suspicious of his intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gummer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman should perpetuate the concept of Norwich imperialism. It is a delicate matter locally.</span></p>
