	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had a healthy and non-controversial debate on Tuesday on subjects such as bingo duty, historic houses and correspondence course training, we can approach friendly societies in the same bi-partisan way. This issue does not divide the parties and we have not tabled the new clauses in a controversial or antagonistic way. Indeed, responding to an Adjournment debate initiated by his hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Combs), the Economic Secretary to the Treasury concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>'I know that there is much sympathy for the friendly society movement and a desire to see it continue to prosper and perform its essential role in encouraging savings and mutual self help.'—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 April 1989; Vol 150, c, 174.]</p></blockquote>
That sentiment will be echoed on both sides of the Committee. There is wide support in the House for the work of friendly societies, partly because they do valuable work in encouraging saving and prudent provision, partly because that encouragement of saving inevitably has a small but significant counter-inflationary effect on the local economy, partly because they are based upon the sound mutual principle of collective self-help, but principally because they have always performed a crucial role in relation to the small saver. Those on low incomes who none the less wish to make provision for their retirement or death can do so on a small-scale basis with a friendly society. Friendly societies have concentrated on what might be described as the lower end of the savings market. They are an important force in the savings community as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am indebted to the Friendly Societies Liaison Committee for its assistance in drawing up the new clauses and in preparing these brief remarks, to the Ancient Order of Foresters and to my noble Friend Lord Graham who takes a particular interest in these matters. It is not overstating the case to say that large sectors of the friendly society movement are in a state of crisis today. One of the two examples that come immediately to mind is the Fleet friendly society, which was set up eight years ago and was found to be actuarially insolvent two days before the 1988 accounts went to the printers. It has fortunately since been established that its benefit funds can more than cover the shortfall anticipated by the actuaries,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
but its independence as a friendly society is still in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, there have been reports of the work of the Tunbridge Wells equitable society in helping the Time Assurance Society of Oldham with its problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A report in 	<i>The Guardian</i> of a week ago said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tussle over Time Assurance will further underscore severe pressures placed on friendly societies by restrictive financial regulations, which may push more of them into alliances or force demutualisations."</p></blockquote>
Many friendly societies now facing financial difficulties would prefer not to choose the demutualisation route, because they fear that they would lose their essential character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties of Time Assurance and Fleet exemplify some of the problems of the friendly society movement. Other financial institutions have recently had restrictions substantially loosened, and can compete, often advantageously, against the friendly societies, which are still subject to an ancient legislative framework largely dating from 1879. Little has been done to change that framework since then. In a world of intense competition, the friendly societies lose out because they cannot offer the services and options that other financial institutions can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The costs of such services have risen greatly because of the increase in demand. The European Community life directive requires that societies be valued annually. Most societies used to be valued every three or every five years. That was satisfactory because the policies issued were small, and relatively few sales were made. Many funds such as the Holloway sickness fund which were not subject to valuation before are now valued annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fees incurred because of the requirements have risen dramatically and often exceed £1 per policy per annum. Friendly society policies are small and require the collection of 12 premiums per year and their allocation to a contract, the yearly issue of benefit statements, other communications from the society, valuation and administrative work, auditing and the posting of valuation information in newspapers, all of which place administrative costs on the societies' work. Those costs have all risen substantially in the past five years, especially compared with the costs of other financial institutions which may not be in the same position when marketing small-scale policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many friendly societies are facing difficulties as a result of competition from groups in the financial community which are not subject to such strict legislative regulation and to increased administrative costs resulting from the Financial Services Act 1986 and the European life directive. A new legislative framework is the ideal solution to such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wyre Forest put his finger on the nub of the issue in the Adjournment debate of 4 April, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By widening the scope of services, they ought to be able to provide, through the friendly society movement, effective competition or other financial institutions and more effective and efficient services for their members. They ought to be able to
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
increase their access to markets which at present are dominated by insurance companies and pension funds, particularly by those who corner the market by means of tied intermediaries."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 April 1989; Vol. 150, c. 169]</p></blockquote>
Widening the scope of services is the key to the long-term future of friendly societies. That requires a new legislative framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary has established a review of friendly societies' structures. It is under way, but how long will it take? There is an urgent need for legislation to assist friendly societies in the crises that they face. I accept that the Government must consider carefully, publish proposals and allow a period for wide consultation, but I hope that they will introduce legislation in the year after the next parliamentary session, if not next year. The Opposition will want to scrutinise the Government's proposals carefully, but we shall co-operate to ensure that the friendly societies' regime can be relaxed and that they can provide a wider range of services. I hope that the Government will give us some idea of the timescale of their proposals—when will their review be completed, and when will they introduce legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses are proposed as an interim measure to fend off the crisis facing the societies between now and the period when primary legislation can proceed. The new clauses seek to increase the tax-exempt limit available to investors in friendly societies from £100 to £200 per year. New clause 50 seeks to establish that new limit; new clause 51 goes on to propose an index linking for subsequent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of our proposals to the Exchequer would be minimal. The additional £100 made available to the investor by extending the tax-exempt limit could be invested to yield £12 to £15 per annum. The tax take, disregarding office expenses, would be £3 to £5 per investor per annum, assuming that it was all income. Therefore, the average cost of raising the tax-exempt limit by £100, as proposed under this new clause, would be £4 per person per annum. That is a relatively small price for the Exchequer to pay for a considerable freeing-up of the ability of friendly societies to compete with other financial institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary has recognised the principle of the tax exempt limit. In a letter to the Friendly Societies Liaison Committee on 26 May, he referred to existing tax relief
	<br><blockquote><p>"as an encouragement to societies to assist the less wealthy in making a modest provision for their old age and against their eventual death".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that the Government recognise that
	<br><blockquote><p>"such small policies (or contracts) are relatively more expensive to set up and administer than larger ones."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the point that we believe justifies the extension of the tax-exempt limit to £300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same letter, the Economic Secretary introduced a caveat. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not realistic to expect the Government to maintain declining institutions at the expense of the taxpayer in the hope that things may get better: that is not the purpose of tax reliefs."</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree. The way to help friendly societies effectively to compete in the market place is primarily
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
by legislative change. The proposal for an increase in the tax-exempt limit is a proposal to deal with the acute interim problems faced by a number of friendly societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When seeking the increase from £100 to £200 we should compare the relatively favourable treatment that is available to other forms of saving, life assurance and financial services. We must remember that the Finance Bill has increased the personal equity plan fund limit from £2,400 to £4,800, that tax concessions are available to occupational pension schemes and to certain national savings deposits, and that tax-free benefits are available in certain circumstances from investments in gilts. All those are competing forms of saving which the tax system recognises and against which the friendly societies have to compete. They are all items referred to by the hon. Member for Wyre Forest in the debate of 4 April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Friendly societies need assistance, and the cost to the Exchequer would be minimal. The worth of the market sector that the friendly societies seek to cater for is acknowledged, and the competing forms of saving are in some cases eligible for considerably greater amounts of tax relief than the friendly societies can take up with their present tax-exempt limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current tax-exempt limit of £100 was established in 1987. It effectively dates back to 1984, when the Government first proposed the figure. It should have been inflation-indexed since then, but it has not been. In terms of the equivalent sum assured, the figure of £200 would take us back to 1984. The increase that we are asking from the Government is not great.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that prices have doubled since 1984?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am in no way saying that, although prices have increased since 1984. The ability of the commercial sector of life insurance to offer benefits to those wishing to take up its policies has increased at a rate considerably greater than the rate of inflation. We should be more generous to the friendly societies than simply using the retail price index as the yardstick by which to increase their tax exempt limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the two new clauses we are offering two options to the Government: a straight increase in the limit, or a straight increase in the limit with subsequent indexation. We recognise the worth of what the friendly societies have to offer, we recognise the difficulties that many of them face and we suspect that it will be at least a year and a half—we hope that it will be no longer—before the Government come forward with legislative proposals to increase the scope of friendly society activity. We hope that the Government will recognise that something needs to be done to alleviate the difficulties facing the friendly societies. The increase in the tax exempt limit seems to be a simple and relatively cost-effective way of doing that without destroying the Government's overall approach to financial services and the benefits that individuals can derive from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I hear from the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), the more I warm to some of his arguments. I hope that that will not encourage him to speak for too much longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to discuss whether the new clause is the correct way of dealing with the problem. I am perfectly content to accept advice that this is not the correct way of dealing with it. However, there is a problem which must be tackled. During the five or six years I have been attending Committees considering Finance Bills, there have been many debates about friendly societies. I have left all of them with a sense of unease about whether we were doing right. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will examine this issue again and bring forward proposals that will be helpful to an institution that is still valuable. It may not be as important for our national life as it once was, but it is still valuable and there is no particular reason why legislative activity should make friendly societies disappear entirely from the social and economic fabric of our society. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will help as soon as they can, although possibly not this year because of the review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All sides of the Committee are in favour of these societies, perhaps for the idea of individual self-help or for reasons of collective provision. We have a benign attitude toward this organisation, but as sure as eggs is eggs, whenever all sides of the House have a benign attitude to something, it is likely to be dying. That is what is happening now. Everybody is in favour of friendly societies, but those of us who are responsible for the legislative framework within which they operate are the cause of their being throttled. The Economic Secretary must recognise that over many years Governments, including Labour Governments, have forced friendly societies to operate in a framework that was devised for the 19th century. The modernisation in 1974 did not remove the essentially restrictive nature of the role that was thrust on friendly societies in the 19th century. They are forbidden to be involved with unit trusts or PEPs. The minor concession that they enjoy is the freedom from tax on premiums of up to £100 a year. That is simply inadequate. We must examine the financial framework within which they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general revival of the co-operative spirit makes that especially important. Co-operatives are increasingly popular, be they producer co-operatives or co-operatives such as those in the housing association movement. We should seek to avoid the humane destruction of friendly societies, which will happen if we do not alter the legislative framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £100 limit is absurd. Even Labour Members can make provisions for their future that go way beyond a premium of £100 a year. There is no doubt that friendly societies retain a contact with the parts of society that other forms of insurance cannot reach. They have a credibility and an historical link with some sections of the community. But the £100 limit says to people, "Don't bother with us. We're not of the present century, we're of the past". There is no realism about that £100 limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
We should also encourage friendly societies because they act in ways that are not shared by major insurance or assurance companies. Some friendly societies, for example, run old people's homes, and I have heard it said that a friendly society will go the extra yard to help people in distress. They do not have the impersonality that is typical of a large organisation. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) correctly observed that the £100 tax-free limit is not really a perk, because it goes to people who are in much more difficult circumstances than those who benefit from other tax-free allowances, such as the business expansion schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury noted the considerable extra burdens that the Financial Services Act 1986 and the EC directive placed on friendly societies. Large organisations can easily shrug off such burdens, which in that case were justified, but the smaller friendly societies cannot. We must realise that we shall be responsible for the death of those societies if we continue to do nothing. It is not enough for the Economic Secretary to say that there is a review. A review has to come to an end and friendly societies must be assured that their needs will be responded to quickly. If we cannot have that review and its pronouncement now, the new clauses tabled by my hon. Friend are appropriate short-term reliefs that the Committee should consider seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Peter Lilley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said about this being a bi-partisan issue and hon. Members of all parties having a great deal of support and sympathy for friendly societies. I welcome their work and wish them to continue to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) for initiating an Adjournment debate, which provided the first opportunity for us on the Floor of the House, other than in a Finance Bill, to discuss friendly societies. That enabled the issues to be aired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury in the new clause, and on points made by other hon. Members. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) felt that the £100 tax allowance was too low for Labour Members. Although the friendly societies movement has 3.5 million members, most earn considerably less than any hon. Member. It is always possible to form a friendly society specifically for members of the Labour party, although that may be the only time when the brothers' party has the characteristic of friendliness among its members rather than to others.

The specific proposal is that the £100 tax-exempt limit should be doubled. I do not recommend that proposal to my hon. Friends, sympathetic though I am, and they are, to friendly societies, for three reasons. First, when the £100 limit was introduced,
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
it represented a considerable improvement on the situation that had existed since 1984. It was welcomed by the friendly societies. I have a letter from the chairman of the friendly societies to my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Stewart). It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you for your letter of 17th March. I am delighted by the good news it contained, and am sure the changes proposed by the Chancellor will be welcomed warmly by small friendly societies, who believed that the 1984 measures left them with no viable future. I am most grateful for your initiative in getting up the Joint Study Group, and for agreeing to this modification of the tax regime, which is so valuable to many of our member societies."</p></blockquote>
So, only two years ago, that was welcomed as a valuable and signficant change. There may be an argument for uprating the limit in line with inflation, which is only 12 per cent. over that period and far less than the proposed doubling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the essential purpose of the relief, as I argued in the letter to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred, is to encourage societies to assist the less wealthy in making a modest provision for their old age and against their death and to recognise that such small policies or contracts are relatively more expensive to set up and administer than larger ones. The relief is not to subsidise societies in general during a difficult period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, only a minority of business carried out by societies would benefit form the tax change. Most business is taxable business, not all business would be helped and the benefit would be unevenly spread. It would help some societies more than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is wrong to make a permanent change in the tax system to overcome an essentially transitional problem, as presented by the societies themselves and by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and others who have spoken. Their problem is how to continue operating within the present legal framework when it is in their view—and the Government sympathises with them—unsatisfactory. We set up a review to reconsider it. Essentially, friendly societies are constrained by the original Act and are allowed to carry out only the business listed there. Because they do not have a corporate structure, they are not allowed to have subsidiaries through which they could operate other businesses. Those are two central problems that the review that I have set up seeks to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem encountered by the societies is a much longer secular change that has been going on since the beginning of the century and the establishment of the welfare state initially in 1906, although friendly societies had a role within the original framework, and more intensively since 1945 when they have had less of a role. That has inevitably meant that they want to change and to cease to have quite such a central role as they did in the past. They cannot change their manner of operation until we have changed the legal framework. However, a permanent fiscal change should not be made to deal with a short-term transitional problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We appreciate that there is considerable demand from the societies to bring forward legislation as soon as the review is satisfactorily completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to push the Economic Secretary a little bit further. It is difficult to imagine that the review is so complex that he cannot give an undertaking that it will be completed within the next financial year. Will the review be published in the form of a consultation paper so that people can respond to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly my intention to publish proposals and consult upon them when the review is completed, but I cannot give a specific date when it will be possible to publish such proposals. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury mentioned specific societies that have difficulties. Obviously, it would be wrong for me to comment on the position of individual societies, but I should mention that neither of those that he mentioned is of the traditional generic type of society about which most concern is expressed in the House and in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we recognise that a change is needed to help these societies, we believe that change is essentially legislative rather than fiscal. I therefore hope that the Committee will not feel it appropriate to make the fiscal change recommended in the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed by the Economic Secretary's response to the two new clauses. It is not sensible to make permanent changes in the tax system to overcome transitional changes that may be faced by societies. However, we must acknowledge the increasing anxiety in the friendly societies movement, because they can see no end to their difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government said that the review would be completed within the next eight to 12 months, that they would publish a White Paper at that stage, that they would then have a period of consultation and that their aim—legislative slots permitting—was to introduce a Bill for consideration in the parly year 1990–91, I suspect that the friendly societies would be reasonably happy. They would say, "We are having difficulties at the moment, but we can see an end in sight. As things will change, we shall batten down the hatches and make do as we can in the interim." Unfortunately, however, the Government are not saying that. Instead, they are saying that there is a review, but that they can give no assurances about
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
the time scale. When my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) challenged the Economic Secretary to say that the review would be completed and published some time in the next financial year, the Economic Secretary could not even do that. So we can appreciate the friendly societies' anxiety in the light of the uncertainty about the time scale, involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also ignoring the two crucial points about the proposed changes in the new clauses. First, considerable additional administrative costs have been placed on friendly societies in the past two years as a result of the European directive and the Financial Services Act 1986. The societies' administrative costs and difficulties have increased by a quantum leap. That should be taken into account when comparing what should be the case now with what it was in 1984 and in 1987 when the £100 limit was set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at the same time as the friendly societies face those difficulties, other financial institutions have been freed up and extremely generous fiscal provision has been made, especially, as we know from this year's Budget proposals, the increase in the limit on personal equity plans. So while the competition has been given generous fiscal and legislative treatment—the most obvious institution to have been freed up is the building society—the friendly societies have no definite prospect of when the legislative framework will be relaxed and no acknowledgement within the tax-exempt limit of the additional administration difficulties that they face day by day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary's response was disappointing. I hope that over the next few weeks and months the Government will give us an idea of the time scale for legislative change. I agree with the Economic Secretary that in the long run, legislative change is the route to follow. As I said earlier the Opposition will be happy to co-operate in making it as easy as possible for the Government to identify a slot in which to introduce legislation on the issue. While we may differ from the Government on some of the detail of that legislation, I suspect that on the broad principle, we shall be on all fours with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that we fear for the future of the friendly societies in the current state of uncertainty and difficulty and without a commitment from the Government on time scale, but it is important to ensure that a bi-partisan approach is adopted. Therefore, we do not wish to press the new clause to a Division. We do not wish to proceed by confrontation on the issue, but we are worried about it and hope that discussions will continue with the Government about the future of the friendly societies movement, which all members of the Committee support. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 52 is a wide clause, which seeks to lower the rate of VAT from 15 per cent. to 12 per cent. It is wide because the Ways and Means resolutions are drawn so tightly that it would be difficult for any member of the Committee except Ministers to table acceptable amendments that were within those resolutions. In practice, the only way to get round the problem is to table a new blanket clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why Ways and Means resolutions are drawn tightly. The Committee would not want to consider 50 or 60 amendments about changing the VAT rate on different items. We should get fed up with that, because different hon. Members would receive different representations and feel impelled to raise them via an appropriate amendment. Although I am upset that the Ways and Means resolutions are drawn tightly, I recognise the need for that. Perhaps the Government will draw them slightly more loosely next year to allow a little more flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of VAT that a few items attract should be carefully considered by the Government. I have received many representations about the VAT on sanitary towels for women. That is an old chestnut that has been considered before. The Treasury has received many representations about it. I warned the Economic Secretary about the items that I would mention because it would not be fair to spring items on him. However good his civil servants are, they may not have all the relevant documents. The Economic Secretary indicates that it is all in his head. If that is so, I may be tempted to spring a few surprises on him next time, but no doubt he goes to sleep and wakes up thinking of VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are questions about whether VAT should be imposed on sanitary towels for women. Some people argue that if the Government gave way on this issue, demands would be made to draw zero-rating on other sanitary items such as shavers for men and toilet paper. Nevertheless, could not a distinction be drawn between sanitary towels and other hygienic items on the basis that only women have to pay for them and as such the tax is unfair and discriminatory? I hope that even if the Economic Secretary cannot do anything about the matter, he will at least agree with me that it is unfair and discriminatory that approximately half the population is necessarily subject to a VAT charge to which the other half is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government wish to keep VAT at 15 per cent. and keep tax as broad as possible. They do not want to make exceptions because if they did there would be representations to make the excepted area a little wider next year. However, there is a case for making an exception on the grounds that the charge is unfair and discriminatory to one half of the population. If the Economic Secretary cannot do anything immediately, will he at least undertake to discuss the matter with his colleagues in Europe to see whether some agreement can be reached?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
I have also received representations on motorcycle helmets, as opposed to bicycle helmets, and restraining seatbelts for children and adults in cars. On helmets for bicycles, group 17 of schedule 5 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983 has been amended by the Bill, but in such a way that it was impossible to tag on any other amendment to it. Item 3 in group 17 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Protective helmets for wear by a person driving or riding a motor bicycle."</p></blockquote>
Why is the word "motor" used? Should we not perhaps refer to protective helmets for wear by a person driving or riding a bicycle, and widen the provision a little?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will agree that riding a bicycle, especially in a place like London, can be dangerous. I do not know the statistics, but I suspect that they would show that whether one drives a motor bicycle at 30 mph or rides an ordinary bicycle at 15 mph, the chances of head injury are the same. Although the word "motor" has been used in group 17 for many years, I wonder whether some thought could be given to widening the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that Members of the Committee may easily grasp my argument, I shall quote item 1 of group 17, which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Articles designed as clothing or footwear for young children and not suitable for older persons."</p></blockquote>
It is at least arguable that helmets are clothing. A bicycle helmet could be used by a child or an adult. This is a difficult argument, and the Economic Secretary might say that if a manufacturer could demonstrate that a particular helmet was specially made for a child, he might allow VAT to be zero-rated. However, although other helmets may be used by child cyclists, if they can to be used by adult cyclists—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If helmets were usable by children, and helmets would be regarded as clothing, they would fall under item 1 of group 17 and would be zero-rated. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
Economic Secretary will probably argue that unless the helmets for bicycle use were made specially for children and could not be used by adults, they could possibly be zero-rated. Many helmets could be used by small adults or by large fat children. There are all types of people of all sorts of physical shapes. I suspect that the Government will argue that unless helmets are made specifically for children under item 1, they would have to carry VAT. That is partly why we tabled the new clause. It would be helpful if the Government could give some thought to that. Everybody is interested in encouraging bicyclists, and especially children, to wear helmets for their own safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about seat belts. When the sixth VAT directive was signed, seat belts for children were hardly thought of. It is arguable that seat belts are clothing in the same way as other safety aids, such as helmets, are clothing. If they are, and they are fitted to the back of a car, they should attract zero-rated VAT. We tabled the new clause as a token move, so that at least if these items could not be zero-rated, we could perhaps lower the rate of VAT on them from 15 per cent. to 12 per cent. If that were done, there would be hurrahs up and down the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall follow the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) in interpreting the new clause to allow discussion of specific items rather than of the general question of whether VAT should be reduced. Suffice it to say that the Government's priority in reducing taxation is to reduce income tax to 20p in the pound when it is prudent to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham asked whether we could rephrase the resolutions more loosely. That is desirable in principle, but impossible in practice. It is like chastity; once one has started on the slippery road, there cannot be a little unchastity without it leading to all types of problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once one starts one cannot stop?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wrexham was asking us to be loose and to weaken our resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of altering the VAT system to relieve those items from taxation that are used only by certain groups and not by others. I cannot recommend the Committee to accept that strange notion. It is surely far fairer to work on the principle that VAT is a broadly based tax, applying to everything except for a few essentials that are traditionally zero-rated. Under European law, we do not have the power to create new zero rates, even if we want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham proposed a tax relief on sanitary towels because they are used exclusively by women. That would open immediate demands for similar reliefs by other groups for products that are used exclusively, or primarily, by them. Those groups need not be based on sex, but on other characteristics. There would be no natural end to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
I am saddened that the Labour party retains that attachment to equality. I thought that it had abandoned that during our debate on bingo duties, when the Committee was united in the principle that it was desirable to pool money and redistribute it unequally and that the size of the inequality should be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second item raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham related to helmets, bicycle helmets and headgear for big-headed children. There is a general rule that articles designed as clothing or footwear for young children, which are not suitable for older persons, are zero-rated. For ordinary clothing, that is determined by a size criterion. That is difficult to establish for headgear because heads change little in size from childhood to adulthood. A big-headed child has a bigger head than a small-headed adult. I speak as one who started off as a big-headed child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to have zero-rating for headgear that is designed primarily for young children and is not suitable for older persons. I am told that that is achieved often by printing Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse on the headgear, which renders it not suitable for older persons—at least for those not of a frivolous disposition. In practice, such headgear is designed for children and benefits from being zero-rated. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard) for pursuing, in the interests of her constituents who produce such headgear, that particular issue to a successful resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham also mentioned seat belts for children—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but I have waited anxiously for this part of the Economic Secretary's speech. I am relieved that he understood that the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) referred to seat belts. At the beginning of the Economic Secretary's speech, I feared that he had perhaps misunderstood and thought that the hon. Gentleman was talking about chastity belts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you, Mr. Crowther, are putting ideas into the hon. Gentleman's head that there will be a resolution along those lines next year, if we loosen our resolution now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) introduced relief for motorcyclists' helmets in his first Budget in 1974, but he did not see fit to extend the concession to safety items generally, such as car seat belts or children's safety seats. The opportunity existed before the 1975 passage of the sixth VAT directive, which prohibited us from subsequently introducing any new zero rates. We cannot do so now because of the general ban on new zerzo rates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of my argument is that at the time children's seat belts were hardly thought of. If there is a desire to zero-rate those items—regulations concerning children's seat belts are to come before the House—perhaps the Economic Secretary could take up the matter with other Ministers in the Common Market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that motor cars and children had been invented in 1975 and that the issue was raised in Parliament at that time. Seat belts certainly existed then, but we did not take up the option. Regardless of what has transpired, I do not know whether we could persuade our Common Market partners to enable us to introduce a new zero rate when they are either not interested in the issue or are opposed to our having zero rates. We have just persuaded the Commissioner, Madame Scrivener, to take a more relaxed and pragmatic attitude to our existing zero rates, but I cannot imagine that she or the Commission would be willing to enable us to multiply our zero rates. I do not think that it would be worth attempting to persuade them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to intervene briefly on what may happen on VAT regulations in the Community. The Minister must be aware that, with the coming of the new Commission, there has been a considerable change in its attitude to VAT proposals that were constructed with the move to the single market. The Minister may also be aware that, in the European Parliament's consideration of Lord Cockfield's original proposals, the European Parliament proposed that there should be a new VAT band of from 0 to 6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the change on the VAT scene has not been settled, it seems that it would be well worth the Government's while to consider the proposals put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek). In the present state of flux over VAT—we realise that it may be a year or two before proposals are finalised; indeed, there may not be a final proposal by 1992—the Government must surely agree that there will be changes in the VAT regime with the onset of the internal market. In that context, it may be possible for sanitary towels, children's seat belts and children's safety seats in cars to be zero-rated. What would be the loss of VAT to the Revenue if those items, which are currently subject to VAT, were zero-rated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a figure because manufacturers and distributors are not required to distinguish these items for fiscal or other purposes. However, it is not primarily the revenue on those items that concerns us, but the fact that once we establish the principle inherent in this argument, we would rapidly narrow the base of taxation, as almost every item would be found to be used predominantly by one group rather than another, and so an excuse for reducing its taxation would be found by those who used it more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) has made a valuable point. There may be changes to VAT rates as a result of Madame Scrivener's proposals. There is more chance of that happening with VAT than with duties. I hope that the Government will bear in mind my comments and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend. It is discriminatory and unfair to have VAT on sanitary towels. Such items could be zero-rated or VAT could be charged at a lower rate, because they represent a social need and are of direct

It is with great pleasure that I move my first new clause in my first Finance Bill Committee. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] I should like to thank my hon. Friends on the front Bench and the Clerk for their helpfulness to me in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 53 deals with consumer credit and, in particular, with the irresponsible attitude of many of the companies offering consumer credit and with some of the human misery caused thereby. Before getting on to the specifics of the new clause, I should like to put it in its economic context because only then can it be understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consumer credit is so important because we are living through the Lawson boom—the South Sea
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
Bubble of the 20th century. Much of that boom is fuelled by consumer demand and much of that consumer demand is fuelled by credit. I hope to make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to our so-called economic boom and the huge balance of payments deficit that is caused by surging domestic and consumer demand, I can do no better than to quote from the report on the 1989 Budget by the Treasury and Civil Service committee, on which I served:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can think of no modern-day example of a major industrial nation—even one with substantial overseas assets—which has been able to run such a large deficit without encountering currency difficulties."</p></blockquote>
The report says of consumer credit:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The worrying pattern of the 1980s have seen a marked deterioration in the visible balance of trade, courtesy of the swing from surplus into deficit in manufactured goods. The most pronounced weakness has been in finished consumer products."</p></blockquote>
In other words, a dangerous and tenuous boom, fuelled by domestic and consumer demand, is by and large being met by overseas products to the detriment of our manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that the problem with the consumer credit industry has got out of hand. We in Britain are little more than credit card addicts. Almost 30 million credit cards are in circulation—10 times more than in Germany or Italy. We spent £20.3 billion on our credit cards last year alone. There is a credit card explosion—a £21 billion plastic craving. The worst aspect of this explosion is the store card. Store cards can be acquired from stores such as the House of Fraser, and from shoe and dress shops. Stores are especially irresponsible because they give out cards to anyone without making sufficient checks. To cover the inevitable number of bad debts, those cards have astronomic interest rates of about 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some of examples of the problems that arise from the irresponsible dishing out of those store credit cards. A young woman who earned less than £100 a week was able to run up debts of £13,000 with 23 credit cards with which she was issued by high street stores. A 17-year-old fell to his death while breaking into a shop to get money to pay off a £5,000 debt he had run up with store credit cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A cashier was sent to prison for nine months after stealing from his bank to pay off credit card debts of £8,000. A shop assistant in my constituency earning £80 a week ran up debts of £25,000. Young people, often in their first jobs, can run up such debts with store credit cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Consumers Association did a check on store credit cards. It sent out one of its workers, who managed to collect store cards in a high street which enabled her to obtain £1,500 worth of credit. If she spent up to the limit of those cards and made the minimum payment each month, it would have taken her seven years to pay off her debts and she would have paid £1,400 interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition consider that this is scandalous. Something should be done to make stores behave more responsibly when giving out cards. The new
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
clause makes no provision for any tax penalty for stores handing out cards, but it asks for information. The first step in dealing with this serious problem would be the provision of information on the bad debts that had been run up and information on the extent to which the credit card companies make sufficient checks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of a consumer boom largely fed by credit, an essentially materialistic set of values in society has grown up. When I was a child we were told to save for what we wanted; now young people get into debt for what they want. That sort of materialism and rabid consumerism is the watchword of Thatcherism, despite the Prime Minister's recent attempt to get religion. If there are hallmarks of the Thatcher decade, they are materialism, consumerism and acquisition. The irresponsible attitude of credit card companies encourages many young people to get into debt. The least the card companies can do is to document their level of bad debt and to check whether people can afford to pay. The new clause is the first step towards achieving that. It flags up the problem of surging consumer demand and irresponsible credit card companies, and we hope that it will make the Government look seriously at that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The credit expansion has been beneficial to a wide range of people who would not have had access to the degree of flexibility given by credit cards. The Labour party's regular attack on credit cards is misguided. The total outstanding credit from credit cards, including hire purchase, is approximately 5 per cent. of total outstanding credit at any time. The Labour party is aiming at the wrong target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
the major boosts to consumer spending has been the leakage out of the mortgage market. It has not been due to the credit card expansion to which the new clause relates. The problem has been that something like half of the new money that has gone into mortgages has been leaking out into consumer spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual my hon. Friend makes an extremely good point, for which I am grateful. However, my argument remains that if credit controls are introduced in order to prevent the leakage that occurs under mortgage expansion they would hit first-time mortgages hardest. Conservative Members would not want that. It is a form of discrimination that woud be extremely unpopular. Finally, no form of credit controls in this modern, deregulated economy are possible without exchange controls. I am sure that no Opposition Member would urge the introduction of exchange controls now that there is a new, modern, pro-European Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) on moving the new clause so ably and effectively. She spoke movingly of the difficulties facing innocent people who are beguiled into over-indebtedness by the ease and aggression with which credit is thrust upon them. That is precisely the problem that the new clause seeks to resolve. It is not about restricting credit. It is not about attacking the availability of credit cards or store house credit. It concerns the information that is available to the person taking up credit and the care with which the lender assesses the risk of the loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the principal problem lies. There is nothing wrong with credit in itself. When the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) says that the Labour party is attacking credit cards he could not be further from the truth. We do not attack credit per se. We are looking carefully at the way in which it is sold to customers. The problem lies in the injudicious availability of credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fulham made an interesting point about the leakage out of mortgage lending. That is one of the principal problems of credit availability and consumer spending that we have faced in this country over the past few years. The next time the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us that we need not worry about the credit figures because 80 per cent. of them are made up of mortgage lending, I hope that the hon. Member for Fulham will make his point again to his right hon. Friend. To say that credit does not matter because it is mortgage lending totally ignores the point that the hon. Gentleman was making. A a large amount of the lending which ostensibly goes to house purchase finds its way into the retail consumer spending market in this country because of the leakage problem which he identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman recall that the original distinction between tax-protected mortgage lending and lending
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
for other kinds of consumer spending had its origin under a Labour Government? The hon. Gentleman draws attention to that distinction as if it were in some way the Government's fault.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that the distinction is the Government's fault. The distinction is a sensible piece of economic analysis. The problem is that a lot of financial activity in the mortgage lending sector is not necessarily directly linked to house purchase. That is the difficulty that the Chancellor continually ignores and which has helped to fuel some of the consumer growth in this country over the past two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman underestimates the thrust of Government policy over the past few years. It has consistently restricted the availability of mortgage interest relief to people who are using their mortgage to buy their first house and to buy their principle residence rather than to those who want to build extensions or to remortgage, for whom mortgage interest relief is no longer allowable. The hon. Gentleman will recall that from last year's Finance Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is partly right. The changes which the Government have brought in have restricted mortgage interest relief on home improvements and on the sharing of purchase. Mortgage interest relief is still available for purchases other than first purchases and it is also still available, somewhat unbelievably, at higher rates of income tax. I suspect, Mr. Crowther—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am being ever so relaxed on this last sitting but the discussion on mortgage interest relief has gone far enough now. As far as I can see, there is nothing about it in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspected, Mr. Crowther, that you were about to reprimand me gently but I was sorely tempted by the hon. Member for Fulham, who initially made an important point but did not demonstrate the same acuteness of economic perception in his second intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of consumer credit is undoubtedly growing. Leaving aside mortgage lending for home purchase, according to the most recent figures for consumer credit in the monetary sector which includes credit cards, new lending was £2.9 billion in 1985. In 1988 it was £5.6 billion. In three years the amount of new consumer credit lending doubled. That is the problem which my hon. Friend's new clause seeks to resolve. The Government's answer, which is simply to keep putting up interest rates to deter people from taking up credit, is not working. It is not having the impact on consumer credit that the Chancellor hoped for when he began ratcheting up interest rates. The problem with using interest rates as the weapon for controlling credit is that it does not necessarily deter people from taking up credit opportunities, nor does it necessarily encourage people who have already taken out credit to come out of indebtedness. The new clause would ensure that credit was sold to individuals with care and with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
a proper assessment of the risks so that if interest rates were raised as they have been over the past nine or 12 months, the resulting indebtedness would not unduly and impossibly penalise those who had taken out the credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warmly commend my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington for having so ably put the new clause to the Committee. In the light of the end-of-term spirit that infects us, I hope that the Financial Secretary will be not only gallant but sensible in his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Norman Lamont)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All my hon. Friends showed their warm welcome for the contribution made by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). We enjoyed her previous contribution, in which she described restrictive practices in the television industry, and we enjoyed her speech on this subject, although she did not carry all my hon. Friends along with her in the logic of her argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Lady intended her new clause to be directed at what she sees to be the social problems of credit and people being over-borrowed, although she used the opportunity to make some comments about general economic policy. She referred to the growth over the past few years as being based simply on consumer demand. We often hear that charge from the Labour party. I always think that it is a very strange charge, because I am not sure what growth can be based on if it is not based on consumer demand. Ultimately, what is the point of economic activity? It is to satisfy consumers. That is the whole purpose of the economy. Sometimes, when one listens to the Labour party, one thinks that the economy can be run in such a way that there are simply machine tooks making machine tools for machine tools with no consumer in any way involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was, I think, directing her remarks largely at the social consequences of borrowing, but she also seemed to think that the new clause would do something to stop the expansion of credit. She seemed at times to be arguing that we needed some form of credit control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not seeking to restrict the expansion of credit; I was seeking merely to flag up the importance of a more responsible attitude on the part of the people who give out credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for making that clear, and I hope that that is a firm commitment from the Labour party that it is wholly opposed to credit controls in all circumstances. At times, remarks by Labour Front-Bench spokesmen have suggested that they thought that controls could work. All the evidence of the past and in the rest of Europe is overwhelmingly against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) was right to stress the positive side of the growth of credit in recent years and what that means for many ordinary people, in increasing the choice and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
opportunities that are available to them. That is one of the arguments against credit controls, because they would restrict the availability of credit to the better off, the better advised and the more sophisticated. There is a good side to the growth in credit that we have seen in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her new clause, the hon. Lady is seeking to impose on credit organisations an obligation to provide the Inland Revenue with information about the circumstances in which they have incurred bad debts by providing credit to people to whom, in the words of the new clause, it
	<br><blockquote><p>"ought not reasonably to have been provided".</p></blockquote>
Of course, I understand that the hon. Lady wishes to discourage credit organisations from giving credit in such circumstances, but it would be entirely inappropriate to involve the Revenue as suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credit institutions do not seek bad debts; a bad debt is a loss. It is always in the interest of lenders to avoid bad debts. Of course, they attempt to do that by making checks on applications for loans; they often use information collected by credit reference agencies. That is why the proportion of loans that fall into arrears is surprisingly small. In 1988, it was about 5 per cent. of consumer lending—the lowest for 10 years—and much lower on some mortgages. The most important cause of bad debt is unforeseen personal circumstances, such as redundancy, illness or divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is an important practical point. It is not clear what the hon. Lady thinks that the Inland Revenue could do with the information that the new clause would give it. Does she seriously suggest that tax inspectors should, in deciding whether to issue a notice, be expected to take a view on whether a credit organisation is claiming relief for debts that have gone bad because the debtor was someone to whom credit ought not "reasonably" to have been given? What is the Revenue supposed to do with the information when it has it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has a point, but it should not be directed at the Revenue. If she feels that the supervision of credit institutions is not adequate, she should table amendments to the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which imposes extensive protection for borrowers. It contains measures relating to advertisements, cooling-off periods, allowing the courts to reopen agreements that are considered unfair, and requiring lenders to set out the terms of an agreement. The Government have reviewed several areas covered by the Consumer Credit Act and in their White Paper "Releasing Enterprise", published last year, listed areas where they seek to make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to underline a point that has been made in interventions by my hon. Friends. There are individual cases, such as that cited by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, but that is not the general experience of finance houses. I said that the proportion of loans that are more than two payments in arrears is the lowest for 10 years. That may be surprising, but that is what the finance houses say. Mortgage repossessions fell 43 per cent. in the second half of 1988, compared with the same period in 1987. Borrowers who are six
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
months or more in arrears account for only 0.5 per cent. of building society borrowings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are individual cases, but it is important to keep the problem in perspective. As my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) said, many good things have come from the credit revolution. If the hon. Lady thinks that the supervision and regulation of credit organisations should be strengthened or tightened, the way to do it would not be through the new clause or by involving the Inland Revenue to take a view on bad debts, but by amending the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which the Government have already considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dunfermline, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the 40 to 50 per cent. interest rates charged by store card companies? Does he condemn those interest rates as hard? Enormous profits are being made at the borrower's expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment without knowing the details of cases. There is more opportunity for people to compare, to use the market place and to find competitive credit rates. There are more and more entrants into the market even for credit cards, which helps the downward pressure on the rates of some of the existing lenders. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady put her case effectively, but I cannot commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Abbott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members were so overcome by gallantry when I began that they did not appear to listen to what I said. I attacked not the provision of credit or of credit cards, but the irresponsible attitude of many lenders. I seek to ensure that they take sufficient care in offering credit and that they check whether people can pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, with every appearance of confidence, that lenders do not seek bad debts. I was trying to flag up the problem of store cards. Stores charge interest rates of 40 or 50 per cent. because they do seek bad debts. They do not check; they give a card to anyone who applies, and give instant credit. They have to charge interest rates of 40 per cent. and more to allow for the bad debts that they know they will incur. They are prepared to give cards when they know that a certain percentage will not be able to pay because they do not want to lose custom and good will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed to consider the problem of store cards because he did not listen to my speech about their level of interest compared with Visa, American Express and so on. Stores do not carry out the same checks as other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a specific new clause on a broad issue. The Consumer Credit Act 1974, which the Minister mentioned, is widely acknowledged as sound, but it is not properly policed. There are many solutions to the problem of credit unwisely dished out. We could follow the Australian system: in Australia, if an organisation gives credit without checking that the applicant can pay, the debt can be written off. We could impose fiscal measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
It is unfortunate that Conservative Members were so overwhelmed in the closing minutes of the last sitting of the Finance Bill that they did not listen to my arguments. If they had done so, they would have recognised their sound basis. The new clause supplies the solution to the extortionate rates of interest charged for store cards. It flags up the candy-floss nature of the Lawson boom. However, as we shall raise the matter on the Floor of the House, I beg to leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crowther. This is the moment for which everyone has been waiting. On behalf of the Committee, I thank you and Mr. Cormack for presiding over our proceedings in a firm, efficient and fair way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one point when we were talking in the Corridor, Mr. Crowther, you secretly confessed to me that you did not find all the proceedings of this Committee as gripping as those of some others. I was rather dismayed as you made the identical comment to me this time last year. Even though you thought that it might have been better to be listening to or playing with the Rotherham jazz band, we hope that our sittings have not been too terrible for you and we thank you and Mr. Cormack very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank Mr. Rose and his staff for all their help, especially to Back-Bench Members who wished to table amendments. I am sure that I speak for the Opposition as well. I also thank the staff of 	<i>Hansard</i> for carefully reporting what we said and what we meant to say although, I hasten to add, there has been no tampering with the 	<i>Official Report.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Opposition and their Front-Bench spokesmen for making their arguments fairly and stronly while keeping our proceedings on an amicable and friendly basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank my hon. Friends. Several of them have a particular interest in many of the matters in the Bill. I am grateful to them for their restraint and keeping their contributions brief and pertinent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Cormack, in particular, got very exercised about all the jargon in our debates. He became especially worried when my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) said that the Merchant Navy ought to operate on a level playing field. My hon. Friend obviously believes that it was the battle of Trafalgar and not the battle of Waterloo that was won on the level playing fields of Eton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) was also rather exercised about the amount of jargon. I noticed that he intervened last week when I used the word ring fence. He thought that it was a terrible piece of jargon and that we should confine ourselves to terms that could be translated into latin. I thought that we could arrange for the Bill to be available only in Latin. Phrases such as "to ring fence" would be "in orbe circumdare" and "a level playing field" would be "campus ludis exaequantus".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Corby was wrong to say that "ring fence" did not appear in the "Oxford English Dictionary". I take everything that my hon. Friend says on trust, but I have my own copy of the "Oxford English Dictionary" and I confess that I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
looked up the word ring fence. It has existed since 1769, so it is not just a piece of jargon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank everyone who has been involved in the Committee. We have had a long Bill—dare I confess—with 180 clauses and it has grown longer during our proceedings. I am indebted to everyone for the fact that the Committee has run so smoothly. Thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crowther. Since the Committee began, enormous events have taken place outside the Committee, such as by-elections, county council elections, European elections, two test matches and—as far as the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) is concerned—Wimbledon as well. It is a tribute to the determination of all members of the Committee and especially of the Chairman that we have got on with the work of discussing the many, varied clauses—even to the extend of discussing, on Tuesday, the writing-down allowances of pig farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank the Chairmen for their handling of our proceedings. The Opposition know of the tremendous qualities of Mr. Crowther, because he is one of the most respected members of the parliamentary Labour party, and a distinguished member of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. We were fortunate to have him governing our proceedings. He has been fair, firm and friendly and I am grateful to him for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know Mr. Cormack as well as I know Mr. Crowther, but the Opposition are grateful to him for the way in which he has handled the Committee proceedings, and we look forward to him chairing future Finance Bill Committees. I notice that he is not only a Chairman of Committee and a distinguished speaker, but a distinguished author. I am assured that his book "Heritage in Danger" is not an history of the Conservative party, but I notice that this hobby, "fighting philistines", is registered in "Who's Who". Only Mr. Cormack can tell us the conclusions that he has drawn from the Committee's proceedings over the past few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to thank the Clerk and his staff for his advice and for the patience that he has shown us with our new clauses and amendments; the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff who have had to make sense out of much of what we have said and who have loyally reported all our proceedings; the civil servants who have had to sit through the proceedings and the long-suffering members of the press who, I hope, will continue to report our proceedings when they go to the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank my Front-Bench colleagues who have borne nearly all the work. My hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown), for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) have done so with such distinction that it may be unlikely that I shall be in this position next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank my hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) and for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) who whipped the Committee. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
Committee has been disciplined and has got on with the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all my Back-Bench colleagues. Last year everyone commented on the excellent Labour Back Bench criticism of the Bill and it has been equally good this year. I am sure that next year many of my colleagues who are now on the Back Benches will be on the Front Benches, either in the Finance Bill Committee or elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To Conservative Members on the Front Bench I can only say that we wish them well in the coming few weeks, as the Prime Minister makes up her mind. We note that the chairman of the Conservative party has been missing on a number of occasions, and we have expected an announcement about his future. That is yet to come. I think that the right honourable Gentleman was perhaps following the debate on the taxation of redundancy payments with a great deal more interest than was shown by Opposition Members, but I wish him well in the next few days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Economic Secretary to the Treasury is not here. For him, clearly, the Finance Bill is not yet finished, because he has to search in the City for a certain amount of lost money in VAT payments—a matter to which we shall return on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate, in particular, the Financial Secretary, who has shouldered most of the burden of the Finance Bill on the Government side. I congratulate him on defeating more of the Bill's clauses than even the Opposition did, by withdrawing a number of them. He has perhaps lived up to his claim on Second Reading that he and his Government intended to soak the rich. That was to be the aim of the next exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget and the Finance Bill were summed up best in a letter from the chairman of the Conservative party in the City of London, whose Member of Parliament is, of course, the right honourable Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Peter Brooke). The letter was sent to Conservative party members, and it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This year's Budget has been described as "dull" but so was Sir Geoffrey Howe's Budget of 1981—the one which laid the foundation of our current economic success.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>One of the architects of the Budget this year was the man who controls public sector spending. John Major MP … is the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and is frequently described as a future leader of the Conservative Party."</p></blockquote>
If anyone wonders where he has been, he was addressing a meeting of the City of London Conservatives on the Budget while we were here debating the Finance Bill. But the final paragraph is the best part of the letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of us have jumble that we would like to get rid of but don't know where. The constituency women have the answer."</p></blockquote>
The party chairman who wrote that letter had her priorities right about at least some aspects of the Finance Bill. We have enjoyed debating it, and we look forward to continuing debate on the Floor of the House. We congratulate all those who have taken part in it and, in particular, we thank you, Mr. Crowther, and Mr. Cormack, for the diligence and friendliness with which you have conducted our proceedings. We look forward to having you back in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that hon. Members realise that everything said in the past 12 minutes or so was out of order, but it was difficult for me to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely improbable that I shall be back in future years, but I am sure that my co-Chairman will be back next year. Both of us deeply appreciate the kind remarks that have been made, and for our part, it has been an easy Committee to chair. It is a very big Bill, as has been said, but it has been dealt with in a business-like manner, and the sittings have been characterised by good humour and courtesy. That makes the Chairman's task a simple and pleasant one, and we are grateful for the way in which all members of the Committee have carried out their duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
My colleague Mr. Cormack had the benefit of being in the chair on the occasion when we had a debate on a level playing field being surrounded by a ring fence, and I was pleased to note in 	<i>Hansard</i> that, next year, he proposes to impose financial penalties for the use of clichés. I hope that he will raise a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I speak for us both when I say that it has been a very pleasant duty to chair the Committee, and I thank all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
