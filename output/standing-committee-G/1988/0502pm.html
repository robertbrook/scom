	<p>"() (1) Schedule 3A (Consultation before Disposal to Private Sector Landlord) of the Housing Act 1985 shall be amended in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
	<p>(2) In paragraph 3(3), leave out everything after 'and' in subparagraph (3)(a).</p>
	<p>(3) After paragraph 3(3) insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) The authority shall then make arrangements for such independent persons as appear to it to be appropriate to conduct, in such manner as seems best to them, a ballot or poll of the tenants to whom the proposed disposal relates with a view to establishing their opinions about the proposed disposal.'</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>In paragraph 5(1), leave out everything after 'consent' where it first appears to the end of the sub-paragraph and insert 'unless it appears to him that a majority of tenants to whom paragraph 3(4) above relates have expressed their support for the proposed disposal; but this does not affect his general discretion to refuse consent on any other ground.'.".—[	<i>Mr. Blunkett.</i>]</p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us whether he intends to go ahead with a transfer if fewer than 50 per cent. of the tenants support it? We want the democratic aspect to be positive, not negative; we want a majority of the people who live there to be in favour of it. Anything less would be hard to justify in democratic terms. If fewer than 50 per cent. support the transfer, will the Secretary of State give his consent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) get away with the speech that he made before we adjourned for lunch this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, it is clear that our parties do not completely trust each other on large-scale voluntary transfers, perhaps also on tenants' choice under part IV of the Housing Act 1988, and perhaps even on housing action trusts and the voting procedures that apply there. I do not say that in any personal sense, because I genuinely believe that, in his speeches, not only this morning but in the past, especially on the Floor of the House, the hon. Member for Hammersmith believes what he is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, Conservative Members mistrust the line that is adopted by the Official Opposition party
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
as it goes round the country. I choose my words carefully—obviously, they are not confined to the hon. Member for Hamersmith—when I say that the fear of God is being put into the minds of many tenants. Tenants do not know where they stand, and it is our intention to build sufficient protection into the legislation so that tenants who have an opportunity to exercise their choice, whatever it is, do so while in the possession of as many facts as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is outrageous. I have challenged the Minister time and again to give examples of my putting the fear of God into tenants by saying something unrealistic or misleading, but he has failed to produce any. I have produced dozens of examples of what he has said, and I understand from what he said this morning that, to some extent, that has been taken on board and the Government have now corrected the leaflet. I am delighted to hear that, but the Minister cannot then tell me that I am the one who is doing the misleading; he and his right hon. and hon. Friends are doing the misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that misleading material is being distributed in council estates, is going into tenants' letter-boxes, and that tenants are reading it. No matter who is responsible for that material, whether it is the National Association of Local Government Officers, or even members of tenants' associations—we all know that there are people in a number of tenants' associations who are politically motivated—the leaflets are very misleading, and the hon. Member for Hammersmith is wrong if he is not prepared to denounce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was careful not to say that the hon. Member for Hammersmith is seeking to mislead the tenants. I am saying that we have a store of material in the Department of the Environment that makes it abundantly clear that misleading information is being given to tenants. It is beholden on the Official Opposition party to denounce that material whenever and wherever it appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the hon. Member for Hammersmith and me is that the hon Gentleman believes—no matter what he says to the Committee—that, in 99.9 per cent. of cases, local authorities and their housing management are better managers and landlords. The hon. Gentleman believes that, if the local council housing stock had increased more than it has in the 44 years that have elapsed since the second world war—to bring it up to the highest level the country has experienced and the highest level in the Western world—and even if it had increased substantially more than that, that would have been right. That is the hon. Gentleman's point of view, but I cannot accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been very careful during the Committee's proceedings not to denounce local authorities in general because that is where I served my apprenticeship. I accept that the vast majority are good but the Government want to give tenants the opportunity to exercise their right to choose an alternative landlord in the same way that they have the right to choose whether to buy their homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Truro)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My party has never opposed the idea that tenants should have that opportunity. The problem arises from the abstention voting system. To be honest, in his comments this morning, the Minister made it clear that he is not entirely certain that it is a good system, but he is justifying it on the basis that the Labour party or others may give misleading information. That cannot be right. People may vote, for all sorts of wrong reasons, for or against the system, but it is wrong to weight an electoral system on the basis that they may do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will return to the kind of voting system that is undertaken, and who undertakes it. That is the essence of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essence of what we are now debating has nothing to do with the tenants choice in part IV of the Housing Act 1988. We fall foul of the difficulty we had this morning in that the hon. Gentleman is talking about an entirely different form of voting system—tenants choice—and what happens to people who choose to abstain. The hon. Member for Hammersmith did not fall into that trap. He knows that we are talking about large-scale voluntary transfers which have nothing to do with the Housing Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith does not need to be concerned about this matter. It is clear from the Secretary of State's decision with regard to the voting in Torbay that what he seeks in theory, he is getting in practice, and I am not empowered to go any further than that in Committee. In other words, if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State decided that the Torbay vote, which he correctly described this morning, were clear evidence that the majority of people were not against, Opposition Members would be leaping up and down, as would many Conservative Members. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not do that but the hon. Member for Hammersmith did not refer to that or pay him credit for his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, in practice, the hon. Member for Hammersmith will get what he is seeking. That is about as much as he will get out of me today. I assure him that I have not the slightest intention of changing anything in the Bill which would make us change our literature, or the signals going out to tenants who, seemingly, we both wish to educate as best we can. To make such changes would be a retrograde step and lead to greater confusion that would not be in the interests of tenants. Deep down, the Government have the interests of those tenants at heart, not the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Blunkett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Brightside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we have cut through the verbiage, we are left with two simple facts. The first is the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). The Minister is worried about his job. He is not empowered to do more than watch the lips of the Secretary of State and see whether we decide to trust him to do what he did in Torbay again—as long as we run a sufficiently high-profile campaign in the media to ensure that he has no choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
The second fact is that, although schedule 3A of the 1985 Act and section 61 of the 1988 Act makes sense—we all agree, including the Minister, that that theory will be the practice—nothing will be changed on the face of the Bill in case the wrong signals go out. The right signals from the debate are that more than 50 per cent. of tenants in any ballot who are entitled to vote should have to vote yes before a voluntary transfer under the 1985 Act takes place. If we can get that message across, these last few weeks will have been worth it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DUTIES OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(1)(a) It shall be the duty of every local housing authority to cause an inspection of their district to be made from time to time with a view to ascertaining whether any residential property is empty and to keep records of all such inspections.</p>
	<p>(b) It shall be the duty of every local housing authority to consider the housing needs of their district with respect to the use of empty residential property and for that purpose to review the information which has been brought to their notice either as a result of inspections and surveys carried out under sub-section (1) above, or otherwise, and as often as the occasion arises, or within three months after notice has been given to them by the Secretary of State, to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State proposals for the use of empty residential property.</p>
	<p>(c)A local housing authority shall provide annually to the Secretary of State a statement of its strategy for bringing into use any residential property which it holds or has acquired, and which has remained vacant for six months or longer, and any such strategy statement shall be available for inspection by any member of the public at the offices of the authority at all reaonable hours, and any member of the public may make a copy of such strategy on payment of a reasonable fee.".</p>
	<p>(2)(a) Where a local housing authority is satisfied that:
	<ol>
	<li>any house, or self-contained separate flat within a house, which is empty, or</li>
	<li>any building which contains residential accommodation comprising one or more separate dwellings which are empty</li>
</ol>
and has remained empty for a period of at least six months they may serve on the owner of the house or building a notice requiring him to submit proposals for bringing the house or building into residential use.</p>
	<p>(b) A person upon whom a notice is served under sub-section (1) above shall within 21 days either submit to the authority proposals to bring the premises into residential use, or notify the authority of his intention to do so within a reasonable period of time.</p>
	<p>A person need not submit proposals under sub-section (2)(b) above if he seeks exemption for one of the reasons listed in Schedule 12 of this Act and if such reason is accepted by the authority Section (1) shall not apply to such properties.</p>

	<p>(3)(a) A local housing authority may make an order under this section (in this Part of this Act called an Empty Property Use Order) with regard to any empty residential accommodation within their district if the person or persons having control of that accommodation have failed to provide satisfactory proposals for the use thereof or have failed to implement such proposals once agreed following the service of notice under sub-section (2) above</p>
	<p>(b) An Empty Property Use Order shall come into force as soon as it is made and as soon as it is practicable after making the Order the authority shall enter on the premises and take all such steps as appear to them to be required to enable the premises to be rendered capable of providing accommodation that will comply with statutory conditions.</p>
	<p>(c) Once an authority has taken steps under sub-section 3(b) above to render any properties capable of use then the authority shall use the premises as residential accommodation and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 of the Housing Act 1985 shall apply to any tenancy granted pursuant to this subsection.</p>
	<p>(d) Any tenancy pursuant to this Section of this Act shall, for the purposes of Section 118 of the Housing Act 1985, be deemed to be a secure tenancy and the provisions of Part V and Scheule 4 of the Housing Act 1985 shall apply to any such tenancy, provided that the right to buy given pursuant to this sub-section and any discount allowable shall not be exercisable in respect of the property occupied pursuant to this Act but shall be excused pursuant to Section 35 of the Housing and Building Control Act 1984.</p>
	<p>(e) A local housing authority may discharge its functions under sub-sections (b) and (c) above by making arrangements with a housing association or other voluntary body concerned with the provision of housing accommodation.</p>
	<p>(f) An Empty Property Use Order shall last for a period not exceeding five years at the end of which time either—
	<ol>
	<li>the authority may, with the consent of the owner, extend the Order for a further period of up to five years, or</li>
	<li>the authority may issue a Compulsory Purchase Order on the property, or</li>

	<p>(b) If a complaint in writing that a notice should be served under sub-section (2) of this Act or an Order made under Section XYC of this Act, is made to the proper office of the local housing authority by—
	<ol>
	<li>a justice of the peace having jurisdiction in any part of their district, or</li>

	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee, despite the fact that the new clause is lengthy. The text has been lifted from the relevant parts of the Empty Property and Community Aid Bill 1987, which failed to gain sufficient support when it was introduced on 16 November 1987. Before the Minister says it—no doubt he will—I must observe that there are mistakes in the drafting, which arise from trying hurriedly to put the new clause into an acceptable form. The cross-referencing in the new clause is inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the new clause gives councils a duty to inspect their district to see what empty
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
properties there are. They must think about how empty homes can be used and prepare and make public an annual strategy for their use. By putting these provisions in the Bill we would meet part of what the Government claim is their aim—to put more empty housing, especially local authority housing, back into use. The first part of our new clause embraces that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would extend further. It mentions the private sector and provides for an examination of the use that is made of private sector housing stock. This is important for a number of reasons, not least because it introduces an element of balance to frequent Government criticisms of local authority housing and draws attention to the fact that much private sector housing lies empty. If there is a problem throughout the country with underused housing stock, it is in the private sector rather than in local authority housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would require local authorities to be empowered in some circumstances to do something about that problem. That is important because many local authorities face difficulties when tackling apparent housing need. I have argued that some of those difficulties arise from the Government's financial provision for local authorities, but they go beyond that. Many local authorities have difficulties because of a shortage of land. In inner-city areas it is already built upon and what remains available is in private hands; in rural areas, local authorities have little or no land, especially where it may be most pressingly needed such as in smaller villages and rural towns. There is great need, but a virtual inability to meet it at a cost that the council can support because it cannot afford to buy land, and has none itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our new clause would empower local authorities to put empty properties to use. The Minister may not like its terms. I tabled it as a probing new clause rather than something more specific. I want to judge his reactions to this great housing need, empty properties in the private sector and what can be done to put them back into use. The clause would give councils a new power in the form of empty property use orders, which they could serve on long-term empty houses, although only after owners have been allowed to submit proposals to use them themselves. This is an extension of the control order provision of the Housing Act 1964 which applies to multi-occupancy housing. Under this power, an authority would be able to use empty property for five years, either itself or in conjunction with housing associations or self-help groups of homeless people, and then return it to its owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would enable local authorities to obtain vacant possession of the property when EPUOs expired. A safeguard for owners is the proposal that the time people have lived in a property should count, towards the right to buy, so that any discounts accrued can be transferred to other properties in a manner similar to other schemes for housing association tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People would also be able to complain to a justice of the peace if they felt that a property should be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
subject of such an order, and a JP could require a council to consider proper action. The new clause is about trying to do something about speculators who hold on to empty properties in the hope of making a fast buck at the expense of local people who cannot get housed. It is about helping local authorities to meet the needs of people on the waiting list and their legal obligation to house the homeless in good conditions rather than in bedsits and damp and condemnable caravans—as happens in much of the south-west and other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is also about trying to even the balance. Local authorities are required to take action, but the same applies to the private sector and to property that is in Government hands. Indeed, the Government's record on dealing with their own empty properties should shame them each time that they condemn local authorities for underusing properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the new clause contains errors. I do not expect the Minister to accept it, but I hope that he will comment seriously on the problem of the under-use of the housing stock outside the local authority sector. What will he do to help local authorities to make use of their under-used housing assets instead of simply launching continual attacks and criticisms of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. We sympathise with the aims of the new clause. Indeed, as has been said, a Bill on the matter is coming before the House. The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) rightly said that the new clause is designed to probe. The provisions in the early part of it would involve much organisation and work, but that is precisely what will happen with the poll tax. The Government will have to establish which properties are empty. That might be the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have thought of that one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it might be the answer and perhaps it is. It is one way in which to proceed. The problem is severe. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Government are the worst offenders of all. Close to 6 per cent. of their properties are empty. The private sector is the second worst offender with just over 4 per cent. Housing associations come a good third with 3.1 per cent., and the figure for local authorities is 2.5 per cent. There are a variety of differences between individual local authorities and housing associations but, overall, they are good and the private sector and the Government are bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, we received more Government figures. I am not surprised that the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) has taken up what I can only describe as a Back Bench position at the end of the Front Bench. Clearly he is anticipating what will happen next in his career. He sits in his constituency of Suffolk, Coastal, and sends me answers—I am not sure whether he drafted them—which confess that no less than 5.5 per cent. of the Department of the Environment's properties are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
empty. Would the Committee believe that one region in which those properties are located is none other than Suffolk, Coastal? All those empty properties are in the Minister's constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And without central heating!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, without central heating. Obviously people are expected to be hardy in that part of the world. The Minister has the audacity to attack local authorities for having empty properties. He is sitting on the wall. If he is not careful, a large number of homeless people will be looking at those properties. If the Minister does not already offer those properties for use, he should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time ago, innovative local authorities launched schemes with a lease-back arrangement. It was a good arrangement that could also be used by private owners. It is used by some local authorities. The Government are the real offenders. The Department of the Environment comes out very badly. I do not have all the figures, but can confidently say that only the Ministry of Defence looks like beating it hands down. Others are almost, but not quite, as bad as the Department of the Environment for having empty properties. What an appalling record that is for a Government who attack local authorities. The Minister may well turn around to explain to his Back Benchers, but they do not look as though they accept his explanation. The only thing that I would accept from the Minister is his resignation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said many times, when the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) becomes personal, we know that he is on weak ground. That was yet another example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) expressed his case very fairly and I accept that the new clause is designed to probe. He may not be surprised to hear that I am prepared to accept the spirit enshrined in the new clause and shall suggest a better solution. He is right to say that the Government are worried about empty properties. We are concerned about them, irrespective of whether they are in the local authority sector, housing associations or the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro will accept that it is not easy to detect empty properties in the private sector. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has made the superb suggestion that perhaps we can uncover some empty properties through the implementation of the community charge. It is a rattling good idea, and I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government is in Committee to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is looking for helpful suggestions, the new clause has one other advantage for local authorities. If they can threaten to take over empty houses for the homeless, people may be keener to sign up to pay poll tax than to avoid it. The Minister may get a double bonus that I did not intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept any more offers? The administration already works extremely well. In Scotland the number of people registering for community charge is high. It is 100 per cent. in some places, and we are always a little suspicious of that figure. I do not want too much help from Opposition Members. Otherwise, so many people will demand to pay community charge that registration will be more than 100 per cent., which would be highly embarrassing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—especially in view of the number of attacks launched against the Government on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that some people have registered in more than one place, which explains the high figure? If people register in a house that would otherwise be empty they pay only one poll tax. Otherwise, they would have to pay two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies I must point out that we cannot now have a debate on the community charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Truro and for Hammersmith for their suggestions on new clause 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sympathetic to the reasoning behind the first part of the new clause as I share the views of the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Local authorities would be required to maintain a register of all empty property in their area and to produce a strategy for its use. Clearly, better information along those lines and a co-ordinated policy are desirable prerequisites for taking action to get empties back into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith says that the Government continually attack local authorities for their lack of speed in bringing empties back into use. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and I have been careful to cite several Labour-controlled authorities which behave extremely well in this regard. We have heard at least half a dozen times about the London borough of Barking and Dagenham, which performs extremely efficiently. We are not colouring all local authorities with a broad brush.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble is that we cannot get the official Opposition to accept the inefficiencies of several Labour authorities, principally in the London area, which do not perform in that way. We hope that they will respond not only to our overtures but to those of the district auditor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not happy to accept the inefficiencies of any local authority that does not make proper use of its housing stock—although there can be various reasons, not unconnected with Government finance, for failure to remedy the state of properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reciprocate and own up to the fact that sometimes Departments cause problems, especially the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Defence. I welcome
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
the spirit of the Minister's remarks, but he has notably failed to refer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to that. I urge the hon. Member for Truro to be patient. Conservative Members do not seek to hide anything; we have nothing to hide. I am the first to admit that performance could be improved dramatically and I shall certainly discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In support of the hon. Member for Truro, the hon. Member for Hammersmith said that a considerable burden would be placed on local authorities if they had to catalogue where empty properties were. The new clause suggests that local authorities would be responsible for identifying empty properties in the private sector. Responsibility for cataloguing empty properties should not belong solely to local authorities. I believe that I can carry both hon. Members with me when I say that it should be the responsibility of all social landlords, including housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that, as a result of undertakings by other Ministers in the Department of the Environment, we are prepared to look carefully at the question. Partly as a consequence of amendments tabled during the passage of the 1988 Act, officials in my Department are currently working with local authority associations on a joint exercise to put together more detailed and up-to-date data on empty property. Local authorities have completed a survey of their dwellings and the results are being analysed. We are also looking to compile better data on housing association stock and dwellings owned by Government Departments, and it is right that we should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give me any information about the study being undertaken at present? How does it categorise short-life housing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no way of knowing the details of the study, but I am happy to find out. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to tell the Committee what perhaps should be done by way of a separate survey, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) and I have resolved our not wholly irreconcilable ideological differences, we shall write to the Minister on this very subject. Together with the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) we are about to contact the Minister on an all-party basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee with the difficulties as you would probably rule me out of order, Mr. Hunt. The problems to be resolved hinge to some extent on how we classify short-life property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. My understanding is that we are not including short-life property in the study if the short-time definition means homes occupied under licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the Minister and I am surprised because the information that the Department is seeking should already be available under the rating regulations on empty properties. Local authorities are obliged to press for empty rates on habitable properties that have been empty for six months. Rating departments of local authorities must maintain records for private-sector houses, so the information should be readily available. I should have thought that the Minister could answer the question without going through all that rhetoric.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like many other things, that may be the efficient system in Wakefield, but it sure ain't the system down here in London. Part of the time we do not receive up-to-date records and part of the time we do not get any figures at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith is fond of talking about the study of Professor Maclennan at Glasgow university. We both used the survey to great effect to prove that the other was wrong, but the hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot deny that the study team was not allowed to survey property in London. Those authorities missed a golden opportunity as they might have made a useful contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before you rule me out of order, Mr. Hunt, I shall return to the new clause. I am happy to be on record as saying that the study should also examine dwellings owned by Government Departments as there is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs. The study will provide a more informed basis on how to make best use of stock, including whether statutory measures, such as those proposed in the new clause, are necessary. I understand that local authority associations welcome the study and are working closely with us, but until it is complete the first part of the new clause is premature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enormous sympathy with the first part of new clause 26, but I have considerably less sympathy with the second part. Those members of the Committee who served on the Committee which considered last year's Housing Bill will see that it is similar to one which was tabled on that occasion and which proposed the imposition of empty property use orders on private empty dwellings. Our position remains the same as that put in Committee last year by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave), who at the time was the Minister for Housing and Planning. Any proposals that would empower local authorities to serve such orders and allow the takeover of private dwellings for five years—I stress that there was to be no compensation of any form—are wholly unacceptable. The fundamental objection, which we have made clear on the many occasions on which the question has been debated, is that it would be an unwarranted expropriation of private property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Truro told us that there would be a system or right of objection, but we did not get round to talking about financial compensation. I am not nit-picking, because I realise that the hon. Gentleman moved the new clause as a probing amendment and simply wanted to know what the Minister would say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
Powers already exist under section 17 of the Housing Act 1985 for compulsory purchase of property for housing purposes—power which, unlike the new clause, provides some protection for the owner by way of appeal and compensation. Therefore, those points are already covered. In addition, special arangements are available to expedite processing of applications, where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as Opposition Members are aware, we strongly believe that every encouragement should be given to the use of private dwellings wherever possible. We are committed to ensuring that there is an incentive to do so. The deregulation of the private rented sector, through the Housing Act 1988, seeks to encourage that, and I am confident that it will enable more of the existing empty private property to be brought back into use in socially beneficial ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with everything that the Minister said, for example, that compulsory purchase opportunities already exist. It is clear that he does not know the problems that local authorities have in paying for that. As I said earlier, the land is not available. Equally, the local authority cannot afford it. Nor is there the opportunity to buy in bulk because, again, the local authority cannot afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the review that the Minister has said is being undertaken, but I hope that attention will be paid to the way of dealing with the problem that exists in the private sector. While there are many genuine reasons for holding on to property that may be empty for a time, there are many that work purely to the disadvantage of the local community. There is always the problem of the speculator. Some people have holiday homes; others have homes purely as an investment. All of them can cause problems. In my area we have the problem of homes that are empty for 50 weeks in the year. Their owners keep them so that they can have a nice holiday for a couple of weeks, and then sell them at considerable profit, even after tax. Such homes are a good investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would not cure those problems, but it makes it clear that firmer action is needed than merely looking at the extent of the problem. That is the first step, and I am pleased that the Minister has undertaken to do that. Nevertheless, one way or another—perhaps through the tax system, through incentives, or through the opportunities afforded by the new clause—we need to tackle the problem of the large number of empty private-sector properties, many of which are in areas where there is the greatest housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to press the new clause, and as the Minister has come up with a satisfactory response to the early part of the new clause, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
The amendment is important because it seeks to find out the relevance of the right to buy to agriculture smallholdings where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the landlord is a smallholdings authority as defined in section 38 of the Agriculture Act 1970."</p></blockquote>
To any hon. Member who represents a rural area the purpose of the amendment is apparent. Such a provision is important in helping a local community to give the opportunity of the right to buy to those involved in agriculture. That will be of increasing importance as such opportunities become scarcer and more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with interest to the Minister's response and hope that he will find it possible to go some way towards meeting the amendment's intention to provide protection for the continuance of those opportunities as the right to buy takes effect. I look forward to the Ministers comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A central principle underpinning right to buy legislation is that tenants of properties held by local authorities for general housing purposes should have the right to buy their homes. That principle is just as important in rural areas as in major towns and cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where properities are held by local authorities for purposes relating to one of their functions other than the housing function, by and large, they are excluded from the right to buy. There are various exclusions from security of tenure, hence from the right to buy, in schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1985. Those exemptions cover properties which are let to tenants and required for operational purposes. For example, paragraph 8 of the schedule excludes premises on agricultural holdings occupied by persons responsible for the control of the farming of the holding. There are similar exclusions from the right to buy in schedule 5 to the 1985 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no current exemption for houses let to tenants on retirement. That is not accidental. A case can be made for excluding from the right to buy a property which needs to be kept available for letting because it is special in some way. If a retirement property is special in that it is particularly suitable for occupation by elderly tenants, it may fall within paragraph 11 of schedule 5. The paragraph excludes from the right to buy properties which are particularly suitable for, and let for occupation by, persons of pensionable age. A house offered to a service tenant on retirement does not necessarily need to be special. For example, within reason, it could be anywhere; there is no fundamental necessity for a smallholder's retirement home to be on the smallholding estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a county council rehouses a retired smallholder, it is supplying a home to someone who needs it, as distinct from providing housing relating to a person's employment. In that respect, it is carrying out a general housing function in much the same way as a district council would. In principle, there is no difference between properties let to retired smallholders on a smallholding estate and other properties let to retired smallholders or to any other people of pensionable age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the most pleasant moment in a Committee to congratulate the Chair on proceeding with our work so diligently. Sometimes those words are spoken with a certain care, lest they stray too far from the truth, and a certain risibility is found on the edges of the Committee. On this occasion, there is no need to be too careful with our words as the Chairmanship has been exemplary. We enjoyed the firm hand and steely wit with which you guided our
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
deliberations, Mr. Hunt. Please press our congratulations to your fellow Chairman and to Sir John Stradling Thomas who took the Chair on one occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my colleagues for their constant attendance and our spear carrier, the representative of the Patronage Secretary, who managed by a particular cast of face to keep in order those who might otherwise not have kept in order, except on two occasions when no cast of face would have worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the civil servants who so admirably produced the material for the Government. The notes on clauses were a great help and led us through some complicated matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee was forceful, effective and never dull. Even the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), who is not wild about Committees or Committee Rooms, may agree that there were moments of enjoyment and laughter which helped our proceedings. It was a good Committee. We learnt and argued a great deal. We did not agree about much, but it was worthwhile and we owe a great deal to you, Mr. Hunt, for the way in which you conducted the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a measure of our different perceptions that the Minister congratulated you on your firm hand, Mr. Hunt, but I congratulate you on your flexibility. On occasions you let us refer to a point that we would not have been able to mention, had it not been for your flexibility. I thank you on behalf of the Opposition. There was not a word of criticism about your chairmanship and I am grateful to you Mr. Hunt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a helpful Committee. I thank the Minister and his advisers for the notes on clauses which were most useful. To put it mildly, Opposition parties are never as well equipped as we do not have civil servants and other such advisers to brief us. I am grateful to our advisers who come from a wide range of voluntary, statutory and other organisations in housing and local government. What has been so helpful is how much they accord with our perception of the Bill as being legislation that should not remain on the statute book one moment longer than is necessary. It will go in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has argued the issues on a number of occasions. We have not heard the last of the arguments and no doubt we shall return to many of them on Report. Indeed, as we said, we shall wish to do so. On behalf of my hon. Friends, I thank you for your Chairmanship, Mr. Hunt, and your colleagues for their support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also thank you, Mr. Hunt. No doubt we shall return to fight further on some of these matters. I have enjoyed our Committee proceedings. There is one comment of the Minister's with which I disagree. There have been some dull moments, although most of them have not been so. I thank you again for how you have conducted our proceedings, Mr. Hunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
